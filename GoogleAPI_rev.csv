"My second review 😃
I came across Overdose Cafe’s Buy 1 Get 1 Free offer, and as soon as I heard about it I decided to head there myself and have some coffee! If you want to enjoy the offer yourself I’d suggest you to hurry up! The offer ends by tomorrow, The 16th of December.

I ordered an Iced Spanish Latte, Iced Salted Caramel with Two espresso shots, One Iced Red Velvet with a single espresso shot and One Iced Red Velvet with double espresso shots. That’s something they do that’s different from other cafes. Even if you don’t request them to do it, they’ll ask you whether you want a single espresso shot or double. Bonus points from those people who like to have more espresso in their coffee!

My drink was the Iced Red Velvet with double espresso shots and I was well satisfied with it. I’ve already spoken about my opinion on the Iced Spanish Latte and Iced Salted Caramel on my last post on Overdose Cafe.",4
"☕️ Overdosecoffee is one of the fastest growing coffee chains in the kingdom and for all the right reasons.

☕️ Their ambience is simple yet stylish with quotes all coffee lovers can relate to.
☕️ Love their efficient services with espresso glasses and cups ready with syrup to serve the customers as soon as the order is made.
☕️ The taste of their coffee does not disappoint and you are always left craving for more.
☕️ A dedicated space to watch your coffee being prepared is the cherry on top.
☕️ Overall, welcoming staff , cozy vibes and delicious coffee makes this place irresistible.

"Good coffee but crowded, singles were sitting in the family zone",4
I ordered the iced Spanish latte. It was fine but it doesn’t have a special flavor . It tastes like the same as any other Spanish latte. The place is nice but the music was way too loud. I don’t think i’ll visit again.,4

"The vibe is good, loud music though. Coffee is so sweet, and I think it’s only a single espresso shot which is not the standard that I see in all coffee shops (Double shot is the standard). Little bit pricey for the size of the cup and the single shot. If you like loud music come here",2
"It was not good enough ,not clean
My order was wrong and the prices more than the avrage.",2
Coffee of the day is amazing and atmosphere is great. The music list they have is complete rubbish!,3

"(Translated by Google) O no
The songs are very loud
The place feels like it is meant for women only
The men’s entrance is prohibited from entering the store’s airspace. The barriers on the second side are surrounded by intoxicating trees. The corridor is from us and from us so that you do not enter the second section.
Ok, I want the bathroom, as long as you can
In general, I entered the shop, my father, the bathroom was closed to the men, but I told the cashier that it is necessary, my father said the toilet. He said no, cameras are not allowed, and from this I said OK, a little while. One of the men came in front of me (for women) I said this is the entry. He said no, this is my brother 😂😂!!! !

Let's go to the important thing is the drinks

They all taste the same, they are all milk, there is no deliciousness in the drink

I mean the difference between the drinks is only color

The mojito is all ships

Hot Chocolate 🍫☕️

And when the Overdose is delicious 🤩😩❄️💙💙💙

weighted 👌

And the taste of the cream is a fantasy and is light and does not help 🤣🤩

Even hot chocolate without cream was delicious and had a slight bitterness, but it was sweet 💕😍

If you have not tried hot chocolate, they are right!!

"(Translated by Google) Good evening,,,
The problem is as follows:
I came to the place and talked to the security by taking a table, and he said that it was reserved, and I went to another cafe and I did not like it, so I wanted to come back again after about 15 minutes, and the security was talked again about the same table because it is the only one available, and he said that it is reserved, and I was entered inside the cafe and a conversation The official said that we do not have a reservation policy, and I told him that security blocked a table for a person for more than 15 minutes, and they talked to each other, and the security stated that the customer had finished the first drink; He asked for another drink but went to the bathroom!!! He will be back shortly.
* Hana explains to me:
That there is a contradiction between (the policy of the place and the official and the security employee).

مساء الخير،،،
المشكلة كالتالي:
تم حضوري للمكان ومحادثة الامن باخذ طاوله، وافاد بانها محجوزة، وتم ذهابي لكافي اخر ولم يعجبني، فرغبت بالرجوع مره اخرى بعد مايقارب ١٥ دقيقه، وتم محادثة الامن مرى اخرى عن نفس الطاوله لانها هي الوحيده المتاحه، وافاد بانها محجوزه، وتم دخولي داخل الكافي ومادثة المسؤول وافا بانه لا يوجد لدينا سياسة الحجز، وافدته بان الامن حاجز طاولة لشخص لاكثر من ١٥ دقيقه، وتم محادثتهم لبعض، وافاد الامن بان العميل انتهى من المشروب الاول؛ وطلب مشروب اخر ولكنه ذهب الى دورة المياة!!! وسوف يعود بعد قليل.
* هناء يتضح لي :
بانه يوجد تناقض بين ( سياسة المكان والمسؤول وموظف الامن).
* يجب احترام العميل ومراعات الحاضر للكافي اولاً وبعد ذلك العميل الذي سوف يحضر.

"(Translated by Google) The place for the secretariat is clean and the first time I come and their coffee is sweet in a natural way and the best way is to treat the cashier Muhammad to you. I congratulate you for the good hospitality, but there is something in my mind a lot. The secretary treats me frankly. There is no style or manners. Men say I am humiliated. You don’t like coffee. Trust in God. On the subject of tables, tell me, I organize in my own way, and I see people in my way. If you do not like something, trust God. Is this a method that a person can accept? Or are you enough to be satisfied that the secretary treats you like this? How do you want customers to come to you and when I am drunk like this, it is wrong. Sitting happens a lot. If someone else was quarreling with him and causing problems, but I congratulate the cashier for his approach and his acceptance of the situation and the solution of the problem. Thank you, Muhammad, for your elegant style. I hope you find a solution with the secretary. Your right and peace be upon you.

In fact, today my first experience with the café and the delivery was through the delivery program. When the order reached me, the men stood up and said, ""Come, you look wrong in ordering and bring a drink."" They were surrounded by nostalgia with a small cup of coffee.

I tried my normal nostalgia and my nostalgia with honey and I didn't notice a difference between them except that my nostalgia for honey is three riyals more expensive :)

The price is too high for the quantity and quality. Ordinary 22 riyals and with honey 25 riyals.

جربت حنيني عادي وحنيني مع عسل وما لاحظت فرق بينهم غير انه حنيني العسل أغلى بثلاثة ريال :)

السعر مبالغ فيه جداً على كمية الحنيني وجودته. العادي 22 ريال ومع عسل  25 ريال.

The music is excellent but the sound is too loud to be annoying. The volume is supposed to be balanced so that people can hear each other, and whoever is working on a need or doing something can focus. The visit was morning on Friday. The café is almost empty, and of course, there is no hot weather in it. The coffee is overpriced for the size, and the taste means just fine and not even good.

المكان بشكل عام لطيف لكن مساحة الجلوس الداخلية صغيرة جدا، الكراسي غير مريحة اطلاقا. ١٠ دقايق وتبدا تحس بعدم الراحة.  الموسيقى ممتازة بس الصوت عالي جدا لدرجة الازعاج. من المفترض يكون متوازن الصوت عشان الناس تسمع بعض وايضا اللي بيشتغل على حاجة او يسوي شي يقدر يركز. الزيارة كانت الصبح يوم الجمعة.  المقهى شبه فاضي وطبعا بهالاجواء الحارة مافيه احد جالس برا. القهوة مبالغ بسعرها مقارنة بالحجم، والذعم يعني لاباس فيه فقط وليس حتى جيد.",1

"My first time going here. I had been trying to get here for the longest but they are usually very busy which is never a bad sign. Today was burger Monday and I personally ordered the Social Smash Burger. It was perfect they way they made it. The other food that my party ordered was just as good and healthier options. I would definitely come back. I enjoyed the atmosphere minus the pigeons flying through from time to time but hey they were hungry too. It was too hot for alcohol for me this go round, however I am definitely looking forward to coming back for brunch. Thank you to our amazing server for making it a pleasure to eat here. Keep up the good work. 👍🏾 👍🏾",5
"Great place. Music was kinda loud so we couldn't hear all our conversations ( group of 11) great ambiance regardless. Waitress was nice. Food came pretty quickly.
Just a FYI, the smoked salmon Benedict meal, the salmon is cold and barely smoked. We switched it for the shrimp salad and it was good.",5
"We stopped here several times for drinks and meals during our stay in the adjacent hotel.  Other than very slow / almost non-existent service for our last meal, we enjoyed each stop.

The bar and beer selection, both inside and outside, were impressive (see pictures) and the process were in line with other places in the area.

We had the Chicken Quesadillas (see picture) one evening and really liked them - especially after asking for salsa.  The homemade salsa they brought was delicious and I would highly recommend that you ask for it with your meal.

The next day, my wife enjoyed Taco Tuesday (see player picture with one of each available taco on it) while I went with the chicken wings (see picture) and we both really enjoyed our selections.  This was the day the service was very slow though.  Not only was our original order slow in coming, but the requested additional tacos (all you can eat) and the wait to request our check were also very slow.  They did have at least one large party for graduation there at the time, so possibly that was the reason, but our server didn't seem to be waiting on them.

Overall, the food was very good and the pricing was reasonable, so we returned several times and I would recommend it as a stop.

"Grace was amazing!! She was prompt, attentive, and so nice. The drinks were really good. We did the Tiki Rita and Grey Line. The wings and chicken quesadillas were delicious. We came in late but still got good service and hot food. Will definitely  be back for sure. Thank you Grace for the amazing service.",5
"This is our go-to place before the hockey games. We love the atmosphere and the food is always good. Nice outdoor patio when the weather is nice, and inside has a cool upscale (but not stuffy) vibe.

As far as food, the Chicken Quesadilla is probably our fave so far! Chicken sandwich and burgers are always a good choice here. And their garlic Parmesan fries with truffle aioli are definitely worth getting, if you like garlic and/or truffles.",5
"Presently surprised at how good they're breakfast was. Really good deals on mimosas and we kept then coming all morning long and my tab was about 30$ plus food. The view from downtown is incredible and the property is spacious enough where you don't fell like you're on top of the other guests. The bar is beautiful and I'm sure it's a great time as the sunsets. Super cool if you have a boat and dock it here for lunch, etc.",4
"One of my favorite restaurant/bar franchises. The atmosphere is great; very welcoming and low key despite the larger size of the establishment. The restaurant and patio seating area are beautiful with gorgeous views, welcoming and attentive staff and a busy bar with well-crafted cocktails. Check out the cocktail and beer selection, you won't regret it!",5
"Fun spot to spend an afternoon. Extensive outdoor patio over looking the bay. Large portions, great food. Surprisingly large bourbon list.",5
Food was delicious and our server Riley was absolutely magnificent!! She was an amazing server.,5
"We delivered a balloon drop here for an event this evening as a vendor. The staff were great and easy to work with. An absolute pleasure decorating here. We are super excited and absolutely love working with this venue.

The valet was great. The management on staff was great. Even the servers smiled and helped to make our job easier. Highly recommend for private events!",5
"This was our second visit to American Social. We sat outside on the terrace. Once again we were very impressed! The entire staff is always so friendly from the host staff to our server. Service was excellent, atmosphere is fun and relaxing. We loved being by the water and being able to watch football on all the TV screens. Food came out very quick and was delish! We highly recommend. We will definitely be going back again. It's always a fun place to dine.",5
"I came early for my reservation by 30 minutes and requested to be seated at a table where several TVs would be within proximity. We got seated, and only half of the table could see TVs. We asked to be reseated and were told we’d have to wait over tables that has reservations. We got over that. And we asked to have the TVs changed because only one game was on TV. The manager could only play two games at a time. That waiter did try his best to make us happy.",3
Nice outdoor seating on the water. The turkey club and shrimp arugula salad were delicious!,5
"The food and service was not bad. The view was very nice. But the music was so loud we couldn't have a conversation. If you're looking for a more intimate setting, this isn't the place. More for the college age crowd looking to be seeing.",3
I consider Avocado Toast  a simple meal. They made it taste so much more than a normal dish. the meatball had a lot of cheese. The environment was very good. Food tasted great!,5
The atmosphere was pleasant. The staff was welcoming. I was  little disappointed with the fact that the tacos didn't come with any sides like fries or a side salad. The food tasted good,4
"Went here with my family for a late lunch. We’re on vacation and wanted to eat next to the Tampa waterfront, everyone thought the food was delicious. Recommend the wings, spinach artichoke dip and devils eggs.",5
This place is so fun and has an absolutely amazing view. I had the Mac and cheese for the first time this weekend and fell in love. It was so flavorful and the steak was amazing. A bit expensive I’ll say to add steak ($8) but still really good. My favorite drink is the Rhiskey Pineapple. I also had the Beyond Burger before and loved it! I highly recommend this place for anytime during the weekend. I do recommend you make reservations though because it can get packed sometimes. All around great place and great food! Servers are also friendly. They also have a Veterans discount which always makes me happy!,5
"You have to get the PBJ drink!!! The best thing I have ever had. So good. The waiter we had was amazing. Ironically, his name was PJ and they call him PBJ! 🥰 Also get the Mac and cheese. I can't wait to go back 😩 😫  also the music was amazing.",5
An excellent experience all around. Our bartender Stephanie was beyond wonderful. Will continue to return (probably Monday through Friday.),5
"Staying here for a convention, and came here day 1. I will definitely here more during week, the patio has a cool atmosphere, music, outside bar, and friendly wait staff. Lunch was great.",4
"Wonderful ambiance for an afternoon meal on the waterfront with terrific view. Waitstaff was very attentive. Food was delicious. Hummus was fabulous: rich and savory. Blackened mahi tacos and ropa vieja (braised beef) tacos were cooked perfectly, flavorful and very satisfying. Guinness on tap was a bonus!",5
"Great drinks,  good food, service ok.. really busy",4
"Some yummy drinks and shareables, although can get very crowded esp during game nights. Friendly staff. Big range of cocktails, from barely-alcoholic tasting to super strong!",4
Visited on a Tuesday night and had a good time. The staff is very accommodating and the food was fresh and tasty. The location right off the water is really a big part of the draw to American Social too. Our party ordered six different items and everything was good. The deviled eggs with candied bacon and the shrimp cakes were among the favorites. I ordered the horseradish burger and it was very good—although it did lack much of any horseradish. The garlic parmesan fries upgrade is worth it. They’re very good. Overall everyone was very happy. I’d come back again for sure.,5
"Had peel and eat shrimp, oysters, broccolini and donut holes.  All was scrumptious specially the broccolini and crepe filled donut holes ❤️",4
"Summary: Come for the view, not for the food.

We had gone there for lunch at 1:00pm on a Wednesday. The server was nice but was slow in checking up on us and getting the order to our food. The wait time to get our food was very quick though. They were understaffed with 1 bartender for the whole lunchtime and the food overall was subpar.

Nashville Hot Chicken: a crispy but overly greasy fried chicken sandwich. The hot sauce was more oily but couldn’t tell if that was the chicken or the sauce. Needs some lettuce and tomatoes to freshen up the taste. 2/5

Horseradish Cheddar Burger: the patties were warm, not hot (I should have complained but the wait was already long to order our food and our server took a while to come back to us). Barely tasted any horseradish and the sauce was too much. 2/5

Goat Cheese Croquettes: these tasted good but there was something about it that tasted cheap, like getting food from Disney or Universal studios. 3/5

Fries: best part of the meal 4/5",2
"Such a nice bar/dinner place. Lovely service and a great view. Their covid safety could be a little better, but with the 18-30 year old crowd not wearing masks inside, I don’t think they’re concerned with this issue. I recommend sitting outdoors.",5
The soup was yummy! $4 wine at happy hour. And the view. They turned on the heater for me and they punch your parking ticket. Great place for lunch or dinner or drinks 😊,5
"Great place to grab brunch. I would say the wait is usually worth the experience, especially if you are dining outside. Great selection of food. I've eaten here quite a few times and I've never been disappointed with a dish. The mimosas are really affordable and they have a few different juices to choose from. Service is really good here. They are quick to accommodate and resolve any issues.",5
Great atmosphere and great servers. Jasmine gave great suggestions for food and drinks.,5
"Good food good times! We were there celebrating a family members birthday so we were a large party. Service was great our glasses always full, and our appetizers and entrees came out in a very timely manner. Everything was great. We chose to sit outside to enjoy the nice weather. And the Casey Stidham band was playing good music and taking request.",5
American social is great. They have the best food and environment to socialize with friends and family!! We go all the time and everyone that works there is awesome; next time you go to the bar ask for Stephanie!!,5
Great food and social hour vibes 👌🏾,4
Delicious food and awesome drinks.  I really enjoyed the music.  The singer had an amazing voice.,4
"American Social is in a great location.  It is on the waterfront and has outside seating and bar.  The food we ordered was great and not overly priced, granted it was for lunch.  The service was fantastic!  Very friendly,  polite,  and fast service.  Would recommend outside seating!",5
"Food was mediocre! Drinks were good and I loved the atmosphere! There was a DJ at Sunday brunch which was fun. Our server Sydney was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of! I'd definitely come back for some good drinks and fun, but chill vibes!",5
Great food. Love the views. Fast service.,4
This place is it! Fast efficient service and delicious drinks and food! Music played was throwback 90's it was ALL GREAT.,5
Amazing atmosphere and even better service. Stephanie went above and beyond to ensure our night was a great one! Will most definitely be back. Maybe we’ll drink less rumpleminz next time.. maybe not,5
We asked how long it would take as we had to leave for a flight in an hour. We were taken out to the patio.  We ordered after about 20 minutes. We were assured the food was on its way. After waiting for over an hour for our food we left. We tried to flag down someone and no one would even look at us.,1
"Great food we enjoyed, the person who served us she is wonderful 👏 thanks.",5
"Good atmosphere, and decent food. My biggest pet peeve when it comes to seafood is when they offer fish blackened, and then it comes out as obviously grilled with some weak seasoning sprinkled on after the fact. I wish restaurants would actually learn how to cook, or at least not false advertise. My grilled mahi sandwich was ok.",4
"I was in town for a wedding and this place was recommended by our Uber driver. Freaking fantastic. Drinks, service, atmosphere, and food. All fantastic. There was live music at the time we went and instead of being seated directly in front of the loud speakers we were thankfully given the option to wait for a better table to open up. For a place this busy it would have been so easy to seat us in front of the speaker and not care, that's the extra level of service that makes me want to leave a review. Oh yeah, the pretzels. Eat the pretzels.",5
"Delicious food, friendly staff, clean environment. I definitely will be back to this spot.",5
"We booked American Social for our wedding after party.

The staff was fantastic leading up to and through the event! They made us feel special and we could tell they went the extra mile knowing how important this day was to us.

Whether you're looking for a quick bite to eat, a fun night out, or planning and event, AmSo is a fantastic option!",5
"For being happy to have dinner at a place that was open later than 10pm on labor day the service was far too mediocre. The bartender/server wasn't promptly attentive as my friend was trying to wave them down to ask a question as well as not knowing that the restaurant was out of what my friend had ordered, which was not told to us until all the food was served. My food was fantastic as was my friends, however for a place with yachts docked and great food and decent drink options the service from entrance to exit felt like that of a low level regular chain restaurant. This is still a decent place that I can recommend, but the experience from the staff we interacted with was fair at best.",4
"*5 STAR EDIT AT BOTTOM*

FIRST VISIT:
They didn't seem too busy, but were still understaffed. Didn't get my water until after about 10m of hanging out at the bar. Made sure to have my whole order ready ASAP. Was in the building way longer than i needed to be for a simple lunch.

Had the smash burger. Sauce was salty, fries WAY overdone, missing onions. Didn't see bartender back and had to ask another server for water and napkins. Ingredients and menu seem like they have the capabilities of a 4-5 star place but my experience was nothing above a 3. Will be back to give it another shot, but this first time wasn't great.

EDIT:
MUCH better the 2nd time around. I had a feeling I caught them on an off afternoon before, this was not that. The pork was incredible the char perfectly complimented by a smoky whiskey BBQ sauce. I would get the brussel sprouts even as a meal on its own it was so good.

Plus, I sat at the outside bar where they had plenty of TV's and sound for the football game, add that to a fantastic view and this place really has the makings of a phenomenal spot to go on your own or an inexpensive yet impressive date as well. Will definitely be back.",5
Date night. Our server was Aldina! She was awesome! Very attentive! Very kind! Very knowledgeable about the menu! She didn’t let us down with her recommendations! I had a passion fruit mojito which was full of flavor & a mahi sandwich. They were not skimpy with the fish ! Atmosphere was great 👍🏾 not too busy & not empty . Closed at 12am on a Sunday ! Can’t wait to go back :),5
"This review is solely based off our brunch experience this past weekend. We've been to AMSO a few times in the evening for drinks and the DJs but decided we wanted to try out the brunch experience. We made reservations which they limit to 2 hours per reservation, which is fine except our food order took over an hour to get brought out to us and they really were not that busy. Any other time this would have been a huge issue but we were enjoying each others company so the time passed relatively fast. I ordered the Hot Chicken Sliders which to my surprise does not come with any kind of side included in the $15 price and I couldn't believe how small the sliders themselves were. My biscuits were all hard as a rock and I ended up only eating one, I took the others home with me (you can see in the second photo the ""chicken"" was 90% batter and 10% chicken). I ended up just throwing out the other two sliders. My partner ordered a burger and was overall underwhelmed and didn't like it.  The patty was again really small for the price of the meal. We of course had to get mimosas to go with our brunch and they have an amazing deal of $3 per mimosa, except that wasn't the case, they were $5 each. Our waitress didn't tell us of the price difference and we found out when she brought the receipt. By that time we just wanted to leave so we didn't mention the discrepancy to her. We picked outdoor seating because come on.. the view is amazing! But the fans they have running are SO LOUD no one at our table could hear each other and we were actually yelling across a 4 person table to one another. This is the first bad experience we have ever had here and wont be returning for the food but always have a great time going for drinks and watching UFC or a game on their TVs which they have located everywhere!",2
Riley was amazing as our server tonight! We had a party of 15 and she didn’t miss a beat. She was so attentive &  a gave good recommendations on dishes.,5
"I have had take out from this location before and the food was good. September 23, 2021 I dined in and was WOWED! Tonia was my server and she could not have done anything better. The team at the bar were so friendly and cohesive, I have to say this was my best bar experience ever. I was fortunate enough to relay this to Jordan the manager when he came to process my Groupon voucher. I have already planned a return for the following day!!",5
"American Social is located on Harbour Island down town Tampa. This restaurant/bar has the best water views of down town. I have always had great service and the bartenders are very friendly. Due to COVID-19, tables are limited. You are required to wear a mask. If you don’t have one they will provide one. They have the best burgers in town. This is a place to be for happy hour. Great value. At 8pm the music volume increases as the place turns more into a night club. I would recommend this place if you work downtown, date night or visiting the area. You will not be disappointed.",5
"I loved our experience at this place. We had some issues and were running late for our 2 pm reservation. We called and they let us know it wasn't a big deal. When we got there, they seated us at a table with a loveseat and chairs. I have severe back issues, so the couch was perfect and so comfortable. The drinks were really good and so was all of our food. We ordered the deviled eggs, goat cheese croquettes, wings, pork belly, steak skewers. The pork belly was our absolute favorite. The view from the restaurant was beautiful. Our waitress was very nice and worked her a$$ off. There were only two waitresses while we were there. So that was a small negative. But we still got pretty decent service. We would go back and recommend.",5
"I like this spot. Clean, good food and drinks. It’s a bit pricey though but it makes sense because of the location. They have great happy hours",4
"Nice restaurant. Items seemed to be a little pricey for the type of restaurant it was. We got the artichoke spinach dip with pita chips and it was delicious! It took our server a little bit to come greet us, but she was extremely nice and took good care of us.",4
Went for a birthday that was never acknowledged despite making a notation in the reservation. Also requested outside and that was not honored. Service was very slow. Definitely not a spot to celebrate any event. This was definitely a miss.,2
I Suggest getting there early if you go on a Sunday the food was really good but it was really busy and noisy but thats ok.,4
"Had brunch here today(Sunday) arrived around 11:30 and wanted to sit outside but was told they were fully booked and should have made a reservation. Got seated at a inside hightop booth with a baby in a high chair and had to ask to move table as the baby was about a foot away from the table top. Got moved to a suitable table and ordered food, the brunch burger and a chicken Cobb salad. Had to tell the waitress that the avocado in the Cobb salad was rock hard and inedible(she brought out some extra avocado) and the hash brown on the brunch burger was oily and burnt. The burger was cold and the chicken was very bland.

The manager gave us the food for free(got the feeling this happens a lot), might try the place again but not for brunch.

Two stars because it's a nice location and the staff were friendly.",2
"Great spot for an afternoon lunch or evening dinner and snacks. Beautiful views right off the water comfortable setting, and tasty food. Enjoy the trip there.",4
"Nice place.  It's  Florida chain with good food and nice drinks.  There is a pretty good Happy Hour.  The view on the Patio over the channel is great.  But they get busy, so you need a reservation to get a table on any popular day at peak hours.",4
"AmSo (as the locals call it) is delicious and fun. Absolutely gorgeous views of the water, and you can relax comfortably inside at a table or the bar, or outside to enjoy the weather and people watching. The food and drinks are delicious and fresh. The service has been very good every time I've been. I take my family there, and hang out with friends for a fun morning brunch or to watch some football. Also a great night scene!",5
Loved it!! Great vibe! Diverse crowd on the water and the food was amazing. If you are an animal lover your pets are welcome on the patio as well!,5
"Had a wonderful experience. I ordered the Riley sandwich and side salad. Sandwich was well portioned and the side salad was much more than I expected with ingredients that were fresh, crisp and well presented.

Now the staff. Our waitstaff was amazing. From the time we sat down to the moment they started shutting things down due to hurricane Elsa, everybody was friendly and very attentive to our needs. I commend them on the quality of people they have working there.",5
"Great place with great views! Live music.  it gets packed and loud, a lot of fun to go to",4
"I absolutely LOVED this place! We went for a girls brunch and had a great time. The live music was perfect.  The portions were generous. The menu was very unique.  Everything was delicious. I had the iron biscuit dish which was great! Everything my friends had looked so mouth watering delish. You get unlimited mimosas with an entree of $12 or more, until 2pm. This was a huge surprise! Our waiter, Morgan was awesome and so friendly. The place is very large and has a nice private bar area. Being on the water makes the atmosphere even better. You can sit inside or outside.  There are many different areas to choose from to cater to whater vibe you want during your meal. I can't wait to go back for a  couples date night!",5
One of my new favorite places in Tampa! Food was exceptional as well as the drinks! The vibe was amazing with great music suitable for all ages and the Dj was amazing at brunch! The patio seating gives you a great view of the water as well as the outside bar seating. Can’t wait to go back!,5
"Dining here was an experience,food was great,service great,our view was awesome!!! I've decided for my birthday event to be here..",5
"My husband and I decided to take his parents to lunch for their anniversary. We were concerned because it was a very lively atmosphere...as opposed to quaint, which we were concerned his parents would've preferred. They had the Tampa Bay lightning playing, as well as dance music and it was very hot outside. However, for us, the atmosphere was fun and exciting. What made it even better was our waitress, Paige. She checked on us consistently. She made sure we had everything that we needed and was on top of everything before we even thought to ask her for help. She made their day special and I feel all around we had a great experience, thanks to Paige! My husband and I will definitely come back again, as I'm sure it's even more fun in the evening. I forgot to mention that it's right by the water, so you get to watch all the boats and again this is a lively atmosphere which I'm sure is very exciting in the evening hours!",5
Always a pleasure.. great food and music..beautiful view and atmosphere,5
Erica was such an amazing waitress. Very friendly and awesome. Definitely recommend American Social for brunch. Food is amazing and drinks are strong and delicious. You won’t be disappointed.,5
Food was good when I received it. They initially brought out the wrong thing. When they eventually brought me my mahi tacos they had one piece of pepper on each taco and barely any lettuce. Also the birthday brownie tasted terrible. I’d rather eat a brownie out of an easy bake oven.,3
"Beautiful Water Views with a Hip Vibe...

Unique Menu that was Delicious...

We just Stopped for a Light Bite and I Can't Wait to Go Back to Try More Things...

Chicken Skewers with Black Bean Hummus... Apricot Taziki and Grilled Pita Chips was Outstanding...

Deviled Eggs were Delicious...

We Will be Back!!! 😀",5
"Great view of the river. Nice outside area.  Drink selection was above average.  Good food, but kind of a smaller menu.",4
Absolutely superb food and atmosphere! We enjoyed the service and the food was outstanding! Drinks gave our experience the added touch to a perfect dinner !,5
Brunch party lunch dinner drinks. This place has got it all. And it is huge. 3 bars outside 2 on the inside. We even did huge event for 500 people here. Decent service. Decent food. Great place to spend a Sunday morning with friends. Sit outside on a mild summer day enjoy views of the water and the channel.,4
Very disappointed... Been there twice before this visit and only was able to enjoy once! Had family visiting the last two times and both times was told 30-45 min wait and became almost an hour and 30mins. Thank goodness restaurant next door was available and had a Great time!!!!,2
"Had our Company get together tonight, awesome spot and Rick the owner is amazing.",5
"So put my name on the list as it’s typically busy on the weekends. Normal hour long wait which is not the issue. Was waiting at the bar for bar seating after being there 40 mins as a gentleman was getting up went to take his seat. The bartender then proceeded to tell me no I can not take the seat due to someone else had been waiting, as she had not seen me standing there for a while now. She said “these people have been waiting for a bit” not longer than I have and bar seating is first come first serve. My friend and I could have stayed but after arguing with the bartender about my right to a seat and she would be serving me just wouldn’t have gone over smoothly.",1
Sat outside by the water. Good food. Nice waitstaff.  Didn't feel rushed even though the place was packed. Parking was pricey in the underground garage.,4
"I sat outside, where were the fans? I think they're only by the bar. I ordered the whole wheat pancakes with a side of eggs and my bf had the breakfast pizza without cheese. We liked our food. Would return and sit inside....
Overall think it's a great location for brunch/lunch because of the view.",4
"Wow! Sit outside, even in the summer for a great view of downtown Tampa. We came on a Sunday and the food was delicious and the mimosa were cheap! I would recommend getting a reservation on OpenTable or something because the wait would've been around half an hour. I do have to take away one star because the parking garage (underground) meant for the plaza was packed, had a confusing layout, and cost around $10 for the time we were there.",4
"Worth the half hour wait to get a table. The food was good and service even better.
But don't come here if you are wanting a quiet place.",5
Excellent Bloody Mary. Service was great and the biscuits & gravy were on point. Love the atmosphere as well. All around great spot for food and drinks.,5
"Great place to eat, drink and listen to hip hop music at night. By the Bay Area",5
Dining Next to Beautiful Yachts is something I've never done. The view is impeccable. Our server was deep dead gorgeous and very courteous. I'll be back when I come to Tampa...,5
Stephanie is is the most amazing and drop dead gorgeous bartender in tampa!! I ask for her every day!! I hate when she has days off!!,5
"Absolutely phenomenal. If I am anywhere near the area, this will be the place I will come to if I need a good beer, great food, and a fun atmosphere. On top of that, the service is second to none.(Randi you were awesome!) Came there three times in a three day period so I experienced both the lunch period and the night life of American Social. Both times were a blast! I couldn’t recommend this place enough!",5
"Great food and drinks. Fun on a normal day, even better for sports.",5
Not only do they have 3 dollar mimosas for brunch on Sunday but the food is magnificent and the vibe is super dope. Definitely day party vibes without all the fuss. Super cool staff and always a interesting group of folks. You'll get your money's worth and have a great time!!!,5
Great food and music. Social distancing doesn't exist though.,5
"Restaurant was really hard to get to. Google Maps took you in a whole different direction. Once you found the place, it's a good little hike to get to it. Outside seating is nice, good breeze from the water. Service was really poor and our waitress had an attitude the whole night. Food was very inedible and flavorless. Tried this place once with friends, don't think I'll come back unfortunately.",2
Great spot with good food!,5
"Excellent attention, incredible food, it is the best food I have had in Tampa. My compliments to Chef Freddy. All spectacular. I would repeat this place without hesitation",5
"It was very busy, 1hr wait to be seated which I feel was a bit long. One set/group of tables was being unutilized, I'm not for sure if they didn't have the wait staff for it or what. The food was good, I had a burger and fries and they came out perfect. I'd go back but not on the weekend. If you decide to go reserve a table.",4
"Excellent spot to do happy hour or watch football! Alex is a fantastic bartender, she knows exactly how to make mimosas! :) Highly recommend!!",5
One of my fav spots in Tampa for sports games. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich is absolutely flame! 🔥,4
"Good place to eat, the outdoor seating has a nice vibe, and the chicken sandwich was really good. Our server Riley was super friendly and sweet!!",5
"The place looked cool and the servers were nice. However it was so so loud that we couldn't even hear the other people at our own table. We order all you can eat tacos ($15) and we had to wait about 30 minutes for them to bring us each round. The food was good, not great. It took long for us to get everything we asked for: hot sauce, to go boxes and especially the food.",3
"I don’t normally do these things but WOW! I came in this past week having never heard of American Social before. I got the shrimp and arugula salad which was fantastic and an old fashioned which matched the salad. We had a young girl named Rylie as our waitress who had a smile plastered on her face the entire evening and made best friends with my 8 year old son. She kept our drinks full and the table clean along with giving my son a pink flower as we were leaving, he still has it. Definitely a great time. The whole staff was very friendly and helpful from pointing me in the direction of the bathroom to getting me more silverware when my son dropped it. Great service, great food. We will absolutely be coming back. Thank you!",5
"Good social gathering and drinks.

The drinks were pretty good but I do not think the food options were that good.
Appetizers: The spinach dip was amazing, the brussels sprouts were good also but the deviled eggs were pretty much put down and frowned upon by everyone at our table.
Main Dish: I had the poke tuna tower which tasted pretty good (just wish it came with rice also like my other normal poke bowls), several family members had the meatballs and grits and they did not like them (some said their food was cold), one person ordered the mahi sandwich and said it was dry, my son had the macaroni and loved it (I think it was overpriced) but overall it was a good environment as far as scenery
If you are mainly focused on drinks and scenery then I say it doesn't get much better seeing as though this restaurant gives waterfront view, but I personally think there are other places downtown with better food for cheaper or the similar prices that also have great drinks and a view of the water.",3
"I’ll keep it short: the food was awesome, the drinks were perfect. I’ll also like to thank our awesome server, Celina. Great hospitality!",5
Love the atmosphere....This was my 2nd time there and the views and feels of the place are hard to match. I had a rather simple garden salad w/ chicken and added a handful of shrimp to it and  Ended up spending close $30 for the salad alone.. The chicken was kinda bland as well but ok since it was in a salad with other toppings.  I will likely be back...just selecting something different this go round.  Cool place overall. Also you pay for parking in the garage...no street parking that I could really see.,3
"For anyone that enjoys a fun night at the club, I highly recommend this restaurant! The DJ had a very good assortment of music, the waiters were very good to the customers, and the food was very good! Great place, five stars.",5
"Large place but very noisy. They had the game on loud to compete with the music and the music up loud to compete with the game.  Super crowded on GameDay. Food was average American fare. We had nothing remarkable. The best was their ""pigs in a blanket"" which is closer to a ham roll.",3
"Went on a Monday before a Tampa Lightning game playoff game and they were very accommodating. On Monday's they have great burger specials, I got the AMSO Burger for $7, an amazing deal. They also have drink specials, I highly recommend going there during 'happy hour' when their specials are almost half off.  Great venue with a great view.  Def recommend for a chill spot to hang out in downtown Tampa.",5
We each had lunch specials ... I had pepperoni pizza with Caesar salad and my boyfriend had the burger and fries both come with a non-alcoholic beverage.  We sat outside in the covered area overlooking the water. There are several TVs and you're allowed to smoke cigarettes or cigars there.  This place is also pet friendly.  Our server was Chris and he was very attentive.,4
Delicious food with absolutely amazing views. So generous with their food too. OMG!,5
"Not good for dinner. Feels like trying to eat a meal in the middle of a club, with people bumping into your seat and the music so loud you have to scream across the table. We got one drink and left. Armature works has a great outdoor atmosphere with music and lots of awesome food choices, so if you're looking for a spot for dinner on the water, that's my recommendation!

Also, the door by the entrance from the road was not clearly marked at all as being exit only. Just some feedback. Feels really weird to be turned away by a bouncer when you're just trying to go to dinner. I think this place seemed to have a cool clubby atmosphere, but if they want to do that, they should close the restaurant after a certain hour. They don't mix well.",1
Great place to grab some drinks with friends on the water. Their brunch menu is pretty amazing too but make sure you get there early.,5
"I had a great time here! The food was yummy and the drinks are awesome! Alyssa was our bartender and she did great. There were some ""Karens"" next to us at the bar that gave her a really hard time but she handled it like a champ. The service here is awesome. Its a great place to relax with friends and drinks",5
"Terrific restaurant and bar - great food and great service, plus I absolutely adored the decor of old Life magazines adorning the walls. Great place to grab a meal or some drinks - either indoors, or else outside by the water...",5
"This place is awesome, the views are spectacular. I ordered the long Island iced tea and my husband ordered a Jack and coke, both were perfection. Food is spot on, I give it 4 stars and not 5 because the two young women who were hosting, seemed very unorganized. We waited behind a group of 5 for 15 min while they bustled around without pause. Finally coming to the conclusion they could infact put two tables together🤦‍♀️",4
We had our son’s wedding rehearsal dinner here last week for 100 people and Adam Perhosky and his staff did an outstanding job!  The food was perfect and the bartenders Ari and Devin were friendly and efficient.  For a group this size this was the perfect location for us.  It was a cocktail style party that kicked off the wedding weekend perfectly. I can’t say enough about how great the staff was and I would recommend American Social highly!  Thank you for making our important evening perfect!,5
"This was my first American Social visit to any location after hearing the reviews. The location was in the heart of Tampa, Florida next to the Tampa Convention Center on the water. The views were amazing and the music going during happy hour. I ordered various appetizers from the Devil Eggs, Buffalo Wings and a few cocktails. The staff was full of energy on a Friday night heading into the evening. The weather was a challenge and the staff mad sure we still had an area to enjoy our Friday. We had great food, drinks, football, and made some new friends. What can I say? This is a must see and a place that I will return to visit when I’m in Tampa.",5
The staff was great. The portions were generous! The food was delicious!,5
"I have been here many times before, have often not had the best experience with service (food and everything else is always great) tonight to celebrate two friends birthdays, we had a big group and had Hope as a server. She is absolutely amazing. I’ve worked in the service industry for 10 years and couldn’t be as great as her. Timely, happy, knowledgeable, fast, and overall perfect. Couldn’t have had a better server. Keep doing what you’re doing Hope!!",5
"Five stars for food, service and atmosphere!",5
"Amazing location/views. Amazing food. I mean, absolutely 💯 on the chicken tenders. Best in town actually. No dance floor",4
"Great food, great drinks, outstanding customer service. I left a persona belonging at the restaurant and Jason, GM, went above and beyond to find it and then ship it to my home address. I would highly recommend this place if you’re in the Tampa area!",5
"This place was so great. Service was awesome, waitresses were great, I definitely am going back.",5
"Good food, the inside is nice, the outside doesn't have enough shade.  The Nashville hot chicken sandwich is awesome.  Really good value with a friendly and helpful staff.",4
Great views good service,5
Food and drinks were great. Our server was hella cute too. Ask for Previn! I’ll def be back :),5
"it was ok , just odd how you have to walk through another restaurant and a hotel lobby to get there , we a private party and it rained they are not equipped to handle getting thought the maze they created without getting wet. food was good .",4
"If you are visiting Tampa, this is a must visit place, good food, drinks and view 9f the river",5
"Atmosphere was great, however the brunch was sub par at best. Food was cold on arrival and very bland. Fun place for a cocktail but I would definitely eat elsewhere",2
We loved the atmosphere and meals. Great view of Tampa Bsy. Our waitress was fabulous.,5
"Good food, good vibes. We sat outside on the patio and the ambiance was great. Brunch was good, $3 mimosas and really great shareable plates. We will definitely return!",5
"American social is located in one of the prime spots in Tampa with an amazing view. Bottomless mimosas are the best part of their brunches. The staff are extremely friendly and know the menu very well. They have a killer list of cocktails which you should try. The reason I give them 4 stars is their food, their menu has interesting choices but the taste is decent.",4
"Went for brunch this weekend.  We were seated with a reservation and we're told ""you have 2 hours then you have to go"".
What?
There were 6 of us, we ordered drinks no problems.
It took forever to get our order in.  I was asked what temperature for my burger and waited over 40 minutes for the food.
The burger was so thin that you couldn't cook it to desired temperature.  I've had thicker patties from fast food chains.
The fried chicken sandwich was dry and cold.
Another chain that fails to provide decent food in a decent amount of time.
If you like to hang out and be trendy you should go to American Social.  If you want decent food at a decent price within the to e you're allowed to be there, stay away.
Staff was very nice and accommodating.",2
"My experience at American Social has been an unforgettable one. The variety of drinks, the view, the service, the cleanliness, and the pretzels is what has been this a great experience. This is definitely a place where I would return to.

HOWEVER, the DJ is below average. The DJ has limited range of genres (rap), tends to play median average beats that discourages the customers to dance, enjoy and spend money. My night started very active and engaging. As the night went on, the choice of music started to decrease in quality which discouraged me from continuing to spend money and made me want to also leave.

The DJ needs to have more variety of music choices, especially Latin music.

Overall, a great experience that was stained by the DJ",4
Really great place for the younger crowd but the lack of masks and ANY social distancing makes it a no-go place for me.,2
"Food was good, drinks were strong, however service was poor. I had to ask for my appetizers and by the time my entree came I wasn't hungry anymore.   Last, food was very expensive. I spent 154.00 on hamburgers, fries, and tacos with a round of drinks for 3 and a 30.00 tip 🥴",3
The service here was amazing thank you to all the staff who worked today on Mother’s Day. They truly made my family and me so happy. The atmosphere was exceptional. The prices were affordable. The DJ was doing an amazing job as well. Highly recommend people check this place out.,5
"We had an excellent meal at American Social. This was our first time eating out since the pandemic began over a year ago, and since we were fully vaccinated we were very excited to go. We made reservations for outdoor seating. The patio was full but tables were well spaced and they had hand sanitizer stations located throughout. We waited a bit to be seated despite our reservation, but not too long. The menu is what I would consider to be upscale bar food and the cocktail and beer selection was excellent. Our food was delicious and arrived quickly. Riley was a fantastic server. It was a but pricey in my opinion, but considering the location on Harbor Island, that is to be expected. Overall, a very enjoyable experience.",5
Riley was amazing first time going to American social and she made it so pleasant we will be back!,5
I had a reservation for my sister’s birthday. Walked in to check in but instead of the host greeting me she overlooked me and tried helping a lady BEHIND me (due to my skin color) saying “how can I help you” to the other lady who came in AFTER me. I had to acknowledge I’ve been standing here for 5 minutes and no one tried to help. I will NOT return to this restaurant I’ll weather  spend my money some where else!,1
celina was amazing!!! me and my girlfriend went this friday for our first time and she definitely made our experience memorable!!! WE LOVE HER! WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK!xoxo,5
"The view is beautiful and the atmosphere is nice but the prices are not.

Now, my wife and I went to this restaurant to try out the food. While the food is pretty good, the drinks are creative and delicious, the atmosphere and the scenery is exemplary, the prices are not. A salad should not cost a person $14. I do understand that you're paying for the scenery and you're paying for the picturesque views but it is hard to imagine paying that much for them. Also, if you are over the allotted two hours that you can have validated at the restaurant, you have to pay additional fees for parking as well. It's good to try out but I will definitely not go back.",3
Heaters outside were nice.. It was cold after the lightning game,4
The view of Tampa and the surrounding bay is amazing. The drinks can be pricey but you pay for what you get. There is usually live music and a fun atmosphere.,5
"I had a pretty good time at the American Social last night 5/30. The cocktails were tasty and the deviled eggs were amazing. I’m pretty sure I received the wrong burger, I ordered the horseradish burger but received the normal one, it was still good though. When I went I didn’t realize there was a lightening game on so it was very noisy outside but I guess that should have been expected. I don’t really like having to yell to have a normal conversation because of blaring speakers so I’m not sure if I’ll be back. The service was average, could have been a little better since we had to wait to be seated even though we had reservations, but it wasn’t bad. I wish I knew to ask about validating my parking garage ticket, I saw that complaint a lot in the reviews.",4
"If you're looking for a fun local hangout this is your place. Iutdoor dining, great food,  awesome bunch, great bar, fun atmosphere. Busy scenery, weekend is always popping here!!",5
"Nice vibe, friendly staff, clean and the food is ok. A great place to chill with friends and make new friends. All ages and stages!",4
"Great service, great drinks, even better food. Elevated bar food. I love that the serve food late too!",5
Fun restaurant and bar with a great atmosphere! I recommend making a reservation if you are coming with a big party as it does get busy. It is very easy to do on their website. The food and service was amazing! The only reason they aren’t receiving a 5/5 is because unfortunately there was a bug (small beetle) in my friends salad. BUT management was very quick to take care of the situation and gave us our next round of drinks for free. Things like this happen at every restaurant so my friend was understanding of the situation and was pleased with how it was handled. I will definitely be coming back for some more nights of fun!,4
"Bottom line, drinks and social atmosphere are a hit but the food quality is not on par with the local competition.",3
Food was really good and Previn (girl scarecrow) was awesome and really funny. Be back for sure.,5
Our delightful server Licia served us a delicious Salmon dinner.,5
"Vibe, service, presentation, & food exceeded expectations! I will definitely be back when in Tampa!",5
"Superbly decked out eatery in the heart of Tampa Bay! Great selection of drinks, food is on point and scrumptious and the staff is very friendly!! Nice view of the bay and directly across from Amalie Arena Go Bolts!",5
Huge fan of the ribs and wings dish. The bbq flavor is on point and the ribs were falling right off the bone. Nicole did a great job recommending food and drinks for us. Will definitely need the lavender drink again,5
Food was good. Server was better. #Riley,5
"Great food! Highly recommend the pretzels! Amazing service, Riley was great!!",5
This place is amazing.  The food is incredible.  The staff was very friendly.  I was in town for work for 5 days.  I found this place on day two and ended up going back 3 times during the rest of the trip.  The chicken sandwich was phenomenal. The meat was like twice the size of the bun.  So much flavor. This is my new favorite place whenever I come back to Tampa.,5
"Very nice restaurant,  delicious food, friendly staff...but it took forever to get our orders taken and even more time to get our food. Good thing we ordered cocktails or we would have been ticked.  Perhaps more  staff is needed.  Would I recommend this place?  Heck yes, but plan on being there a while and ask for a table with a water view.",4
Great hangout. Live music. Excellent bites and cocktails 👍👍,5
"Horrible. Bartenders were unfriendly, smiled zero times, not helpful and seemed annoyed to tend bar. Food was fine but nothing special. Will avoid next trip to Tampa.",1
Great drinks the staff was all very friendly and the place was busy. Food was good and lots of options to choose from.,5
"The view outside was awesome , the food was ok . Ordered the braised beef tacos which was good , the salad was ok , Buffalo chicken fries ok . The drinks were ok but I definitely recommend using a flavored rum or alcohol in addition to the purees used and regular rum or alcohol, makes a huge difference .Tried to order a drink at the bar but she rudely said I had to wait for my server who was overwhelmed pulling her weight with a lot of tables . Didn’t see the issue since she was free but at that point decided never mind and just waited for the check . Wouldn’t return",1
It's a bar that serves some bar food. Don't go there if you are looking for a menu much more then just bar fare. Had the Mac n cheese was ok not great.,2
Any time I’ve ever been here has been a fabulous time. Definitely my favorite place to have a great time in a great environment,5
"American Social is an indoor and outdoor restaurant. And even though most people enter from the outside you have to go inside to get a table. The bar and all the tables nearest the water are high top bar tables The actual outdoor dining tables are inside that ring but you still get a partial view of the water.
Service - we were seated and given menus. A wait person came and took our drink order   We got our drinks delivered by someone else and then we waited. Something happened to our waitress and eventually we got a new waitress and the manager came by to apologize. Also,  the manager came back sgain to check on us later. Our second waitress was excellant. So a good on service.
The food - I ordered the vegetarian chili and my husband got the steak Sammy. The vegetarian chili was spicy but not too spicy with perfectly cooked vegetables. It also came with a piece of cornbread which was good but all cornbread today seems to have turned into a cake. The chili was a nice size portion. The steak sandwich was very good. It came in a canoe shaped bread. It's sort of an upscale Philly cheese steak. Better steak and cheese than a  PCS.  It also came with seasoned fries, not fresh cut.
The restaurant is waterside restaurant with corresponding prices but these were not high for that.  The restaurant was clean and inviting. It was clean with linen napkins and real silverware. This restaurant is handicapped accessible only from the street side not from the water side. It does have handicap accessible restrooms.",3
"Yuppie social scene. Nice riverfront restaurant and bar for young socialites. Pretty much like every other riverfront bar downtown. Staff is great, though. Very responsive and quick to fill orders. Several tended bar areas to choose from on a Saturday night. Drinks were good. The best part is the riverfront access to lots of surrounding places and niches. Good for an evening walk.",3
Brought a few of my friends on a Friday night to enjoy dinner & drinks. We all had a wonderful time!,5
"I love the view and the ambience. Good music, good drinks and good food.",5
Nice place on the Riverwalk! Service was great. Food was OK. I had the smash burger and the brioche bun was a little stale. My wife had a Cobb salad which she really enjoyed. Overall a very nice brunch,4
Nice place in downtown Tampa. The food is good. Recomended,4
Lovely place! Better people and food!!,5
Great place to spend time with friends while having drinks.  The location has beautiful views of the the Bay.  Service and fos are both great.,4
Great view.  Food is decent. I'd go back,4
"Good food, but commenting on the service by A.A. Asked what type of vodka they have she kept on insisting Tito's. Remind you this is the bartender. I said ill pay cash but she insisted i leave my card to open up a tap. Paid the amount due. When I received my cash bach it said 12.31. She gave me 12.00 back with no change. Remind you this all took place in less than 10 minutes after entering and sitting down. Why would  I leave my card or trust the bartender if I can trust the bartender to give me back 31 cents. 30 minute wait time on buffalo chicken fries.",3
Food was great and loved the atmosphere! Right on the river in downtown Tampa. Can’t go wrong with this one.,5
Great place for lunch. Very fast service. Good vegan options.,5
"Amazing views of the bay with a great atmosphere. Food is great, drinks are good and fairly priced. Be aware that Saturday’s they have a DJ inside so it can be loud if you’re looking for a quiet spot. Overall, a great spot to visit",5
Crystal the manager made our night. Great service. Excellent food. We live downtown Saint Pete and work with hospitality business. (We are servers as wellllll) 👻 thank you guys. You are awesome 👏 Bravo!!! 🥰,5
"Good food, great service.  Will have a long wait for the tables and the bar is packed.",5
"Great place to eat or have a few Great cocktails. The place is very clean, modern decor, and they play really awesome music on the weekends. Good place to hang out with friends and party!",5
"It was not bad.  Food was just so so.  Not worth going back to.

This update is per your response to my rating.  Unfortunately the phone number you place was incorrect as when I text the message the owner of the phone says they do not own a restaurant.

I visited the restaurant on advice of my date.  She try to make substitution to the menu an was told either you don't have the substitution or substitution was not allowed.  Next she ordered a long Island Ice Tea an I ordered a Sangria.  She told me the drink tasted like it was coke an ice an that all.  An my sangria was very bitter tasting.

I ordered the shrimp appetizer as the waitress inform me there was no more oyster.  Big disappointment for me as I love raw oyster.  The menu was quite limited and my dates wings an ribs were awful, she said the ribs tasted like someone poured barbecue sauce over them an they were tough.  The wings didn't appear to have any Seasoning.  They were tough an hard to chew.

I'm glad I stuck with the peeled shrimp but again there was no hint of any Seasoning even after  squeezing lemon juice over them they were only eatable not good.  But since I was not going to order anything else.  I stuck with the shrimp.

The ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic.  The food is rather bland or just doesn't make you want more.",2
"The food here is ok. Very limited bar food ish menu. Really no sea food options which was surprising. Staff was friendly. The view from the deck is great, and the place is nice and clean and modern. I'd go back for the view or to have drinks, but the food menu was quite disappointing.",4
"My wife and I came both on Sunday for brunch and Monday night for dinner/drinks. Both experiences were great. First, the outdoor bar has an amazing view of the water (with heaters). Second, the service was fantastic. We were taken care of by different servers/bartenders, and all were fantastic.

Specifically, Danielle went above and beyond on her customer service. It is not common anymore to have conversations with bartenders at a lot of “popular” bars, but she not only took care of her customers, she talked to us like we were friends.

Highly recommend.",5
"I would rate this restaurant 0 stars if that were possible for the way we were treated by one of their staff.  Our first time coming here and this was a completely unacceptable experience.  We (three couples) went to the restaurant yesterday (Saturday) around 5pm.  There had been a significant storm that had just blown through and the restaurant did not appear incredibly busy.  We entered the bar area and asked the bartender if we could slide two - four top tables together for our group.  He said, ""yes, be my guest"".  A short time later, a server came to the table to took our drink order.  Shortly after that, a younger blond female came to our table and told us we could not stay there and claimed all the tables were reserved (over 3/4 of the tables were empty).  We explained to her we spoke with staff before sitting down and we had already ordered drinks.  We asked her to please speak with the server or manager because obviously there was an error somewhere.  We reiterated to her that we had already ordered drinks.  The younger blond female returned about 30 seconds later, advised us our drink order had been cancelled, the table we were sitting at was reserved and we needed to leave.  She then turned around, walked away from us as we were speaking and was last observed standing near the front hostess stand.  This young lady was unprofessional, lacked any amount of customer service skills and projected a very poor image of the restaurant.  Will we ever return?  Not sure because you just don't treat people that way.",1
"Amazing Drinks and food, great service Little bit of a wait, but worth it if have great company.,",5
"Great atmosphere and service! Don’t expect anything spectacular for food, but it’s definitely a top notch place to go hang out with friends.",4
"Flew into Tampa for the first time last weekend to look for places to live due to getting relocated there for work in a few weeks. I had to brag on our server JESSY H. she went above and beyond as soon as she knew we had a appt. in 45 minutes to get our drinks out right away, took our food order as brought it out with the check and boxes so we could be on time. She was so sweet, super friendly, and I will definitely be back because of her! Also we found a place close to the base thanks to you - deserves a raise if you ask me - THANK YOU ( :",5
"Had the house burger, great flavor and our server was on top of everything.",5
"I cannot speak for the nightlife however they do tout having a great chef.  Unfortunately twice now I have placed takeout orders which have been colossally wrong.  Not one item or side, but entire orders top to bottom with all food incorrect.  I patiently waited twice the time they quoted on a non busy night, Sunday, but to also get it wrong is pretty sad.  I cannot recommend this for anything culinary",1
Our waitress was great and the food was delicious 😋.  Service was prompt each time asking if we had everything we needed. She made recommendations and didn't get an attitude when we needed to send something back. I tipped her very nicely!!!,5
"Great food, service and location. Masks are require when walking in the restaurant or going to the restroom.  I liked that every table had hand sanitizer available. I had the Poke Tuna Tower and it was delicious!",5
"Food is great, but the service could be better. No one answers the phone for take out/delivery (called 3 different times today) and when someone finally answered they just hung up. Called again, no answer. Really wanted to order take out... I understand this place can get busy, but getting hung up on and not getting an answer was very disappointing.",2
Great place for after hours. It's open late and makes for a good destination after a game or event in Tampa,5
I literally ordered Buffalo chicken fries and they messed my ordered not once but twice and my fires were cold both times smh just how 😩🤦🏾‍♀️ soo disappointed,2
"I made a reservation 3 weeks in advance for my birthday for a party of 13, I was extremely excited since I had many friends coming into town for it. They made me wait about 30 minutes for my table and then sat me at a table that only fit 8 comfortably and told me they could at chairs.
I was extremely upset and expressed my concerns with the hostesses that were working that night and I explained that I don’t find the table practical for 13 people.
The hostesses went out of there way to get me a table with super comfy chairs by the water that ended up being able to fit 20! My experience turned around right away. The hostesses there were extremely caring and took the time to help make my birthday super special. I can’t remember their names but the two blondes deserve a raise.
What could have been a really bad birthday night, turned into one of my best birthdays ever.
The food was delicious, drinks were amazing. I will be coming back ❤️❤️❤️❤️",5
I loved It...I want more..we be are coming back with avenge.,5
"Made a reservation on Open Table for lunch. When we arrived, I asked the hostess to seat us close to the water, which he did with our dog. Yes, they are dog friendly. We had a attentive server, the main food was good, but the pretzel appetizer seemed as if it was soaked in butter. Would I recommend it, sure.",4
"I had an amazing time and met some cool people. I'll definitely come back. The music was everything, we was jamming.",5
"One of my favorite spots in Tampa! The food & atmosphere were AMAZING! I had the peel n eat shrimp, all the meats pizza, & chicken quesadillas (I know, I know! Lol 🤣🤦🏾‍♀️) Will definitely be back soon!",5
"If you're looking for the beautiful people of Tampa, this is a must stop.",5
"Lived on Harbour Island before this wonderful place existed. We even considered moving back😉. Well rounded,- delicious fare, beautiful sights and a warm happy buzz...seems to be the theme throughout.",5
"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. The food was excellent. The smoked wings were perfect. The pretzel appetizers with beer cheese went great with the large selection of beers. They had hard to find whiskeys, like Pappy or Blanton. The steak sammy was spot on along with everything else we ordered. The dessert was excellent. The service was exemplary. Unfortunately it was so loud from the music and radio people transmitting live, that it detracted from the entire experience. I don't want to yell at the table the entire time or continue asking everyone to repeat themselves. If this place could tone down the music, then it would have been a 5 star experience.",4
"shame there is no more happy hour for any food but I just had the best beer while travelling in the US
Kentucky bourbon ale if I remember correctly",5
"Went in for a meeting, not sure I'd go back. Food took incredibly long, service was meh at best. Might be a good spot for drinks....not for lunch",1
"Excellent food/service, especially from Stephanie 👍",5
This place is great. The food is really good. I get the AmSo Burger and it's so crazy good. Mac n Cheese isn't the best in town but it's still pretty good with braised short rib.,4
"Vibe is great, but I can assure you if you're older than 28 you will not agree. Hip, fun, party atmosphere with good food and drink. Awesome hangover recovery spot. Not for Karens and their ilk though.",5
"One of my favorite spots! Always a good time! Good food, good drinks and great views by the water!! Good Vibes Only...",5
"Great vibe, good music on the water, can't ask for anything better. Reservations suggested on weekends, gets really crowded...",5
"busy place,  too bad the waitress didn't understand the notion of a beer with ""salt and lime"". we'd probably go back if we had back to Tampa.",3
"Younger crowd,  nice views,  good location,  liked,.. burger, disliked..fries.",3
"I’ve been coming here for a while and love the atmosphere but recently, I was fortunate to meet a great hostess named Torianna. Torianna’s professionalism in a busy and fast paced environment was amazing!! I personally witnessed someone who had too much to drink speaking to her in a not very nice manner and during the whole interaction, this young  lady kept her poise and was calm. When I had a chance to speak with her, I complimented her and she seemed genuinely thankful and could not have been kinder or more helpful!! I don’t know what you’re paying this going lady but I would bet it’s not enough!! She is a true gem!!",5
"Love that they are cigar friendly, even have a cigar menu, plus..beautiful location💜",5
"Good food, great service, amazing location.",4
Great place to get a drink on the riverfront in Tampa. Spent a lot of time here while visiting from out of town. Great nighttime vibe on the weekend outside. Will definitely come back if in Tampa,5
Their pan seared salmon was delicious and service was great. I will definitely recommend them!,5
"Wonderful for a higher end American cuisine experience. Ribs, wings, and sandwiches are all great. Smoked Old Fashioned is top tier.",4
"Great food, great atmosphere and great music. All in all a good time.",5
"The atmosphere was really nice, Good musicand a good mixed crowd. I got the steak &fries. It was pretty good. I wish the chimichurri flavor was a bit stronger, but it was still tasty. My girlfriend got the all meats pizza. It was amazing!",4
Good food. Cool atmosphere. Huge outdoor bar and patio.,4
"Great place for cocktails, great atmosphere for sure",5
Lit time! Good bar staff and nice drinks👍🏽 peep the photo of me and James O’keefe. Also don’t be liberal,5
"Nice sea food and sushi. Awesome environment and an amazing service from the lady Ms. DEVIN and their mates!. Furthermore, the appetizers was outstanding. We have gotten an browny icecream",5
"Awesome location, right on the water.  Amazing, lively crowd with a well stocked bar and an full menu with tons of options. A tad over priced for what it is but that's okay. Food is passable but be prepared to wait if it is busy. Go for the scene and drink not the food.",3
Great food! Great vibe! Lots of people!,5
Very cool spot. Was there for a trade show so Very short and sweet visit,4
Great food and service!,5
"One of the most popular bar grill restaurants in Tampa Bay. Located next to waterfront and Tampa Convention Center. There is a dj station and two full bar station inside and outside by patio deck. It is a great place for crowded social bar and loud dj music. Very lively and pretty young people here. If you have a fun and good times, here is the place. You have to wait in line because there is always a line here.  Great staff and service. Decent food and excellent drink cocktail. Highly recommended.",4
An awesome place to pull up on your yacht and enjoy the awesome music and ok food,5
Came here for the Stanley Cup game stayed for the service. Anna took care of me the whole time and made sure I always had a drink on me. Great service and an a great vibe.,5
"Surprising great food for a sports bar, pork chop really tasty and  done beautifully.  The pretzel is a killer that would keep you eating so be careful!  Perfect spot for a big sports night.",4
Just discovered this gem. Great happy hour with a fantastic view.,5
Very noisy environment. Food was below average.  The service was very good though. Very nice waitress.,2
Very nice place. Atmosphere. View. Oysters 🦪 were a little small but it’s off season,5
"I highly recommend this place! The scenery is great, the food is fantastic and service is even better. Whitney was our server and handled our group flawlessly. She was easy to talk to and made sure all of our orders were correct. The food came out perfect and everyone had a great experience. Will definitely be back!",5
Went here Saturday and we had a reservation Saturday night for a friends birthday. The service was terrible and so is the food. First the waiter would barely stay long enough for us to put in orders and abruptly leave. I had to flag her down to put my order in. I’ve ordered here before for brunch and wasn’t pleased with the food. So I didn’t have much expectation of the food. But how the heck do you mess up a basic burger.  Also when they brought out the food they forgot one of my friends food because she never out the order in. Then when she gave us the checks she mixed them up and charged me for a drink I didn’t get. When I told her about it she said she moved over but it didn’t matter because it all cost the same. Which isn’t true considering I just got the mask burger and the other girl got tacos and a margarita. Moral of the story don’t come here for food or good service. Just a spot to hang and grab a drink from the bar.,1
Normally I enjoy the service here. I've been here on many occasions. But I brought my mom for her 62 bday dinner and shared with the waiter it was her bday but she didn't preset bday dessert for her untill we mention it to her. Also when food was brought out some of the meal was missing. The food was good just felt the service could have been better.,3
"We were seated inside and ignored for about thirty minutes. Not even a drink order was taken. Had to accost an employee and request a server. More waiting. Finally ordered and the food was decent although rather cold. No drink refills or appetizers were offered. Bill arrived and we departed without coffee, desserts, or after dinner drinks. Felt very unwelcome and regret spending my money here.",2
Burger was good but was a bit undercooked asked for medium photo included of how uncooked it was. They made me another and was ok. 15 for a burger but nice location wife loved the mushrooms. Music was a bit loud but to be expected at a bar resteraunt.,3
"Girls girls girls! Great Location right on the water, big patio, two outdoor bars and a very upscale interior. Relaxed attitude and lots of eye candy. Lines can be long on nice days and weekends.",5
Got ignored for 15 minutes then cut my mouth on 1 of 5 shards of glass in my drink. Then the bartender ignored me when I told him he should burn the ice.. I don’t make reviews often but wow worst experience in Tampa,1
"I’ve been coming to American Social for years and it just keeps getting better and better! The food and drinks are amazing and views are hard to beat in the Tampa Bay Area. The servers are very friendly and attentive, especially Kaili who has served me multiple times and goes above and beyond.

Will continue to return and bring my friends who visit here!",5
This is a very beautiful establishment with staff and scenery to match.,5
"Great views. Make a reservation, even for lunch.",5
"Only had the Caesar salad so can't really say great food but what I had was good.

One of the people in the party had sirloin that was good.",4
"Great new place! Yummy food, great service & gorgeous view. It's a win!",5
"Good food and drinks with massive indoor and outdoor seating areas.

This is a sports bar style restaurant with multiple TVs tuned into today’s sports event(s).  So, it’s loud and crowded especially on a hockey game night.

Good AMSO Burger and Strawberry Salmon Salad.  Good Pineapple Cider and Strawberry Lime Cider.",4
"The outside patio smells like dog.
#powerwash",2
Nice view! Decent wings and drinks. Good place to meet up with friends.,4
"Excellent place, I like that it's on the water and that you can pull a boat up to it. Great Night Life.",4
"Good food, good atmosphere, the ratio of beer cheese to pretzels is great that being said wish there were more pretzels.",4
"I want to thank manager Adam Perhosky for providing an exceptional venue, service and food for our 100 guests. I couldn't have asked for a better venue. I would highly recommend for any special occasion or corporate event.",5
"Last night was my first time at AMSO Tampa! I had such a great first experience! My server Aidan was amazing and extremely helpful. Food came out fast and tasted great, will be back.",5
"Views are beautiful, drinks were great so 2 stars for that. the food wasnt that good and service was absolutely horrible. After our order was taken our server Jennifer disappeared. We wanted to place another drink order waiting on our food but we could never see her. The BLAT chicken sandwich was grilled to death a few times. It was the driest chicken I have ever had in my life. It was seriously more dry than the bread. It took over 20 minutes for her to return our area and at this point multiple tables were waving her down because everyone was in need of something for the 30 minutes she was MIA. She brings the check and starts clearing plates after another 15 minutes (45 minutes since we received our food at this point). No reorder on drinks, never was close enough to tell her about the chicken. I mentioned it when she dropped the check off and she shrugged and said sorry. No offer to remake or even remove since it was not even eaten. We had already waited so long we just paid and left. Very disappointed for such a pricey place.",2
On Sunday night June 13 2021.  The waiter and the manager went above and beyond for our safety and comfort we experienced with an intoxicated person.  Thank you   And yes we went back today,5
Loved the atmosphere! The food and service were amazing.,5
Drinks are strong but the food is subpar to say the least. Definitely start with drinks first 😅,3
"Highly recommend American Social. Under Jason Thompson's management, the staff is on point & the service is great! Amazing place... day or night. Right on the water - beautiful views. Nightlife always solid 💯",5
"Great late night out fun, nice location to hang out with friends.",5
Beautiful outdoor seating! Good food. Fun vibe.,5
Terribly slow service music was so loud that we had to shout to talk to the person next to us. Ontop of the fact the music just sounded like a blown out speaker or the bass was to high and treble was to low.Guest assaulted me and no one did anything to her. Food was decent except my fries tasted like they sat in the fryer waaaaay to long.,1
If you strive for socialization and you are American...this is the place for you...I think. Idk I've never been.,5
A little on the pricey side but overall great experience at the same time. When I'm feeling fancy again I'm heading there.,5
went here for my 21st… food was decent but the dessert menu is definitely lacking. also is extremely loud music really necessary?,2
First time visiting and the atmosphere was amazing even tho it was raining. Really nice vibe next to the water. Nice views. Friendly staff. And they even had live music entertainment. Oh and the food was awesome too!! 10/10,5
Deviled eggs were good; ribeye sandwich not so much. The bread was soggy and the meat was more strip steak than anything else.,3
The steaks are amazing the tacos are mind-blowing amazing place to chill great vibe on the inlet came on vacation great place to eat five stars,5
Jessica was our server and she was amazing! So sweet and on top of everything. Food & drinks were delicious!!!! We recommend the froze! Will definitely be back :),5
Our Server Jessica made the experience great always got what we needed in an appropriate manner. Made the experience that much more enjoyable. Will definitely be back soon!,5
This place is a must visit for Tampa. Incredible view both day and night.,5
Love this place. Super fun vibe! Great drinks and food too. One of my favorite “swanky bars”,5
Came here for some lunch. The outdoor area was fairly busy and inside there was a great vibe. I sat down at a table and it was “super sticky”.   The food came out promptly and was a good portion for the price and good quality. The service was attentive especially since it was fairly busy.,4
"The service is good here, food is very good. I had the signature burger and I think it was one of the best I have had in a long time.
Outside atmosphere is great, good music and good times.",5
"Went here tonight and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and live music! We had a small problem with service, but the issue was quickly resolved and everything was fulfilled. Overall great spot with an amazing view. We will be back when we are back in town!",4
The view is magical 😃 watching the many colors of the sunset across the harbor.,5
What an incredible view! This place is massive with a little bit for everyone. We opted to dine outside. Tina was our server and she was so incredibly attentive. The GM made us feel welcome and greeted our table. The food was great. We walked inside after dinner and there was a DJ and people were dancing. This place is hopping with great vibes. We will definitely be back.,5
"Place was berserk! Awesome atmosphere and view! A Tampa staple! Friendly, up-beat, engaging staff! They rep our city well 🏙",5
"Bar tenders were on point with the pours, great service.",5
Good bar.  I didn't remember being here which is a good sign I had fun.,5
"Great servers!
Great food, great fun!",5
Food was great atmosphere was nice. Food got to us quickly even though they were very crowded the night that I went.,5
"Decent crowds and scenary, but the drinks are absolutely garbage. Loaded with alcohol and taste like gasoline.",3
Visiting a friend and stopped in to the bar with him. We ordered a couple of drinks. The shot had a good pour and the drinks are priced good for the location. I would have stuck around and seen what else is on the menu if I didn't have someplace to be.,5
My first time dining at the American Social. The food was very good and the staff was very friendly and professional!!,5
Great sushi and pina coladas with a mean Caribbean rum floater. I love this joint.,5
Great spot to hang out. The rope vieja tacos are phenomenal!,5
Great place with a beautiful atmosphere on the water.,5
"Great service and great food. Got the Buffalo chicken fries, and it was huge. It was very good, ask for extra jalapeños if you want it spicy. Got the horseradish burger. It was very good. I would've liked to see some more veggies on my burger. Way too much food for 1 person.",5
P.J.'s was impressive right off of the bat. And the Key West Crab Cakes are fire!,5
Food was great atmosphere was great service was great.  Each time I visit this resturant I'm not disappointed.,5
"Sat outside for a quick  lunch.  Lots of noise from fans.  I usually subtract a star for this as it tends to bother me a lot.   This time for some reason it didn't. The fans do keep it cooler. Food was decent, service also. Coffee was very good. A big plus.  Prices slightly above average.  Nice location on the waterfront.  Parking costs money.",5
Great bar and atmosphere. My favorite part of the night was DJ Camo playing great music all night long. Would definitely check this place out again when I am in Tampa.,5
"Great burgers, our waiter treated us well.",5
"So long story short we were visiting from out of town and needed a quick meal after traveling. We visited the Social and Lexi was our server. Despite how busy it was she was super personable, kind, and quick with service. Kudos to her for being awesome in this heat, with a mask on, and loads of people to wait on. The food was amazing. I recommend the mac and cheese  and Nashville hot chicken sandwich (surprisingly not hot and I'm sensitive). You will not go wrong here! Thanks, Lexi!",5
Came in last night after being treated so rudely at park and Rec and everything WAS AMAZING! thank you,5
Beautiful setting and great food!  No parking but Uber in for hassle free night,5
Great place for a private party,5
Great appetizers. A great variety of beers to select from on their menu. Great customer service as well .,5
"What a wonderful place for a relaxing date night. We sat outside, enjoyed the coolish Florida evening, and enjoyed the atmosphere. My hubs enjoyed his mule and I enjoyed me tiki tequila drink. We shared the shrimp small plate, then my hubs had the Nashville Hot sandwich (ask for more sauce on the side you'll be glad you did) and I had the blackened mahi sandwich. Also, if garlic fries are your thing, definitely pay the small upcharge for those with your sandwich, you won't regret it ☺️.",5
Ate brunch here Sunday. Atmosphere is great with awesome views. Music was a little loud but overall a great time and the food was very good.,5
Taco Tuesday is the best! Their spicy guava margarita is also DELICIOUS!,5
Great brunch and cocktails location! Love the view and the trendy atmosphere!,5
Best sweet potato fries ever. Come frequently lol….,5
Decent spot for large groups as their patio is amazing. Food....left little to be desired.,4
Always love this place. But they don't make sweet potato fries anymore. Those were the best fries ever!,5
"Jason at this Tampa location is AMAZING! He has such an amazing personality and no matter how busy it may be, he always goes above and beyond for his guest! The bar is amazing, the happy hours and the food but its people like Jason that makes me want to come back every time :)",5
"This is one of the best places to hang out, meet new people and just enjoy the atmosphere! Say hi to Sarah the next time you stop by!",5
Their drinks sneak up on ya! Parking garage is free first 2hours,5
"We had a party of 13 and 1 waitress who obviously needed help, some of the orders brought out we're wrong, and the food needs a little more flavor, it was very bland, but the drinks were good and the place was nice",3
Went to this restaurant a few weeks ago while i was down in Tampa. Sam was my waitress & made the experience unforgettable! Super sweet girl & made my friends & I feel so welcomed. The food was good & the view was beautiful. Definitely will be back in the summer next time i’m down in Tampa!,5
The bar and restaurant area outside has great views of Tampa Bay. This is a great hanging out place. Tried the Tijuana social and it was an interesting jalapeño infused drink. Also had some wings which were ok. At night you can see the colorful lights of the Tampa riverwalk.,5
"This was my first time visiting American Social, the food and drinks were amazing and the views of the water are fantastic. Did have to wait about 45 mins to get our food",5
"Not bad. Decently fast service for the struggles other places are having, brunch menu was very good....bloody mary, not so much. Paying for the location on the water more than anything else.",3
"We ordered take-out and everything was still very fresh and warm when we got it home. If you are ordering take-out from them, I suggest purchasing the Groupon.  It's a great deal. All of our food was tasty and the portion sizes were very generous.",5
Great PB&J Old Fashioned!,4
Nice place and good service. Steak was over cooked though,4
"the wife and i went for a quick bite but it was so live, that had drinks enjoyed the setting, music, and off course the food good",5
"The host, David, was INCREDIBLY HELPFUL, HOSPITABLE AND LOVELY. THANK YOU DAVID FOR YOUR WONDERFUL SERVICE. Made my experience so incredible",5
"Went for a private function.  Finger foos was meh, but what drove me crazy is this design that strips away any sound damping.   You could hardly hear yourself with so much echo.",3
Nice place but overcrowded slow service,3
Great food great customer service,4
Food was bad; seemed to be out of  Wal-Mart frozen food section.,1
Had a great time at American Social. Waitress was very knowledgeable and very cordial. Great view of the Bay. The food was very good. Definitely recommend it.,5
Always a great time and great food! Definitely worth a visit if you’re not from Tampa! I’m not a fan of chains but love this place.,5
Food that wants to be fancy but isn't. Very basic version chicken sandwich that had fancy description. Sister disappointed with lobster Benedict as it was over cooked.  Nice atmosphere and decor. Service was good as well.,3
Service and food is always good.  Ask for noelle she was awesome !!,5
"Bar was amazing!! Fantastic experience! Crystal and Justin  were super bartenders! Definitely ask for them.
And Jason made sure we felt right at home!❤️
This place place is definitely worth a visit.
And best happy hour in town tbh",5
What an amazing first time we had here! Tylo took care of us and gave us great service especially considering how busy it was. We will definitely be back and look forward to seeing her again:),5
The bartender referred to me as “Bubba” and said I would have to go to other side to get a beer.  The waitresses could only go here.  I told him my name wasn’t Bubba.  He finally took my order and aggressively put my change on the bar and slammed a glass on top of it.  I called and left two messages for the manager that never returned my call.  New to area but will offer my experience with everyone I meet.  Managers must not receive training now.  They must throw anyone they find in there.  I guess this place will rot from the top down.,1
The ownership is like none other. Great place. Definitely recommend.,5
Had their share platter.   The pork belly blew my mind.   This location in Tampa was much more tame than Ft. Lauderdale.  Solid atmosphere.,4
Mediocre overpriced food but the view and mimosas are great.,3
"Aldina was the best waitress that I’ve had as of recent. She has been extremely attentive to myself and my party providing above and beyond service, and also connecting with us on a personal level",5
"This place has great atmosphere, views, and service, but for the price I have had much better food. I was very disappointed.",3
Had a great lunch here. The AMSO burger is delicious! My daughter had a chicken quesadilla. She said it was very good as well. Emma was friendly and attentive. The manager Jason stopped by to check on us. He was nice too. Awesome place! Will be back for sure!!,5
"One of a kind, we had a blast..",5
We went to celebrate 4yo Averys' musical recital at Carlton Burgess School of Music. The server was attentive and our food was delish.,5
Great location. Priced fairly for the location. Younger college crowd mixed with older retirees and tourists. Food is good. Wouldn't write home about it or anything. Occasional live music makes it fun. This is really the spot for major events like the upcoming Gasparilla or for a quick bite and hanging out. Lots of TVs on the patio for sports. Overall just an average Florida spot that relys on location and view to get it past the mundane everything that it is.,3
"Fun place, amazing views and surprisingly good food 👌",4
"We booked the Tampa location of American Social for our rehearsal dinner for our wedding and had an amazing experience. The food was fantastic, the view was beautiful and the service was great. We worked with a man named Joshua and he made sure we were very well taken care of. I would highly commend this location and restaurant for any type of event dinner. 10/10!",5
Really solid food! Atmosphere is great and has a stunning view over the Tampa Bay.,5
Nice brunch experience.,4
Great place to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather with exceptional food and service,5
Good place to watch NFL on Sundays.,4
"Great area for day or night. Very good ambiance for birthdays or other gatherings as there are many spacious areas and private I door outdoor event rooms/bars. Nice selection of drinks, friendly staff and Food was delicious as well",5
Our waitress was wonderful... her name was Alyssa!!,5
"Food was actually really good. Deviled eggs, crab cakes,  and goat cheese croquettes stood out",4
Good times & chill place to hang out with a view. They usually always have a crowd & once they reach capacity good luck getting in. Everyone is nice but the bartenders could pay more attention to the customers especially since drinks are pricey. They always have the UFC fights on which is a plus.,4
Was in a party of 17.  Kids had to be at a separate table.  Not sure if waiter was new but he screwed up so many times.  One person in our group did not eat because the cook screwed it up twice.  Many did not finish their food because it wasn't good at all.,2
Extremely noisy. A place for a young crowd. Not family friendly,2
Loved it. Nice vibe. Food is very good.,5
Nice view friendly staff and the drinks are amazing,5
"Had brunch. Waited 45 minutes for food after we were seated and my order was Luke warm at best. Other than that, it is in a nice area and atmosphere was good.",2
"Great views, great view! No hurry. Loved it!
Yummy spinach dip and also soft pretzels. I will definitely return.
FYI- Be sure to have them validate your parking ticket!😀",5
Drinks are good but the food has been hit or miss. I had a really good brunch here but I went for dinner and was not as impressed. Can't beat the location and vibe though.,4
"First impression: i walked in and saw 2 beautiful hosts. They werent friendly, not rude, but very helpful. We sat at the bar. Our bartender Krystal was very very helpful. The margarita she made was amazing she definitely undersold it. This place is a little pricey but its expected in this area.

It also sits on the water so the outside is beautiful. Sorry I didnt upload the outdoor photos but tust me if you want to make an impression come here.",5
First time visit and it was great service and great food. I will visit again soon.,5
"This was my husband and I’s first time here and it was nothing short of an amazing experience. Brooke, our server was beyond attentive and so knowledgeable on the entire menu. We asked multiple questions and she was so quick to answer everything and still gave multiple recommendations on her favorite menu items. We ended up getting the mahi tacos and the steak frites based off her recommendations and we couldn’t of been happier. We will 100% be back because of of experience. If you go to American Social ask for Brooke!!!",5
"I ate here for lunch the day I arrived in Tampa. The food was delicious and the sweet potato fries were crispy. The meal was very filling for a decent price for the area. The restaurant also has a great view of the bay and very friendly staff. They almost messed up my order and gave me regular fries, but fixed it prior to me receiving it. This just delayed me getting my food.",5
The food is so good omg I love this place,5
Great views! One of my favorite paces 😍,5
American Social was an amazing experience! Beautiful view on the water with great food and excellent service!,5
"Nice place. Huge chicken, bacon, lettuce, avocado, tomato sandwich.",5
"Pretty place,  mediocre food, and female staff have everything hanging out. Maybe great for single guys grabbing a beer,  but not really appealing otherwise.",2
It was 1st time and I'll Definitely be back. Not only was the Food and Drinks🍷delicious but the atmosphere and views of Tampa Bay were beautiful ❤️.,5
"One of he best vibes in Tampa! A cool place to grab a drink, get some food or just hangout. Beautiful water scenery with the skyline in view and good music.",5
"If you can overlook the whole ""on the water downtown young trendy clientele thing"" this place is popular for a reason. Service was acceptable and quick despite being slammed. Brunch was delicious and the breakfast pizza was massive.",4
"Very nice spot to wind down after work....great food, great atmosphere, great view.....❤❤❤",5
Loved our whole experience we ordered appetizers and entrees and all of it was delicious. Our bartender Jason was awesome. And $3 mimosas are a huge plus,5
"This is a cool classy hang out spot. Valet, underground parking, for those who have boats, yachts,and jet skis can definitely pull up haha. We went Friday night, they had $4 margaritas, mix music but more so rave music. The late night view of the water is just an amazing scenery. I got the mahi mahi tacos, my first time having mahi tacos and was not disappointed.",5
"Clean, great food, atmosphere is fun and relaxed but still adheres to covid safety standards. Great outside view while you dine outdoors in shaded areas.Bring your dogs too
Very pet friendly. There's a reason the Lightning team celebrated here after their 2020 Stanley Cup win.",5
"Really good servers, fun ambiance, top American cuisine",5
Friendly staff. Delicious and tasty food.  First time going. Enjoyed the atmosphere.,5
Excellent  service by Hope....special dinner with family and my sons in the Army,5
Came here in a Friday night and it was fairly packed. Service is a little slow and food was...well it’s bar food so don’t expect greatness.,3
Great restaurant! Delicios food and amazing location right on the Hillsborough River! I highly recommend it 😃,5
Such a great vibe and amazing location! I recommend making a rsvp as they can get pretty packed. Prices are on the higher but food is huge and delicious. They have $3 mimosas on the weekends and often have DJ's. Definitely a must try!,5
One of the best places to go off the boat for dinner. Jason the bartender was amazing. He made the best espresso martini I have ever had . Thank you Jason for the amazing experiences of my life!!!!],5
"There on a Wednesday night.
Chill place to hang out. With friends. Great place with a view if you're on a date. Live music was loud enough that made it hard for servers to hear orders/ difficult for our table to have conversations.
Only had a few beers. Can't comment on the food, but it looked good.",3
Great place with an outstanding view! Definitely check this place out!,5
American Social is a wonderful restaurant. Waitress was very pleasant. Communications could be a little better concerning happy hour. Not everyone uses qr code to look at the menu with no prices. Management needs to work on that. Sounds like I'm but complaining but not. Great meal.,5
"First time there, around 3:30p.  Crowded but we were seated, informed the table was reserved for 5:30p.  That worked for us.  It was a lite menu.  Mahi tacos and Maple bourbon meatballs were ordered and both were delicious. Everyone walking around wore a mask.  Will go there again.",5
"Beautiful views. Waiter was very nice. Food was marginal but expensive. Limited options. Very, very young crowd.",3
Great food. Fast service.,4
If you like  big sports bars with a young clientele right on the harbor this is the place for you,5
"Great vibe, great view, great service, great food. I had the shrimp and arrugula salad. We started out at Ybor City and parked in a lot for 1:00 per hour. Then took the street car to convention center, walked over the bridge to Harbor Island, and enjoyed our dining experience. Afterwards, took streetcar back. There is a parking garage at harbor island, and the restaurant will validate so it's free for up to 2 hours while dining.",5
Amazing venue and food...it will always be a visifing spot whwn in Tampa from now on...,5
Attractive patrons served by a restaurant staff in chaos.,3
"Food could be better, so can service. View is amazing",3
What a wonderful experience...the happy hour is one of the best I've been to. And Justin and Crystal were amazing... also Jason was an amazing individual definitely recommend and will return most definitely.,5
Best Brunch in DT Tampa! Great staff and great atmosphere. Always bringing family and friends around for the experience because it is wonderful. If your late it’s your fault and they’ll give up the table but I wouldn’t wait for late ppl either 5 STAR ALL THE WAY!!!,5
"The waitress was kind of in a hurry, not a very pleasant experience. Donuts and biscuits were very good. The chicken sandwich could have had more taste and the drink should have been stronger. The ambience was nice.",3
"Always a fun time, drinks are good and great music. Love sunsets at this place :)",4
"Usually the food and atmosphere is pretty good but the last time I went last week, it took 15 minutes just to get our waters. The fries were cold and the burger was dry. Not sure what happened.",3
Jason in management is incredible and super helpful. Incredible experience and such a great time. Definitely coming here again due to the atmosphere and the great service.,5
this place is terribly overpriced and wayyy too crowded with raunchy looking clientele. the food at least was good. the best thing was hands down the spinach dip. it's hands down the best i've ever had honestly. definitely worth the buy. and our server was nice. she took a while but then again the place was super busy.,3
Day 1 stopped by and met Jason. He gave us amazing service.  Day 2 we came back per his reccomendation for the PBJ Old Fashioned. He made us a perfectly balanced drink that was to die for. Thanks Jason for making our trip more fun!,5
Love love the server Whitney she’s amazing my first experience was perfect she has a great personality and fun environment:) I will be back because of her! If you go here ask for this sweet hearts table because you will have a great time!,5
Food was amazing and that manage was on top of things.,5
"It’s our favorite place during the weekends usually weekend nights are busy but we don’t mind the staff is amazing and so is the quality of service.
Unfortunately that was not the case this past weekend.
Knowing  this is a weekend spot you’d figure a lot of drunk people. Hey it’s Tampa we get it......
But employees doing drugs in the bathroom is not a good look for the establishment.

Highly recommend re evaluating your staffs, especially  the ones that stick out visually like a sore thumb.",1
"What started out as a terrible workday turned into a magnificent send off party for our gal, Maris! We couldn’t have made it through our nights without Dakota! I mean not only were we thirsty but boy, did she quench us!! Handcrafted Skinny Dakota is what I was calling her drink. It was mind blowing and spine chilling. Mostly because it was strong, but still a tasty at the same time. My raving review isn’t only for the Handcrafted Skinny Dakota, but for the service of Dakota herself... if I could give a sixth star I would.",5
Great spot! Service and drinks were great,5
Great food and an amazing view,5
"Great location & view! The service at the inside bar was not the best & the food was was just ok. I honestly expected way more from this restaurant. I usually go to Jackson’s which is right next door & decided to change things up a bit. We ordered the Buffalo chicken fries, tacos & wings... the fries were cold & the wings never made it out to us in time so we ended up telling the bartender to cancel them. The ropa vieja tacos were the best out of everything. The brisket was seasoned to perfection! If I return to this location in the future, I’ll stick to ordering drinks.",2
"Delicious food, great drinks & great service! Give it a try",5
Great Event Space with accommodating staff. Can't say enough good things about how they handled a large group.,5
Great atmosphere & great food! Thanks to our waitress Whitney for great service!,5
"Good environment, very good service, good design, excellent view, good food, decent prices.
One of those places where the whole thing was a good experience.
Will go back.",4
"Drinks (whisky) always taste watered down, but the price is STRONG enough to instantly sober you! Location and atmosphere is GREAT though!

Update: Jason Thompson (general manager) cares about every customer experience. He reached out and made sure that I'd be a repeat customer.",4
"I have literally called this restaurant multiple times and no one has ever answered the phone. This is ridiculous! Attempting to book an event but I will take my business elsewhere.

*Yet again, another week of no answered phone calls!
This is ridiculous. Called event coordinator and front desk for take out, but nothing.",1
"Service was great for my wife and 2 kids, but I did not receive my dinner. They forgot to put in my order. Very disappointed for what I had heard. Although, they did cook it up later and offered it at no charge. This should never happen. Don’t recommend this place and won’t be back.",1
"Jason Thompson, the manger is super great. Made the super bowl great experience for everyone. He is super personal. We love American Social!",5
"Nice atmosphere, people and good food.",5
Fun spot! Food is great as well,5
"Best place to meet old friends, great food & drinks",5
This place was amazing. Although we did get there kinda late..,5
"I love going here for the nightlife! There's no cover, the music is good and it's always packed with friendly people! We usually stay mostly outside (especially now with the coronavirus) because the view of the water is amazing. Bar service is a little slow but we always go when there's a crowd so it's understandable. However, I was a bit disturbed that we didn't have to wear a mask at all and no one else was wearing them, especially with how crowded it was. Other than that I love the place",5
Lindsey’s service at the bar is second to none. Great food and quick bar service!! Cant beat it on the River Walk.,5
"Great place, good vibe, wings were excellent!",5
AmSo burger was one one of the best burgers I have had in a good while. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.,5
"American Social is a very cool place to watch sports, eat and have fun. The staff always treat you with a smile and great customer service.",5
"Fun atmosphere! The server/bartender I had "" Whitney "" Was very professional and fun! I would recommend. Thank you for the food and drinks!",5
This is the place where I always bring my parents when they visit Tampa. The vibe at American Social is always great! They make excellent drinks and they are always strong. Their food menu is delicious. I would recommend the Mac and Cheese with Steak or Grilled Chicken.,5
Wait time for a table was long and the service was slow but the food was great!,4
So me and my family came to the mall to have fun and we were starving and then we went here thinking it would be great but NO! We were sitting here for over an hour and then a family came and sit next to us and shortly after they got there food and we were still just sitting here left in the dust I only gave 2 stars for the flavor of the food,2
Went there for Taco Tuesday's (All you can eat. We had reservations for 8:15 and wasn’t seated till 9pm. I ordered one of each taco (They have four) The initial order took 45 min. Taco were dry and lacked flavor. I ordered 4 more Tacos which took well over an hour. They did give us a round of drinks for free and two drink tickets but the damage was already done. $14.95 for a total of six very dry tasteless tacos. Will not repeat.,3
"Great food, servings and atmosphere",5
"The waitress sucked. Took 15-20 min to bring an espresso and a sprite. It an hour and a half for our food to come out. Which, then had little to no flavor in it. We had to ask 3 people for salt and pepper when we sat down and we didn't get it until we were half way through our meal. We went to celebrate a friend's birthday and ended up very disappointed.",1
Waited almost 30 mins for a simple to-go order - cheeseburger and fries. Don't go here if pressed for time.,2
I had my 30th birthday here! We had a great time. Service was amazing and food was great!,5
"I went for the $5 buger special on Monday and it was pretty good. But normally it seems crazy  expensive, like $15 for a burger and $6 for fries hue.",5
"Brunch was delicious.  Great service, staff friendly.",5
The food was ok .drinks had to be returned some times . They weren't made right. . Im not knocking it. Its a nice place to chill . And the viewwS nice .. .but not to eat .,3
Ordered to go food and was so 😞. I hear the atmosphere is great tho.,3
Good food and the drinks were great!  Absolutely love the location and atmosphere.  Our server Whitney was on point...A+++,5
"Amazing!!! Loved this place first time going with friends it's next door to Jackson's. Now I'll be attending American Social the food and drinks 🍸were great along with the service loved, loved, loved it ❤😀😊",5
"The food is amazing!!  A little bit pricey, but the portions are huge!! Our waitress, Sarah, was Fantastic!!",5
Great service by Jameson. Mimosa's are amazing! AMSO burger is a much try for brunch.,5
"Service, Food, drinks, good!",5
"Nice place. The mac & cheese was fantastic. ( I liked the American Flag serving slab, too! The service started a little slow but it was our fault. We sat outside after walking up but it's best to check in with the hostess inside. Once we were say by the staff it was smooth sailing. The serloin looked good as did the AMSO burger. Great selection of brews, too! I will be back.",4
I'm so upset right now and I think a management needs to figure this out because this is false advertising and disappointing to your guests. I got off a nine hour flight just to want to have some good happy hour and before 11 pm the bartender Mike comes back from the kitchen to say the chef shut the kitchen down and then at 11:06pm they announce it on the speaker Sloppy business tonight June 30th on the menu it clearly says EVERY NIGHT 10:00 pm -close I heard Jordan the manager was supposed to come and speak with guests and I’ve sat here for 45 mins and he or she hasn’t even approached us however Mike made it extra extra worth it his customer service skills are amazing HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY,1
First time there @ the Downtown Tampa location and it was LIT!!!! Loved the vibe and the music!!! Drinks weren't bad neither.,5
"Great place, food and scenery.  Great customer service, but definitely not for the kid's at night. Lol.",4
Great atmosphere food I'd ok drinks are good,5
"If you're coming for the ""All you can eat"" tacos, expect to only get your money's worth over the course of the whole day. We gave up after only being served twice after two and a a half hours.",1
Great service! The deviled eggs app is amazing! The bacon really makes it pop! Also try the cucumber fizz cocktail. DELISH!,5
"I'd you're vegan don't go here. The service (waitress) was wonderful, but the kitchen takes forever top get your food out. They have no vegan option that isn't just a byond burger on a plate. There is no vegan bread and the fries they offer with it is fried in the same oil as the chicken wings and to change the fries for the brossel sprouts or the broccolini would be extra. So basically this place is telling you to go fick yourself if you're vegan.",1
"Was very crowded, slow service, rarely saw server, only take order, drop off food, then the bill.  Never followed up with checking on drinks.  Beautiful views of the channels, food was okay, not great.",2
"Nice place to go with friends, have a few drinks and dance...",5
Since we can't really enjoy the atmosphere the focus is now on the food. And the food was sub par... Especially for the price. My mom however enjoyed her salmon... My pork belly with BBQ guava sauce tasted like thick bacon drenched in guava jam. While my daughter's Mac and cheese was separating and looked like curdled milk. My waitress wore her mask on her chin as she dropped off our water and talked over the glasses as she put them on our table... I gave them two stars for the nice water views...,2
"Good food, nice view and great beer selection.",5
Awesome food and service,5
"Extremely long wait. Advised 15 mins, arrived at 15 mins waited another 20. Burger was tasty, but fries were way over salted. Staff was pleasant but always kitchen was overtaxed. I'll take a pass next time In Tampa.",3
Atmosphere was great.  Server Noelle was great. And Food was on point,5
This was very different from what I was expecting... cool ambiance and vibes,4
"I went to a birthday party,this place is awesome we used the private room and out the back door is the bar looking out over the Hillsborough River..I didn't try and food but the drinks were reasonable get ready to pay $15 for parking.",5
"Food was decent, but overpriced. Cigar smoking allowed outside, which was where our seats were. Then moved inside, but it floats in through open doors. So gross! Can't believe they allow this...we moved our seats twice trying to get away from it, to no avail!",2
Some of the bartenders are rude for no reason but atmosphere was okay,4
"The atmosphere is fun, the food is delicious and the drinks refreshing!",5
Great food and drinks. Artichoke & Spinach dip a must try!,5
Ari is amazing definitely the best most energetic ever! 11/10 recommend!,5
"Our server Jarvis was great.  However, our all you can eat tacos were not so much.  They didn't come with any of the toppings that were on the menu.  Jarvis accommodated us by bringing sauces and pico. Wish the chefs would have plated them as stated on the menu.",3
"The place is very nice, and the food was good.  Our server Jamison was fantastic.   .  The only thing I didn't like was the music too loud.  Between that and the masks it was difficult to communicate.
Definitely, I will be back and recommend around.",5
Very nice scenery and excellent customer service even though the bar was very busy. A++,5
Went for a friends birthday and after we paid for bottle service and food for our section we were forced out by the staff while not allowing the the person who we came for to at least take a shot for his birthday. I understand they closed the inside at midnight but there was another table right next to us and they were not asked to leave. Will not be returning  due to terrible customer service.,1
Food was great aswell as service,5
Outdoor bar and live music on water. Pricey but  good!,4
"Great restaurants, great food hands down!!",5
Place is kinda cool a little pricey for fru fru designer drinks.,4
Love this place. First time to the one Tampa. We at outside and enjoyed the river view. Once you finish eating and drinking take a walk along the river. Great live band and great food. Highly recommend.,5
"Don't order the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich unless you just want a chicken sandwich. It is a perfectly fine fried chicken sandwich and I wouldn't have bothered leaving a review if they just called it such. That said, I'd feel guilty if I never left a review and let people live their lives thinking that this sandwich is remotely similar to a Hot Chicken Sandwich. There is absolutely no spiciness at all in this sandwich, let alone the one of a kind spicy flavor that one finds in a Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich.",3
Another delicious experience at the American Social chain.  Great atmosphere outside with live music!,5
"Atmosphere, food, drink and service all very good!",4
"Very busy, staff tried hard to keep up, but service was a little slow.... Music outside from DJ inside WA base only so after a while it just induces a headache if you're sitting outside",4
Great atmosphere good food,5
Good food and great water view!,5
Short rib mac n cheese is amazing!!! And their espresso martini delicious 😋,4
Food was amazing and atmosphere was very rich and lively. Server Lexi is fantastic 👌,5
"Such a diverse crowd,great vibes and super spacious!",5
"Good music, great servers, food not so good!",3
Cobb salad 👍🏼,5
Greats Vibes! Awesome food. Must visit!,5
"Rude caucasian girl as hostess seemed mad about working , not my fault your a server, walked me to the wrong table assuming its because it was the only other black person reservation. Weak drinks. Mahi tacos had no salt pepper or flavor and bones in taco. First and last time in.",1
The buffet was pretty cold. The menu items are a much better choice,4
Food is very good. Brunch on Sundays is awesome.,5
Once in a lifetime experience.....,5
"Very good service, good upscale sports bar",4
A Staple in Tampa. Try and find a better view then their outdoor bar area in the Bay. Great craft cocktails and good food. It all comes at a price for this great dining experience.,5
"Pretty ambiance!  Right on the water! Food could have been better.  Burgers were not fresh beef, but well prepared.  Service was attentive.",5
Great food and girls are friendly.,4
"📣 very important 📣

If you want to eat delicious food and drink a cup of coffee under the sound of wonderful music with a piece of delicious cake, then you, my friend, are in the right place, to be happy and enjoy the rest of your day.

What a great place. Food was great. Service was spot on,5
"The food and drinks are amazing and the service is awesome, they treat you well.",5
Love American Social! The staff is awesome & extra shout out to Jason! 😄,5
Food and drinks are always good. Has a great vibe too.,5
"Good service, great location. Drinks are above average pricing",4
"First off Krystal makes the best Margaritas, so attentive, making sure everything is cleaned and sanitized. Ava and Alysha are the sweetest and made the whole experience so fun. The menu has changed a lot in a good way and I can’t wait to go back.",5
"""What about Corona virus?"" is what I asked myself when I came here. Halloween was packed but it was mostly younger people who shouldn't be worried about it that much. Great music and vibe.",5
"My first visit and we were very impressed! Pretzels and deviled eggs were amazing. Burger was also great and I love the garlic parmesan fries. Great view, too! Sunset perfection.",5
"Fun place right on the water with great views of  downtown Tampa. Good food and drinks, great staff!",5
great dining experience and the salmon was amazing,5
Poor service and food quality was mediocre.  . .,2
We had a great time producing the LUXE Lingerie Show for Super Bowl Weekend. The staff and management were very professional and a pleasure to work with.,5
"Were excited to visit as we heard this place spoken highly of. Unfortunately our visit fell quite short of the hype..
Complete disrespect to patrons during visit on Sept 20, 2020. Was seated at a table outside, later to find out we would be part of a “promotional” video. No initial notification was provided that this would occur, no consent on our part was given. Instead, with the arrival of our food, we were greeted by an obnoxious film crew and their camera straight in our faces as we attempted to enough our meal. This proceeded even after deliberately asking to be moved. Upon speaking with manager on site, he claimed to have no part in it, did not know it was occurring. Unprofessional response for a disrespectful establishment. Add to that, the food was nothing special. Overall, in disbelief at how disrespectful management was.",1
The staff at the bar is a big wow..,5
Nice good costumer service,5
Amazing atmosphere.  The food was awesome and the service was spot on. It's a great place for a Saturday night. Had a blast.,5
This establishment had great food when I visited. They also had a great view of the water and an amazing outdoor life.,5
Amazing atmosphere.,5
Very nice! Love the avocado toast!,5
Great food and atmosphere. Will be back in June,5
Kaili was a great server last weekend. When the rain started she made sure we were dry and the service was amazing! Thank you can’t wait to go back!,5
"Good drinks, good vibes, great view of the water and the Convention Center!",4
"Good food, large portions which match the price, plenty of parking..plan to pay about $15if you stay a few hours, the atmosphere was upbeat and lively, bar tender was on point with drinks. I saw only one hand sanitizer station and hardly anyone had on a mask but the staff",4
Not bad...good atmosphere; good times.,5
Great food and ambiance.,5
Cool place. Nice open outdoor dining and a bar by the waterfront. Good food and drinks.,5
"Great food and atmosphere, just a bit slow bringing out the food.",4
"This place was amazing, great food  and drinks, our Server Tina was the absolute best and on top of everything. very clean and sanitary, great views on the water beautiful sunset. i will definitely be coming back..",5
Great time,5
Just visited this place for the first time tonight for an event and I'm definitely impressed. Nice layout. Nice views. Every staff member I interacted with was an absolute pleasure. Had 3 different appetizers from the happy hour menu and the food was fantastic.,5
"I love Amso!  It’s a bit of a drive from where I live in Saint Pete, but it’s always worth it! Great food and atmosphere along with the best server ever, Tina! She’s someone who makes a huge difference when we go and our experience is always top notch with her. 5stars for Tina too!",5
Wonderful food and drinks! Will definitely be going back again!,5
fun but extremely overpriced.,3
This is a great place if you want a good view of the river,5
"They have several vegetarian options and overall the food and drinks are stellar! This is a great atmosphere similar to a sports bar and great for casual conversation with friends and family. Great atmosphere, lovely food, right on the water. The only other feedback would be that the speed of service could be improved but otherwise it's excellent. I would recommend to friends and family and see myself coming back again!",5
Hostesses are clueless.  My takeout order took over an hour.,1
"Everyone talks;  the first impression is the one that remains and my impression was horrible.  Super, super, super disorganized the reception of customers (at 8:00 pm), the girls let some people skip the line and do not serve customers well.  The owner is lucky to be well located, as the dissatisfaction in the waiting line was general and everyone had the same complaint.  Open your proprietary eye !!!!",1
"Great food, amazing staff and a perfect waterfront view. A must visit in Tampa.",5
"The previous time I went the chicken tenders where great and the breading was amazing. This time the chicken tenders where disgusting and the breading was different, it was almost as if they where frozen and put into a microwave. I also bought a steak sandwich which half of it was thick rubbery it seems like the trimmings from a steak not an actual steak. Definitely not going again.",1
Shawn Robinson is the best server here !,5
"This is a cool spot on the water in Tampa that offers great spaces for people to gather. Meeting friends, sipping on special cocktails and eating delicious food is what this place is all about. The live music was a nice touch too. I had a prickly pear mojito, peel and eat shrimp, the tuna tower and the garlic parmesan fries with truffle aioli sauce. Everything was so good. My friends and I can't wait to go back soon!",5
New trendy spot. Good vibes. Awesome location.,5
The food and atmosphere were great,5
I do not want to hurt their rating but should have selected 2 Stars. I have been a big fan of the restaurant. It is a fun neighborhood bar.   I ordered their American Social Burger on Saturday for take out and it was a waste of money.  The meat was tough and looked like they stopped by Wendy’s and picked up an extra patty.  I still get cold chills thinking about it.,3
Great food! Very cool vibe right on the water. The staff and bartenders were great! Highly recommended!,5
"Party of 3, looking forward to trying American Social for Brunch, as we are exploring eateries in the Riverwalk area. We had inside reservations on a Sunday @ 1145.  We arrived a few minutes early , and were seated promptly . Waited a very long time before a server acknowledged us , or took our orders. Food was OK , probably would have enjoyed more if service had been prompt or attentive.The restaurant was not very busy when we were originally seated, but while we were waiting , patrons began to come in, and we still didn't have drink orders taken . Server still got generous tip.  Although the setting was nice, not  likely to be a return customer.",2
"We were invited by our friend to join a vip table for New Year’s Eve. We arrived at around 1130pm.  When we arrived at our table we received our champagne and enjoyed the fireworks very much. Quite beautiful, but past that everything involving the service was some of the worst Ive ever been apart of. We weren’t given cups for our drinks for over an hour with the server telling us “there were none” when my girlfriend got tired of waiting and went to the bar to get a stack. We had our alcohol and mixers with nothing to drink them in for the table. I feel I was getting better service at times as I was ordering shots that were a separate bill at the time. I honestly feel bad my friend paid so much for a really non-vip experience. I personally can’t recommend a place that doesn’t treat vips like vips. If you go expect to be given your bottles and left alone past that for the most part. I understand it was New Years but when someone puts down thousands of dollars i feel they should be wined and dined by the establishment and we all didn’t feel like that there.

Edit 1- upgraded to 4 stars now-  I spoke with management and I have to say I appreciate the great service that was given in the conversation. Owning up to anything is hard sometimes and Jason was honest and open about the situation. It was beyond busy that night and I can understand missing the mark, getting a win in service with every table.
I won’t go into further details out of respect for the personal conversation, but I can say Jason was very complimentary in trying to make up for the night. I will be coming to American social for dinner (never been) and will update my review accordingly.",4
"Showed up, 3 hostesses ignored the line forming, had no idea what tables were available. Took about 15 minutes for us to decide to leave",2
Amazing food and atmosphere. The music is extremely loud though.,5
Great people good times,5
"Guava Pork Belly, so delicious!",5
It was ok. The food was good though the service was slow. We were there for an hour and still had to wait for our food to arrive. The presentation’s nice though. I’d say look elsewhere.,3
"Food was really good. Waitress was great but food took forever (not waitress' fault)
Would go again.",4
"Went here for a private event and best food I have ever had for a, company party. Not even kidding. John, the manager was very pleasant and rolled down the plastic siding to help with the cold. Bartenders were great (boo FSU though :)) and the heat towers were placed in good spots. Would love to come back on a date or anniversary.",5
Great place and the food is tasty and isn't expensive. They have great margaritas as well. Only thing is it tends to get busy and there is a wait sometimes but I highly recommend this place.,5
"American Social has the best views, service, and food! It’s our favorite place to get brunch. The staff is extremely helpful to fix any issues.",5
Good dining experience. Host stand is a hot mess.,4
"Their brunch atmosphere is one of my favorites ! Great food and ladies AYCD free with the purchase of an entree, you literally can't beat that ! they also have a good happy hour menu that features delicious oysters. The only thing I miss is they took my favorite chicken and waffles off the menu. It used to come with a fresh strawberry spread on top. they fixed something that wasn't broken ! very sad about that, but other than that ! this is a great place to enjoy a Saturday brunch with your friends.",5
"Service is never really that great anytime I come here but it’s right off the water and the food & drinks are decent. If you can get over the frat boy vibes and want to watch a game when it’s a nice day out, give it a try! Also don’t forget to validate your parking with the hosts.",3
"Originally, my review was a 2. The manager reached out and inquired why.   I felt the food mediocre and rhe service was very slow due to staffing.  However, the manager offered a refund which he followed through on and he said he would send us a a gift card to return to try them agian.",5
Went for Saturday brunch. Great food service and atmosphere!,5
"We went for brunch. It was a good choice of food, omelets, bacon, home fries, homemade sausage patties,..... Excellent selection. Our waitress was Asia- we cant say enough good things about her! Friendly, adorable, and very attentive! We had a group of 6, we stayed for about 3 hours. She didn't rush us out. They had bottomless mimosas for $20.00, & bottomless Bloody Mary's for $30.00. The place is very nice, a little too fancy for me :) People watching at its finest and the validate parking at the hostess stand. I will be going back!",5
"Welcomed visitors to Florida and had a great experience by the river. The drinks, live music and atmosphere was great! I can't wait to check out Thursday's ladies night! Jason took great care of us and he was a PACKERS fan!",5
Beautiful hacht outside American Social Restaurant with my Daughter's Name,5
"Great spot for an outdoor dinner and drinks.  The outer bar and tables allow you to watch the water between Harbor and Davis Islands and the Tampa Convention Center.  The happy hour prices are great, and their burgers are fantastic.  Monday's the burgers are only $5 during happy hour, and beer $7 and under are half price.  You can get a great meal for just a few dollars and watch the sun go down.  Great place, I'll be back.",4
Long wait for average food. Waitress was new and did good,3
"Went for brunch and was not impressed. I had the Maine lobster Benedict and it was very minimal for the price. There wasn't a lot of lobster, only 2 pieces and the hollandaise sauce was diluted with so much lemon juice that's all you tasted, thankfully there wasn't very much of that either. Not worth the price though it did taste good. Beautiful view so I'd recommend drinks but do happy hour. Prices aren't worth the food or drinks.",2
The view was amazing... mahi nahi tacos are GREAT... also had the Nashville chicken sandwich. I was expecting a saucier sandwich but it was food for what it was worth,4
The music is way too loud to have a conversation and it's awful music on top of that.,3
Just awesome,5
Great vibe! Great food! Great mimosas!,5
Ordered the All The Meats Pizza 🍕.  👍👍,5
"It was cute, didn't really think it was any special, overpriced overpriced but it was packed. The bartending staff was excellent.",4
"Great food, service and live music! Sat at the bar on the patio, Devin made great drinks and was amazing.. coming back tomorrow!",5
Had a great Taco Tuesday lunch today!  Tina was a gem and recommended my food and drinks which I absolutely loved! 💕,5
"Nice atmosphere, but food wasn't all that good.",2
"Nice location on the water with great views. The signature burger at $17.95 was underwhelming. The bacon was thick but not crispy. The burger was not moist or juicy. The fries were not crispy, limp and room temperature.
The beer was just a little colder than room temperature.
The service was a highpoint and was prompt, efficient and professional.
If you come here, I recommend having a simple cocktail on the rocks, skip the food and enjoy the waterfront view.
Bottom line - great venue with sub standard cuisine.",3
Sports bar in Tampa downtown with beautiful view. Staff was friendly. Good food. Cocktails were not upto the mark.,5
"A few friends and I  went in to have a few drinks and eat some oysters  for my friends birthday. My friend didn’t realize it was only raw oysters so we decided to just have a round of drinks and close out. We received our drinks after paying and they were honestly terrible. I could see the bar and watched as the bartender poured them and she didn’t use a jigger, only freehand. They tasted like pure sour mix and were green because of it. I asked the waitress if we could please have another shot to just throw in to offset it and if she could bring her manager so she didn’t have to deal with it. She returns, no manager and said we would have to pay for the shots. We spent 38 dollars on drinks that we took a few sips from and left almost full because they were undrinkable. For the manager to not come out at the request of a customer is rude and it’s even worse to not fix an issue a guest is having, especially one so simple as two drinks. It was my first time there and was really unfortunate to be treated that way.",1
Was later in the evening with plenty of people still in the establishment last night. I had asked the heavyset bartender if I could have please have a water for a headache. She proceeded to ask if I had a tab in which I didn’t because I close out with every drink. I responded by telling her “no I don’t” in which she replied “we’re closed” and waddled away with a snarly attitude. Management really needs to just let these types of people go. Terrible business tactic considering I had already spent over $150 on drinks!! Didn’t know I was supposed to tip her more just for a water 😢,1
"Great place to gather to watch a game, servicer was on top of it Surprised at the food pricing and amount you get for the money. Definitely recommend and will go back",5
Definitely a nice view of the river and the city. Good music and a nice vibe.,4
Great food and Staff,5
Hire some more bartenders. Terrible service,1
Garbage service. The security guards seated us before the hostess could.,2
Great food and drinks. Service was perfect even with a big group. Thanks to Ari!! Excited for my next trip to Tampa and AMSO.,5
Nice food!,5
"Great atmosphere, great service and the food was delicious! I’m vegan so the fact that they had a dish for me was amazing! Love the chill vibe every time I come out! We always sit by the water and listen to the live music at night.",5
Good food great atmosphere,5
Amazingggg food & drinks & music  !! Young crowds only😈,5
"Tina was our server.. she is the nicest and always checks in on the table!!! Love coming here and having her as our server, she makes the atmosphere so fun!! We will be here every weekend for the Caesar salads!",5
"Fun place, good location, beautiful people, good burger, and best staff...reasonable too.",5
Good times but a little pricier than I realized. 3 casamigos shots came to 39 bucks and imported beers are expensive. There's a certain element of greed that I don't appreciate but hey it's a tourist spot. Still cheaper than west Hollywood I guess,4
"Great place, Delicious Food but sticky tables!",4
Hope was the best!!! Coming back for her,5
"Staff is great

Daytime or nightlife Fantastic establishment.
Management conscience, Great place to enjoy the day.

Owners are great as well",5
Great service. Food was very good. The waitresses are beautiful.,5
Had a nice meal,5
"Solid food, good views, good atmosphere, good drinks!",5
"I arrived there on the opening weekend for an 8 PM reservation for 15 girls to celebrate my best friends birthday. The hostess said she did not have any such reservation. I was totally stressed out and then realized we had accidentally made the reservation for the American social in Miami. (My mistake!)They immediately asked Adam , Director of marketing, to help me out. As I stood there waiting, I became more and more nervous because I overheard there is an over a two hour wait to be seated outside. Adam was amazing! He was able to arrange a VIP table for 15 girls in under 25 minutes on a busy Saturday night! The wait staff was friendly and helpful. Drinks were great and food was yummy. Adam was extremely attentive to make sure we were taken care of. He even personally brought out the birthday cake, scrambling to re-light the candles over and over again on a windy evening. I cannot tell you how grateful I was for Adams timely and over-the-top assistance. He saved the day and made my friend's birthday memorable.",5
"We had our Holiday/Christmas Party on 12/13/2018 at American Social and we had a wonderful time. I kind of left this whole scheduling thing for the last minute, but Carla, the Marketing & Events Manager, was amazing and still were able to get us a perfect private room. She was so proactive and responsive and together with our servers Mike and  Joshua they provide us a perfect time. Rent It Network team really appreciate that. Thank you.",5
Nice large outside area with good views of the water.,4
Great place to hang out with awesome view,5
If you come here make sure aldina is your server. You will get the best service ever.,5
Great place for drinks and bar food,5
Anna was incredibly attentive and so HOT!! 5 stars for the atmosphere and service!!,5
"Great location on the water on Harbour Island overlooking downtown Tampa. Despite being one of the largest bars / restaurants in Tampa the service is generally fast and efficient and the atmosphere is excellent. Cocktail choices are endless and they have a good selection of beers and wines. As a sports bar there are TV’s everywhere and the managers are very accommodating to allow you to watch your favorite teams. Food choices are good for a bar and the lunch specials are reasonably priced and quick. It has many “lives”, from the corporate lunch crowd to the typical happy hour crowd, dinner crowd, and then the late night club crowd on weekends. Very happy that this place exists.",5
Wings were severely undercooked and the tacos on taco Tuesday were boring!,1
Always a great time,5
"Love this place! Great food and drinks. I've been here several times and have always had a great experience. Service is top notch too! Go to the bar and ask for Alyssa, she's the best!",5
ALDINA WAS AMAZING AFFFFF SHES SO COOL AND AN AMAZING SERVER I HOPE SHE GETS A PROMOTION🥺💙,5
"Service was really good 👍.  The food was good, a bit pricey and long wait in line to get in.",4
Pork Chop was ok after I finished cooking it for them.,3
Waitress in the outside room kicked us out for not ordering fast enough and threatened to bring security if we didn’t leave. No objections or asking just went right to “I’ll get security”. This is a true 1 star experience for poor customer service. Funny thing is we did order a drink and were waiting for the fights. Oh well won’t come here to recommend ever.,1
"I’ve been several times for brunch and dinner, always delicious! The ambiance is fantastic, fun, vibrant! The views of the bay can’t be beat, perfect for a Sunday funday. The restaurant is on harbor island so difficult for parking, make sure to get your parking validated before leaving.
My favorite part is their drink selection. They have a good cocktail menu but and outstanding liquor/ wine menu! From rare whiskeys/bourbons to premium scotches; delicious rums and quintessential tequilas- this selection can’t be beat! They also have an excellent selection of wines at a very good price. For me, there’s nothing more important than having the options of a good drink.
The food is also great. The Oysters and Mac and cheese are my favorites. They also have gluten free options which is important for my family.
I will definitely keep going back bringing all my friends and family.",5
I always come here to get their fifth and lavender cocktail it is amazing from presentation to taste. Tina was my server and she gave me excellent service and greeted me with a great smile.,5
Fun..great food..great location..,5
Can never get someone on the phone,1
Stopped in for Downtown Wednesdays and it was a great experience. Emily S. was a stellar and super sweet server. We had the $10 bottle of wine and $10 pizza for Downtown Wednesday special and it was delicious!!! The pizza was enough for two.,5
Great atmosphere and really good food. Highly recommend.,5
"Phenomenal peel and eat shrimp, wings and brunch burger was a lovely mess (ask for extra napkins!). The mimosa special was great too. Service was somewhat slow but very friendly.",4
Very cool and trendy river front bar and grill. Was there with busniess associates who all had a great time. The food was good but a bit high priced. Would have been a 5 star except that a DJ came in at 8:30 and the volume was equal to that of a nightclub. The wait staff was great and very attentive.,4
"Boring, should  have gone anywhere else. Food was lackluster. Staff was friendly. Margarita was very weak. Bathroom was clean.",2
Very nice and peaceful with a beautiful scenery and a mahi-mahi tacos was great...,4
The vibe continues to be consistent so that's a plus.the minus way to crowded at the bar with unmasked ppl,4
"The manager was very helpful to us on seating us on a table we enjoyed the view a lot.

Thank to him",5
Wonderful food great atmosphere.,5
"Amazing lunch!  Beautiful views, excellent food and our waitress Stephanie was phenomenal!",5
Really great place. Me and my wife went during happy hour on a Monday so we got the burgers and she got the $4 margs. She said the margs were good. I tried to get a local craft beer but they were unfortunately out so I had to settle for a non happy hour drink. Prices were reasonable for a downtown big city. Atmosphere was nice. Burgers were delicious,4
I had a great time at our friend Emma’s birthday brunch! This place is beautiful. The service was excellent and the food was delicious!,5
Good vibes and good music!,5
Ordered the peanut butter jelly time drink with peanut butter whiskey. Too sweet for me but would be great to take as a shot. Otherwise the ambience and location on the bay is awesome.,5
I ordered pork belly it was terrible not seasoned we ordered ribs it was terrible to i am not going back wasted my money,1
Most excellent service.,5
"Typical social with typical expensive pricing. Nothing to write home about at all.  Drinks are alright, but the food is horrible.  Good place to do events or gather with a large group of friends, but aside from that, nothing to write home about.  Parking is expensive on top of that.  It wouldn't be bad if the service and quality of food/drink was there, but it's not.  You're essentially paying just to say you went to American Social, when other places will do the job so much better for so much cheaper.",2
"Food was Awesome
Service was OK
Views are Amazing",4
"What a great place. I stopped here in between meetings today and Billy was the bartender that waited on me. Made an awesome Blueberry cocktail...recommended a great lunch rush meal, friendly. It got busy and everybody seemed to be having a great time on a Thursday lunch. I will definitely be back and bringing my clients here in the future!!! Thanks :-)",5
Good food.,4
"Food was awesome fresh, flavorful, and cooked very well, alchol drinks were on the spot and a perfect spot to go to watch a game!!",5
"Girls who weren't even from the same group were in crocs during their ""club"" hours so their dress attire is super lenient and honestly takes away from the experience for me. I really liked it when they first opened and everyone came to impress. The inside and outside bar charged me a different price for the same exact drink too. Still good music and no cover though so at least that hasn't changed.",3
Just an awesome place with great atmosphere,5
Great menu for food and drink. Bartenders are fun and friendly. Love to atmosphere,4
Very nice place to eat and hang out with family and friends 😊,5
The bar and grill located in downtown Tampa near the convention center. It's handy if you need to grab a bite before the hockey game over in a Molina marine or any concert playing there. Do be aware that parking is very limited. They do have a parking deck but the cost is $5 per hour so be prepared to Shell out some money for parking if you want secured save parking. They have a wonderful happy hour menu they usually run $6 and half off of wine and alcohols.,4
"Came in at brunch hours, Sunday. Food was great, service was great. We asked to be seated in the sofas outside if possible, place was packed and we were seated in 5minutes. Food time from order to be in our table was minimal. Drinks were cold. Will definitely come back.",5
"Visited Feb. 18, Saturday, 5PM. Six adults. Placed order three times because three items ordered where out of stock. Waitress knew very little about  menu when ask questions. She did not know items out of stock. Waited long time for food and one order was missing item. Took additional 20 minutes to get item. Prices are high for food and drink. Food quality was terrible. Barbecue chicken was cremated. Probably cook hours earlier. Three of six meals where less than satisfactory.
Visited for lunch about three weeks ago and it was great. Dinner however had a terrible waitress and poor quality food. Will not go for dinner again. The atmosphere is awesome.",1
All the food extremely well cooked.. Service was good even though we had over 20 people. The view is super cool 😎.. Totally recommend,5
"Great spot, right on the bay. Fine selction of craft beers. Excellent service.",5
"I called this place at 11:30 to make a reservation. However, the lady over the phone said they weren’t taking anymore more reservations (which I can understand) and then follow up saying that they were taking walkings. I then say I would be there within the next 30 minutes to confirm nothing would change. After a 30 minutes drive I get in line to be told “that no more walkings will be taken and the only option was to sit at the bar...”",1
Better than Jackson's,5
Great staff.  Welcomed with a smile from hostess.  Welcomed by a bartender with a freaking awesome mustache.  Immediately was given water and menus.  Me and my friend were walked through the happy hour and favorite meals by Joseph.  Great balanced cocktails and good steak.  Oysters were above average.  Definitely coming back.,5
Great club like setting downtown in the evening.,5
My food was salty and expensive. The place is over rated if you ask me,2
"The best quesadilla I have ever had! Our service was amazing, we were served by the lovely Tina and will definitely be returning!",5
"Great waterfront restaurant and sports bar w beautiful view of Downtown Tampa Skyline, boats, and a great happy hour!",5
"Great service, nice atmosphere, and excellent food. I recommend the spicy chicken sandwich. Lol",5
Cool views out back. Great food.,5
"Great views but horrible food! Bartenders were amazing and polite. Very informative and helpful for being new to the area. Ordered food during happy hour but it was not good at all. Buffalo wings didn’t taste like buffalo AT ALL!!! Pretzel bites with cheese, the cheese tasted moldy and was clumpy. Prices were reasonable great. Recommend for drinks and social but not for food. Bar smelled like old beer and the cigarette was a step down from a strip club.",3
"Great ambiance. Very friendly staff, good service. Got a bit of a run around to get a table outside and ended up going to the place next door for sushi. They stated when they first opened they didn't accept reservations for the tables, yet an hour later when I asked for a table they said they were reserved.",4
"Excellent attention, unique taste and special thanks to Chef Freddy Figuera for his recommendation.
Five stars and beyond.",5
"Best atmosphere in Tampa but food is average at best. Really need the food to match the physical location.  Turning into a bar first type place . Entrance and host stand placement are really bad, not inviting or warming, you walk right into a small door with a podium 2 feet away and honestly no welcoming greeting. Been 3x, feels like they could do a lot better, like another South Tampa spot that's hot right now resting on it's laurels... Been around long enough to know how that usually ends up. Hope they tighten up because it's super a super cool spot.",3
The outdoor bar is probably one of the best spots to spend a beautiful day.,5
"Really enjoyed the vibe, smooth and the mahi-mahi tacos are very good.",5
Oh goodness I had such a great time and bumped into so many familiar faces at American Social the other night. The music was awesome. The cleanliness was up to par. The team of staff they put together is great and the vibe was enjoyable. Glad I checked it out.,4
Went here for after work drinks and it has a great atmosphere. It's right by the city walk and has great views of the water and city. The menu is small but everything we tried was great. The drinks were on point as well. We will definitely go back,4
"I went there to have dinner and a couple drinks after work. The steak frites was absolutely amazing, and their smoked old fashioned are definitely out of this world. Dylan was my server and he made sure our evening was spectacular. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for great food, great drinks with and even better view of Tampa.",5
the service was terrible and were waiting for 2 hours and there was 18 tables empty . They said it was all reserved.,1
"Great atmosphere, clean and great service, David and Leilani really took care of our birthday celebration,,,,",5
"Great place to go for a great dinner,or if you're just having drinks. They allow smoking outside at a very nice bar or chairs. The staff is awesome! They seen that the sun was very bright and they literally came over and put a shade up infront of me and other customers. You do need to wait to be seated but you don't wait long. They definitely have enough room for everyone and this is a great place to pull up to from the dock on the Hilsborough river.",5
Great crowd,4
"Beautiful place with attentive staff. Food and drinks were very good. They only opened a week ago so surely there are organizational issues. Kind of funny to see people smash them with 1 star during their first week of operation. Some people just can’t be pleased. I would avoid Friday and Saturday nights for now because they aren’t ready for the crowds, but try it any other time for a nice afternoon or night out.",4
Had a great time. Service was excellent and they had excellent live music - The Skylar Clark band. Will definitely be back.,5
"American Social has beautiful and peaceful views overlooking the Tampa bay area downtown. Service was good & good selection of food. Easy to walk to from hotels & other downtown venues. Good place to sit down and talk with friends, family and eat.",4
Nice staff. Good food.,5
"Came here after the George Lopez comedy show. It was late and we were quite hungry. Found a seat at the bar and the bartender told us they were not serving food at the time, but he made sure and went through hoops to get the cooks to make us something even though they were closing. My 2nd time here and would definitely recommend.",5
"Pretty nice space --- though a little bland and Tommy Hilfiger-y --- good beer selection, a fair number of pretty people, and an outside patio bar with good views of the harbor. Pretty good DJ, pretty good music. My drinks were too strong and not correctly proportioned, but at least the bartenders erred in the right direction. This could be a really cool bar, but it needs a little more personality, a little more style, a little more class. Not bad, though.",3
"Just a fabulous contemporary place...right on the water...
Comfortably furnished indoor and out.
Pride of ownership really shows in the construction material selections.
Upscale crowd for sports, concert events, college football. Fun vibe. Enjoy!",5
"We came from Jackson's for dinner and went to American Social after.  We sat at the outside bar.  There were fans that were blowing really hard and annoying. We asked the bartender to turn it down a bit and she replied that she can't turn it off.  We didn't ask to turn it off, we asked to be turned down.  It was a lovely night temp was in the 70's.  I felt that she just don't want it turned down for she was hot.  Poor customer service for a fine dining establishment.",1
"This place has a great water and riverwalk view with a good choice of upscale and affordable food. It makes it a great choice to stop by when I am in Tampa from out of town.
This time our bartender Kurt made some great suggestions and was very pleasant throughout our experience. We will definitely be coming back when we are in town for the experience and to see Kurt again.",5
Great view but okay food,3
"Some of the best views in Tampa.  We enjoyed a wonderful dinner overlooking the bay. Service was on point, the drinks strong, and food delicious. Go Bolts!",5
"I went to AMSO last week and with great reserve because the last few times I’d come I’ve been met with mediocre service and cold food. However our waitress was a charming young lady this time . Diamond  tended to all of our needs and explained anything we asked. It seemed like the outside bartender was overwhelmed, but Diamond was very apologetic about the wait and was very attentive. If I come again it will under the circumstances that she is my waitress. Her smile is everything!",5
"This was the second time visiting this restaurant. Absolutely, we had a fabulous meal. Kervin our waiter was excellent his recommendations were on point. We expected it to be packed to our surprise it was not, making it quieter than our first visit, which our out of town guest really enjoyed. We tried the frozen rose, very tasteful. I had the vegetarian chili bowl, it was delicious. My friend had the soup & grill cheese she said it was fantastic. Kervin was very flexible with our request for change. His disposition to help is the kind of service you look for in a dining experience. Complements to the chef for preparing great food.",5
Nice location on the deck overlooking the river. Staff was  attentive and professional. Great for drinks. Food was okay. I got the Chicken BLAT sandwich.  It was a little dry but recommend that they take some of the gravy from their shrimp and grits dish and place it on the Chicken BLAT to add more flavor and texture.  I was able to do this and it was just what the sandwich needed!,4
"Great New addition to Tampa! They offer an awesome VIEW & VENUE for lunch, dinner, happy hour, events, nightlife, etc...  The only pain can be parking or valet (they take forever!) & waits for drinks/service on Friday/Saturday nights... Regardless, I recommend this place to all visitors coming to Tampa. The location on Harbour Island Blvd., Just over the bridge - In the same complex as the Weston Waterside & Attached to Jackson's Bistro.",5
The server and food was good,5
"Really nice place, great atmosphere.  Food was delicious and service was outstanding. Sitting outside was great once it got cooler and the breeze from the bay helped. Really recommend.",5
"Cold welcome from the host....Arctic weather in Florida very unexpected. The starter was good as was Randy our waitress.  Unfortunately it went downhill from there with her first not giving us any cutlery which was rectified to allow us to eat our starter.  Then we received our mains again no cutlery as this was given back following completion of the starter.  When we asked for more cutlery Randy looked as if this was a request beyond comprehension.  The cutlery never arrived, so the couple of bites we actually ate of the mains, were with our hands. This is not Mcdonald's venue or similar where you would be expected to use hands or the same cutlery.  The main was beyond garbage, fries were way too salty, had to ask for silverware twice but still didn't receive any...chicken burger so overcooked and stringy that it was inedible. No one asked why we didn't eat our meal as clearly no one cared. First and last visit, all the way from the UK. We have been in the US for over 2 weeks & this is the first time we haven't left a tip. If you want a decent burger, go to the Garrison Tavern in the Marriott hotel, just over the bridge.",1
"Great views. Good food. Went to private party, so don't have opinion about table service. Our bar keep was outstanding!",4
"This may very well be the worst service I’ve ever received at any restaurant, ever.

We arrived and waited for a “Greeter” to seat us...only to be ignored by the waitstaff until my boyfriend asked if we could sit at an empty table in the corner. After a promise to bus the empty table we took our seats. About 15 minutes of sitting at the dirty table, Unacknowledged..a waitress arrives- very nice but obviously overloaded.

I’ll make this brief- the bar staff couldn’t look more disinterested in their task, our appetizer was never made, and our second drink order was lost. After visualizing our waitress numerous times sans drinks- we decided to cancel our drink order and request the check.

We will not be returning to this restaurant.",1
"“The experience was horrible” if I can rate a 0 star I would, my boyfriend and I went 2 nights ago at (7:45) once we were seated it took our waiter Arron 15 mins to Introduce himself and take our order for drinks, the employees were all sitting at the bar watching the hockey game instead of serving customers... to mention there was only 3 other tables inside, another 10 minutes goes by we finally ordered an ‘all meat pizza’  just a pizza...... a hour goes by and still no pizza...... our waiter finally comes back to our table and tells us He is going to go check on our pizza, he disappears for another 20 minutes and someone from the back brings us our pizza and makes a remark ‘ If our team wins the hockey game you can have your pizza’ Now I have been waiting over a hour for my food I am not in the mood for a Joke. The pizza was full of grease puddles, everything was sliding off of the pizza crust. 15 mins later Arron comes back to our table and asks us if we liked the pizza my boyfriend told him no, Arron constantly said it’s “ good right” with a smirk on his face. We just asked for the bill and left..... about 10 mins later my boyfriend and I was sick, for the past 2 days my stomach has been killing me..... I do not recommend going to this location unless you want to wait a hour + for food......",1
Visited American Social this past week for an after work dinner with my co workers. We had a lovely server named Bianca take very good care of our party despite the size. I’ve heard mixed reviews about this place but was impressed by the quality of food and the amazing ambiance. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for great food and a fun vibe.,5
Happy hour after work with the guys(group of 8) Nice place with a good setup. Only downside was  our bartender was pretty inattentive with half the bar empty. Our original bartender cashed out and we got him. Took the better part of 5mins to flag him down for 2 drinks even with us being the biggest group there at the bar.,4
"Food was good. But service at the bar horrible. There were 3 people behind the bar and no attention paid other than taking our order and getting a card to have on file. We had the drink menu left behind so we could go over it and order something but it was only until passed by for the umpteenth time did I get someone to take a drink order. And water and iced teas were never refilled or even asked if we were alright and needed anything else. If I end up back here, I'll ask for a table.",2
Great place,5
"Terrible service.  Bland food.
Another waiter kept helping our table, while our waitress repeatedly disappeared,  he was great.",2
View is beautiful. Food is so so and expensive.,3
The staff was great.  Food not so much almost everyone had to have there food returned do to not being prepared correctly.  And not that I dislike dogs but the table behind me there dog was drinking out of 1 of the restaurant glass cups.  Then it had me wondering how well do they clean their cups.  Because quite a few ppl came with there dog with nothing for them to eat or drink out of.  Sorry was stuck on the dogs.  But again the view and the staff was great,3
although the room was not ready on time they went ABOVE and beyond to help us get ready! They were so over accommodating and so pleasant I had to give 5 stars! Anything we asked they accomplished! The man in charge of our event seen our red carpet and offered there’s; also helped lay n tape down! They brought the DJ in for a bit so I must say ♥️♥️♥️! Food was fantastic,5
"Go to spot on tampa..on the water
.beautiful place.best music to chill to",5
"Great location. Food is good, just wish is was consistent. I went twice in two weeks, ordered the same dish. And quality wasn't the same for both visits.",4
"Food is good, ambiance is great - a nice place to eat and enjoy outdoors. A club esque Fri/Sat night and nice dining all the other nights",5
Went to this lovely restaurant with my daughter for brunch last week and can only say great things about the view and the service we received from our waitress. From the look of how crazy busy everything look I was worried about not getting served or the food being cold... However Diamond was a delight the whole time and was very attentive!! She never had us waiting and has a beautiful smile; if anything her service alone will definitely have me coming back with my family for the holidays.,5
"It's a popular place, lives up to ""social"" part of the name for sure.",4
"We rented one of their private rooms and the service was great. There were at least 2 servers at all times and we had our own bartender. Kids were allowed and it was private enough where kids could play. We had their set menu items and they were also very good, many choices. I would recommend to check this place out.",5
"I loved this place! Very warm,welcoming, beautiful view of the Bay,great drinks. I really enjoyed my evening there.",5
Great and familiar place,5
Great food but slow to get it (1 hour). The Florida Crush cocktail is amazingly good! Service was also touch and go. I do recommend it though.,4
"Holy Smokes! After hearing so much buzz I just had to check it out. My companion and I went last weekend for a lovely dining experience on the water. Our server Paul was friendly, funny and knowledgable about the menu. He recommended we try the spinach dip. Hands down...one of the best I've ever had. We ordered maybe 3-4 apps during happy hour which was an impressive 50% off. A great deal given the ambiance, location and level of service. Great job we'll be back!",5
"American social is beautiful and has private rooms for events (I went for a work holiday party) the staff was professional and attentive and the food was delicious. They also have a beautiful view of the water and docks outside, very classy. I think it's cheaper to valet than to park in the parking garage below it yourself, that's like $20 per hour compared to the maybe $10-$15 valet",5
"I honestly don’t  know where to begin. The atmosphere is perfect for a higher end sports venue, from the lighting to the music, the staff is friendly, and the food is incredible. They offer a wide range of menu options as well, from a brunch, quick in-and-out lunch, to a nice steak/seafood diner. I went with the ""Chicken BLAT"" (Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado and Tomato) it was one of the best sandwiches I've had in recent memory. I would highly recommend!",5
"Great views and good service. I only had the steak sandwich,  so I can't comment on the rest of the food, but it wasn't very good. The bread was probably a couple days old and when you are paying $17 for a sandwich it should be fresh  bread. The sliced ribeye was dry and lacked flavor and the fire roasted tomato and provolone cheese were equally bland.",3
"An amazing spot to sit in the sun and have some good food and drinks. Really was a highlight of my last trip to Tampa. Do be aware that you must ask inside to be seated outside, though, and while the wait was a bit long for my table, it was so worth it in the end! Great view, yummy appetizers and fairly-priced, high-quality drinks.",5
Celebrity my daughter birthday fantastic time,5
"Came here for the first time Saturday night. Nice restaurant, and awesome outdoor bar. Service was good, food was excellent I had the bbq wings, Mac and cheese, and pretzels. Will definitely be back.",4
Good vibe! Perfect combination of food and drinks. Family vibe during the day adult crowd at night. Management and staff have a great floor presence. Late night security is super professional. Highly recommend tjis spot.,5
"I came here with a friend for some late-night dinner and was served by Lily at the bar. She immediately greeted us as soon as we sat down, which is rare as most bartenders wait until you call them over or make eye contact if it’s busy.  She gave us her undivided attention and made sure we knew that we could ask her for anything, no matter how small. She was kind and funny. It’s very rare to find service like that at restaurants. I highly recommend having Lily as your bartender especially if you enjoy a clean cup, ice, and outstanding service. She’s also very honest about which foods to order and which ones to pass on.",5
"A bit overpriced food to go eat on a normal day for lunch, but it is a great place to go after a lightning win! The price is still overpriced but you can tell that this bar is more upscale than others in Tampa. Another thing, that might be inherently better than other bars/clubs is the terrace view and space to move around outside.",4
The worse place in Tampa because the service was terrible and were waiting for 1 hour and a half and there was fifteen tables open. They said it was all reserved. The bar tenders was talking without serving anyone and had to wait 30 minutes for them to serve.,1
"Great vibes, great views. Our waitress, Dakota was great!",5
Always great times on the water at American Social!,5
"Menu was very small and expensive. After ordering, I received my ""Eggs Benedict"" 30 Minutes later. It was  one small biscuit with a slice of Canadian bacon on top and a very small poached eggs on top with diced sweet potatoes on the side. The presentation nor the taste was appealing. My sister had the strawberry waffles. They were hard as a rock, the strawberry and whip cream made the middle of the waffle ""edible"" I guess. My niece, had the chicken and waffles. However, if you do get this, ask for the cranberry sauce on the side. These 3 simple meals were over priced and not worth it. I regret not going to Jackson's for brunch instead.",1
Good Food.,4
"Every time i go to American Social is because aside from the killer view and great food they actually have exceptional hospitality. Lily was my bartender and let me tell you American Social knows how to pick the right people.

Lily knew exactly how to keep the bar fun and social with her exceptional personality and really impressed myself and my friends. She was fast with the drinks and very humorous . 10/10

American social is Tampa's hot spot!!!",5
The service is pretty slow and the drinks are all watery...,1
A nice place for a group dinner or drinks with friends.  Great club vibe after hours.  Menu is a bit overpriced based on the quality and quantity served but perhaps my food was simply mediocre because I was in a large party and it was also busy.  I found the menu to be a bit limited as well.  They were also inconsistent with the drink pricing. A Kettle One martini that I ordered several times at the table for $9/ea later cost me $13.75 up at the bar for the identical drink. Overall I enjoyed the experience but didn't necessarily see the value relative to the money I had to spend.  Perhaps it was a bad night.  I would consider giving them a second chance because the atmosphere is cool and the location is bomb. Keep your receipt from dinner if you park in the garage beneath the restaurant because it gives you 50% off on your parking.,3
"Nice venue. Friday night was packed. Your best if you get there by 9pm after that it really starts to get crowded. There was a blonde female bartender that was a bit of a pain. Not sure if she was having a good night or not, but she walked right by people trying to order drinks and seemed like she picked and chose who she wanted to serve regardless of the order they arrived at the bar. Bartenders job is to serve the drinks, especially when you have people standing around with money in hand.. Other than that, nice place, will give it another shot and hopefully a different bartender will be there...",3
"Nice vibe, tasty food,  and stiff drinks! Ok",5
"Great spot for Sunday Funda, with $3 mimosas.",5
"The food took over an hour to get to us. UNACCEPTABLE!
I do NOT recommend this place!",1
We were attending a charity event.  The happy hour drink prices are awesome.   Parking is a bit pricey.  We were actually double charged it came to about $60. I have sent seven-one-seven parking an email. I still have not received a response though.   The food was very good. We had flatbread pizza artichoke dip and also crab cakes. The water view is fabulous!,5
The waiter didn't come to greet us for 15 minutes it was not busy at all. And the food was just okay nice atmosphere though by the water definitely sit outside,3
"I dined here last night with some friends. We had made a reservation through Open Table. As soon as we arrived we were seated by a hostess. The place was absolutely packed! Our server was very attentive and made great recommendations for us. I was surprised at how fast we recieved our drinks and food due to the large crowd. A manager checked in with us to make sure we were happy. The music is very loud because it is also a nightclub. I would have never guessed they do bottle service! American Social has a breathtaking view with a quality concept, I will be back very soon!",5
Fabiola is an extremely forgetful server but super friendly when she's at your table every 20 minutes. Drinks were good and truffle fries are amazing. The ambiance is very college like and not at all entertaining. The inside club/bar area is mostly reserved for parties and not very much to the general public. I was visiting town and my cousin recommended this place; I will not be returning.,1
"Nice, chill spot on the water.  Fantastic customer service!  Good food.  Will definitely be back again.",5
"Fun atmosphere, good drinks. Food is ok",4
"I went there last night for a holiday party.  The service was great and food good.  However, it is very very noisy (like a typical bar). I am no longer in my 20's so I personally would have preferred someplace  with less noise.  It certainly is a popular place for young people.  It was very crowded.  The view was memorable and the restaurant has upscale decor.",5
"Perfect place to bring the neighborhood for a networking event. Don't mistake this place for a yuppie hangout. While it certainly has it's share of young professionals, it is also a very fun place to relaxby the waterfront and take a load off after the work week.",5
"We had a unfortunate circumstance while eating here. The manager was amazing and went above and beyond to make us feel valued and took care of us. I highly recommend eating here, food was good and waitstaff was friendly.",5
I currently have been sitting at my table for 25 minutes waiting for a waitress. After being completely parched I had a walk up to the patio bar and order a martini with no sugar rim or lemon accent.  Not sure what’s going on but I am far from impressed.,1
"After a nice Sunday at church with my family we attempted to come here to eat. It was 10 of us so we decided to reach out and reserve a spot but we were informed they don’t accept reservations. Upon reaching the restaurant the Hostess was very unpleasant, & condescending. She informed us we would have to wait an hour because a family of 20 had just “reserved” a table. We tried to get some clarification on whether reservations were accepted or not to no avail. Eventually we decided we would order at the bar (although there seemed to be quite a few tables available) and before we could even order they snatched our menus up. When we confronted them about this they said “they thought we would be waiting a bit longer.” Overall I’ll just say you’re not welcome at this restaurant if you’re a person of color & I would advise anybody with morals & anybody who supports equality to STAY AWAY also. I frequently eat at many of the best restaurants in Tampa and I can comfortably say they don’t measure up with their service AT ALL!",1
Ambiance is nice. Patio is super cool. The only thing I don't like about this place is how HOT it gets inside once the place is full. Trying to look cute and having sweat on my upper lip ain't cool mane! I would expect that at the Kennedy not here on harbour island.  Gotta keep it real.,3
Amazing brunch place!,5
"Went here for happy hour. Food and drink prices were reasonable. It took a while for our server to make it to our table but after that, the service was great.",4
"I’ve found it to have decent food, a little pricey, and the service varies with crowd size. It bothers me that they now collect credit cards when you order food and hold them somewhere until checkout (even if paying cash). If someone has not ordered drinks but just food this seems overkill. I’m not sure who is seeing or recording the card info during this time. Also cards only appear to be collected from some customers but not all. Appears to me to be a profiling based on the servers impression of one’s appearance.",2
"Beautiful view, great service, delicious food.",5
"If there was a negative star rating I would have chosen it. I am in Tampa on a business trip for CS Week and Engage 311 and our server Christin could not have been less interested. She was very impersonal and bothered by the fact that my co-workers and I were there. She just dropped our drinks and left. She was too busy  socializing at the next table snapping selfies to be bothered by us PAYING CUSTOMERS. When the food came out she never asked how the food was, if we needed anything else, just nothing. We never got refills on our drinks. It was the worst customer service I have ever received, EVER! I look for reviews when visiting new restaurants and I know the impact that a bad one can have on business. I hope this one gets the attention of management and no one else has to experience this type of service or lack thereof.

~Signed a very dissatisfied customer.",1
"Nice outside near the water but we ate inside- took 20 mins or more just to get a waitress to acknowledge us, another 15 mins to get a drink .. A little expensive but doable ... If you know as a business there is a big event in town, staff accordingly.. I had teammates walk out and go to another restaurant. One actually Ordered and left it took so long ...",3
Great food and drinks.  Service was excellent.  Had lunch and drinks outside watching the boats and enjoying there beautiful surroundings. We had a group of 7 and had a relaxing fun afternoon.,5
Awesome bar scene,5
"The food and atmosphere was awesome. Service was great except they did NOT tell us that you had to get your parking validated. This cost us $10. Very simple thing to ask, but not one employee cared to mention it.",4
Great time cold beer lots of beautiful faces,5
The place very nice. The wait staff were quick and pleasant. If you are looking for a quick grub this place is excellent. May I say the view is exemplary.,4
"Awesome view, awesome atmosphere. Brunch menu was a little weak and pricey. However, food was good and worth the visit",5
Very clean.  Affordable drinks. Great view of riverwalk Tampa.,5
Went the other night. Take head of the many reviews complaining about the service because they are spot on. There is better service at a Panera Bread. The food is glorified bar food as well. 100 other places nearby in Tampa that are better.,1
Bella was our server outside and she was the nicest and friendliest server I have had here by far. She is very attentive and always smiling. Thank you we will be back soon!,5
"Amazing food. A little over priced, but it is still delicious. I always have a great time here and even a better one when i go with Downtown Crawlers team.",5
Nice place. Hostesses were busy talking and I wasn't greeted by any of them as I walked in. Bartender was very friendly and accommodating...if not for this I would've givem 2 stars. I didn't find the menu that special for the over pricing.,3
Best steak ever,4
It's always a fun atmosphere. I've been there a few times and I am always pleased with the experience.,5
"Slow service and rude staff, food was okay but over priced. Ordered a burger and it was cold, didn’t trust the staff to take it back with the attitude they gave me. Overall poor experience after waiting 2 hours for a table when other walk ins were seated before me. That should have been a warning to just leave. Don’t waste your time and money. Much better places in the area.",1
"The mamosa drinks flow and the food is excellent. Great Sunday brunch spot, get there early or you'll find yourself waiting at one of the bars.",5
Delicious food,5
"What a great use of harbor island waterfront space. Great vibe, great atmosphere, and the food. Well, just try a $5 burger on a Monday & come back here and tell me. Amazing place. Highly recommend.",5
Kitchen needs to be open later.,1
AmaZing food! Just a note: it will be about $40 a person. But be warned—you need to make them validate your parking. They customer services workers won’t ask or remind you if you need it validated and you’ll be forced to pay $10 to get out.,5
"Enjoy the experience, but I found that this may not be a place for my age range. It was definitely an exciting place for millennials together and enjoy. My four stars are strictly personal and not a reflection of the Effort or atmosphere is provided by the team. I would recommend you create your own experience.",4
"Lily was AMAZING! Loved all of her recommendations including (a) getting the wings naked and doing a sweet and spicy with the sauces on the side and (b) adding the extra smoked cherries to my Manhattan! She's also super warm, knowledgeable, and a great storyteller. I'm looking forward to coming back!",5
Great atmosphere.. Love the scenery outdoors on the water... Great service... Perfect brunch spot.,5
I love it madison the bartender she was supper nice I really recommend it,5
"Great place for a beer, nice view and good service",4
"We  live on Harbor Island and this is the second time that a fight broke out. Professionally it was not handled well. The “bouncer” let it go after speaking with the bartender. We had a chair launched at us by a fellow patron, alerted the bouncer and there was no action done. I understand making a good tip off of a big bar tab but customer safety is more important. Every time we have come here something negative has happened and it’s just about the last straw at this point. Poor Jackson’s- they have amazing food, service and location and are wrongfully losing business to this half-ass establishment next door.",1
"Excellent eater venue.  The food was delicious.  Drinks were great.  Service kept me from giving 5 dtars, but on the water, you shouldn't be in a hurry anyway",4
Taco Tuesday - way to go,5
Decent experiences here! My go to if I'm looking for a trendy place in the surrounding area to hang for a bit.,4
My group went on a Sunday late afternoon for a drink. The view was beautiful... service was slow to get a drink but it was busy at the bar. The server was very nice and had a great attitude.,4
"This is the worst service we’ve ever received at any restaurant, ever.

We arrived and was told it was 45 minutes to be seated. We hesitated at first but decided to wait at the bar and share an appetizer.  After 45 minutes we were seated outside like requested but no waiter aknowledgement for at least 20 mins. We grab one that walked by us several times and he said he thought we ate already because we had our food from the bar with us. We explained and he took our dirty plates out. Never to be seen again at our table for about 20 more min. I again grab him while he came from the table near us and asked if we can order. He took our order for food and drinks but never came not even with the drinks which at this point was needed more than the food. He kept on serving the same table around us for about 10 more min. That’s when we decided it was enough and left . We will never come back there again, ever. The Appetizer we had at the bar was not all that either so don’t waste your time.",1
"This serves great food and cocktails. I have always enjoyed their cocktails. They taste more fresh and real than many other places. However, the place is a little expensive but offers great view of the water front.",5
the owner will make sure you are taken care of.,5
Great service. Awesome happy hour specials. Best soft pretzels ever & the deviled eggs are to die for. Plus great views.,5
Best new restaurant on harbor island.  Trendy food is OUTSTANDING.  SERVICE IMPECCABLE.  owners friendly and personable.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND,5
"WALTER VIEW
GREAT COMPANY
SPIRITS",4
Basically a bar with mediocre food. Service was good but they need to improve the menu and the food. Peel n' eat shrimp was awful.,3
$50 dollars for unseasoned food. Staff was rude too. Very very disappointed.,2
"March 2019: Good food, service and atmosphere.   The pepperoni pizza was really good.  The chicken salad was nicely done.",3
"One of many visits and though the first person maybe having a bad day, and I almost left, Jason and Taylor's response was phenomenal and not only just turned it around but made it a great experience.",5
The food and service were very good. You must try the goat cheese croquettes! Nice views. It is very popular so very busy and loud. Our table was outside on the water by the bar. We were surrounded by loud apparently drunk people unfortunately.,4
This place is quickly becoming my new favorite restaurant. I have tried a lot of the menu and each item is delicious with its own AMSO flavor and style. The burgers are amazing! (only $5 on Mondays) The atmosphere is great. The music wasn't too loud. The management stopped by to make sure everything was good. Definitely top 3 places in town. Highly recommend.,5
"Went in to eat here and called ahead to get an idea of the wait time and was told on the phone that there would be a 20 minute wait. Got to the restaurant and there were empty tables and a couple in front of us sat down right away and when my party of 3 walked up, the host said they couldn’t seat us because of reservations an hour and a half from the time we walked in. The host was very rude when answering our questions to understand why we weren’t able to get in. Very disappointed with the service and hospitality of American social.",1
"Food was ok. Prices are on the high side but expected because of location. Found it curious that for such a big place, their men's bathroom has only 2 urinals. Not ideal for the amount of people there. I will say, the service was very good. So it made everything else, tolerable.",4
Awesome spot. Great drinks and food. They make a great Old Fashioned. Try the pita and hummus and thank me later,4
"Incredible restaurant and bar! The manager Robert Loveland knows the true meaning of service! If you are looking for an upscale bar with good food, and the best location in downtown Tampa, this is the place to be. Whether it is for weekend brunch, dinner, watching sports, or upscale bar experience they have it all! Brand new location.",5
Excellent burger and fries.,5
"Great food, try the turkey club and truffle fries. Wonderful water view.",5
"Good drinks.. Great happy hour, although the selection for happy hour was way better a few months ago",4
Great atmoshere great staff very good experience.,5
"Visited the outside bar. Nice views, good food and attentive staff. Fun atmosphere. Will definitely go again.",5
"Food was Terrible! Cocktails were cat piss (tried their signature Mule &  Cucumber Fizz  -> both were FAR below average)..Ordered the chicken skewers appetizer (bland and cold? looked like a crows nest), also ordered the flat bread -> came out looking/tasting like slop. Service was a shambles too, our server forgot to bring drinks? DOH! Wouldn't recommend anyone entertaining the idea of dining as this establishment. Party scene was LIVELY though > 11pm!",1
"Go here for the location, the view, and the people watching, not for the food. Service was good but the food took a loooong time to come out. My ordered-rare hamburger was a solid medium and I would have expected a better bun and fixings on a burger that cost $16. The chicken on my wife's Cobb salad was dry and tough. The salad also came out with no cheese on it and the kitchen had failed to tell our server that they totally ran out of cheddar cheese.",3
Good food good views,4
"We had a birthday reservation for 8pm. They weren’t ready to seat us and we waited about 20 minutes. Our waitress was sufficient but was very obviously paying more attention to other tables spending more money. She didn’t even bring a round of waters. The food was terrible for both my husband and I and when I mentioned it she said “oh” took my plate and walked away. Beware and check your bill because they will add the tip without telling you resulting in us over tipping the very average waitress. The bathroom attendant was on her phone the entire time but expected tips for handing out paper towels. Also prepare to valet your car for ten bucks due to no parking for the restaurant. The place gets very club like around ten, they were moving tables out around us while we were still having a sit down dinner. I won’t be back. One star for the beautiful view of the water because Nothing else impressed me and I don’t believe that gives you the right to charge 7$ for a side of carrots.",1
"Very nice experience! I went by myself the bouncers were very nice and cool. The bar was ehhh could have had better customer service in the beginning but made up for it in the end. Everyone was dressed nice and wasn't too crowded, enough room to walk around and vibe.",5
"Great location. Looking over the water and into the city. Awesome for a nice cold drink and a bite. The atmosphere is more for an upscale sports bar to me. Only thing is wait staff seems either under staffed or something, been there during slow and busy times and just they seemed rush and  unattentive. If I'm going to spend more the $100 at a table or bar it would seem to want to be a bit more welcoming on the wait staff. Just my observation.",3
"I live in walking distance to this “restaurant” and don't even consider it anymore. The place has so much potential, but is ruined by the rude service and club vibe. Additionally, I am not a fan of the wasteful advertising, placing menus door to door during the Covid stay home order. Do yourself a favor and try Cafe Dufrain or Watervue and avoid this place.",1
Great atmosphere! Great place to meet up with your associates.  Ty,5
"Great spot. Great atmosphere, food, staff and view.",5
So overcrowded couldn't even get in,2
"To quote Forrest Gump, this place is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you are going to get. Usually great service at the inside bar. If you want to roll the dice, sit at the outside bar or one of the high top tables by the bar. No consistency between visits. Have walked out twice after being ignored for 20+ minutes. Management should focus more on training the employees. On the plus side, the happy hour specials are fantastic. Burger night is good as well.",3
Great drinks overlooking the water and service was great too bad the food sucked and overpriced. Pizza was pretty gross it’s just soggy doughy cheese bread and the Mac and cheese is pretty soupy,2
"Fun place. Men, consider growing out your facial hair before visiting. Had the chicken waffles... eh. Atmosphere redeems all bad sediments. Go check it out, you will enjoy!",4
Great atmosphere and drinks. Pretty nice vibe all around.,5
Great place. Awesome music. Good drinks. Staff was helpful and kind. Only setback was that it was so crowded very had to move around or even dance.,4
Great food and atmosphere. Just what we needed after a day at Busch Gardens!! Thank you Amanda.... great service!,5
"Do you like terrible, overpriced food? Do you like waiting eons for a simple beverage? THEN GREAT!!!!! This is the place for you!

Simply put, this place SUCKS. Unfortunately our friends have no taste and “enjoy” coming here, so we’re subject to patronizing them....if not, we’d never return here again. You’d be better off going to sail pavilion.",1
"Awesome hang out and kept everyone happy during their busiest weekend! We had a blast her Saturday night after Gasparilla. There was a huge line, but we were able to get in without a wait! Thank you! We will definitely be back!",5
"Good food and drinks. The service is absolutely terrible. Drinks were wrong, appetizers never showed up and the bill took 27 minutes AFTER they had my card. Food not worth the hassle.",2
"Nice place great views, excellent service and good large portions.  I was with a very large group of over 30 people and they had all hands on deck, kudos to the servers!",5
"I am a younger looking kid and am treated as such but, food is good. Got my beer in a warm glass last time I visited.",3
Coming here is always a good experience. Not too pricey considering the area but always good service and kind staff,5
Beautiful place by the water,5
The food is delicious,4
"Great view outdoors. The staff is friendly each time we go. The dishes are good, but the fries are my favorite.",5
"Outstanding service, food and environment!!!",5
"emailed Management, they responded extremely apologetic, asked if there was anything they can do, explained moving forward they were going to have a talk with the staff and bouncers, thankful it was brought to his attention and hopes it would not happen again to anyone else.
To start, I ordered a $22 steak, medium. When I received the steak it was cooked well done, most dry steak I’ve ever had. I let the waitress know, and asked for some A1 sauce in hopes it would help, nope, it did not. She did not ask if it made it better or if there was anything else she could do. I did not finish the steak. Not to mention there was enormous amounts of stringed fat throughout. On the bright side, fries were very well.
Next, my friend was troubled by the waitress in regards to payment. He received a notification through his bank of his approved charge, which did withdraw from his account. The waitress said she ran the card three times and the transaction declined each time. Of course management got involved and he showed the manager the notification and his bank account on his Mobil banking app. Eventually it did get resolved, yet still.
Lastly, and most importantly. I am most dissatisfied with my encounter with the bouncer outside. My boyfriend and I were on the patio outside, and noticed a beautiful Christmas tree on the lower level of the steps. I wanted to look at the tree and look beyond the water. The bouncer said I could not take my drink batons that point, no problem. I finished and threw away my can. We then proceeded to walk down the steps, unknowing and uninformed, we could not come back up into the patio. After a few minutes we attempted to walk back to our friends on the patio, but were soon stopped by the bouncer. He THEN informed us we would need to go around to the front and re-enter. I understood why he wanted us to re-enter, it’s policy, to help weed out people who are underaged and already inside before club hours. I was not drinking any alcohol but unfortunately I did not have my ID either. Obviously I would not be able to re-enter. So we sat down on a step near the tree for a while until our friends came down to us. He also did NOT inform the five of them that there was no re-entry. One our our friends was engaging conversation with the bouncer, explaining the situation trying to resolve something out. This was my FIRST time here, so I’m not sure of all rules and regulations, but As the bouncer was in commutations with the rest of the group, I handed my boyfriend my jacket and purse and went to go to the restroom. To soon be grabbed very aggressively by my right arm and yanked back wards. I am a 4’11, 130  pound petite woman being grabbed by a at least 6 ft 250 pound grown man. The bouncer could have just said excuse me you have to go to another restroom, or even just tapped me on the shoulder, there was absolutely NO reason or justification of him grabbing me like that, and embarrassing me in front of everyone. He counts yes to pull me by the arm tightly till we met back to the group, an entire 10 feet,. Then proceeded to hold my lower back as if I was going to take off running. He disregarded the fact I was trying to speak to him and literally ask him where another restroom was so I could go per. He looked over me and began talking to anyone and everyone else but me. Eventually I gained his attention and he explained where another restroom was, I did tell him, “thank you, that’s all I wanted to know. You did not have to completely ignore me”
At that point I was so embarrassed  I was fighting back my tears and all I wanted to do was go home. This will be my last time going to American Social. I hope management sees this review and better reflects to his or her staff. If I was in an altercation with someone or I was doing something innapopriuet I understand why someone would need to be more forceful to break the commotion, but in my situation, he did not need to put his hands on me in that manner. Like I said,  I was in complete compliance with the bouncer and gave no resistance. I’m so entirely disappointed.",1
Tina B was such a good waitress! will come back just for her service :),5
Great atmosphere. Excellent brunch. This is the ideal place for a work get together or any get together for that matter. Very hospitable staff.,5
Food was very good! Lunch specials had moderate portions but they were good tasting and moderately priced. Fun first visit and I'll try it again!,4
Great food and Drinks guys. I met my friends which i havent seen in Ages and it was just a perfect overall meet and vibe.,5
"I begin by saying this is only the second weekend that restaurants have been open and this may have contributed to our negative experience.

We started the day at the Riverwalk Boat Company zipping around the bay in their small boats. We were hungry afterwards and wanted to try a place that was within walking distance.

American Social is directly across from the Riverwalk Boat Company and has a beautiful,  large, patio a floor up overlooking the river with the Convetion Center as a backdrop.

We initially asked to sit on the patio. After waiting about 15 minutes without any acknowledgement from a wait person we were thinking about leaving, but finally somebody showed up who said she wasn't our server, but she could get a drink order started. Instead we asked if we could move inside as it was getting a bit warm.

No problem, she had the hostess help us find a place inside. After about another 10 minutes a bartender came over and took our order.
We waited another 35 minutes with little acknowledgement of what was happening.

My wife wanted to just leave, but I was really getting hungry and went to ask the bartender if she had actually put our food in yet. She said she would go check on it.

She came back and said it was the next order up and she would have a manager come by to speak to us.  Finally, our food came out. To be fair the food was pretty good.  I had the fried chicken cobb salad, my wife had the chicken cesar, and our son had the quesadilla.

The manager came by and asked if everything was alright. She didn't seem to be all that concerned that our order had taken an hour.  She did give us two tickets for free drinks on our next visit.

In summary,  my wife and I love to eat out and were out the day the restaurants were open. We realize how hard this has been on everybody.  Most of the restaurants have been overly friendly and have gone out of their way to make us feel welcome.

Perhaps American Social was inundated by guests that they were ill prepared for. Maybe the kitchen staff was short.  There could have been a number of understandable reasons that we had a bad experience.

If any of that was true, I wish they would have just mentioned that when we first arrived and told us the situation. As it stands,  there are so many great options in SouthTampa to eat, I'll probably never have a reason to go back to American Social.",2
First time here. I thought it would have had a stuffy atmosphere but not at all. Great atmosphere great service. All around really good experience.,5
Amazing place to relax and enjoy with family and friends,5
Expensive for no reason because the food was subpar and so was the service. Our waitress was decent but others were far from it. Many of them appeared annoyed and frustrated and not willing to help when we were trying to get seated. The only thing I liked? The view. We're not going back to this place ever again.,2
Went with some friend for some drinks for the first time at this place and did not know that parking could be validated for the first two hours. I tried to speak to the manager and he said he could not refund me back. Disappointed and not coming back. Poor customer service.,1
Great scenery.  Terrible service.  Currently writing this review and it’s been 28 minutes since we ordered drinks and have yet to get them.,1
"Great atmosphere with an amazing golden hour view! Food, drinks, live music & staff are A+! love it!",5
"Awful service, my boyfriend went to order me a drink for my birthday and the bartender was rude so he got the manager. The manager said hed come over to us and never did. We ordered drinks and had to wait such a long time. The service was rated 0 stars and the professionalism was another 0 star. We will never go back.",1
I love this place. Great atmosphere and vibe especially for drinks after work or on the weekends. Its pricey but everything on the island is. This place is great and I will recommend this to anybody i know,5
"Music, drinks and staff are awesome. It is clean. The view on the patio is beautiful. Even the Security is kind and are gentlemen. Definitely spending a lot of time here.",5
"First time in tampa, this spot is on the water, chill atmosphere, and all age crowd. Honestly I went by myself and still had a great time! It is a bit pricey but that doesn't matter. Give this place a try!",5
I had a wonderful experience at American Social. Paul was delightful to speak to! We enjoyed their HH specials. Half off drinks and a nice menu. I highly suggest their black truffle pizza. To die for!!!,5
Atmosphere very nice.  We were there for an office Christmas Party pit on by Steiner Communities.   2 and sometimes 3 people helping with the bar and very tasty food.,5
The food is decent and they have live music for brunch and it's a club during the weekend. Parking is horrible. I pay 10 dollars for parking every time i visit.,4
"On the water with expansive outdoor seating area/options. We had an assortment of appetizers and margaritas in the outdoor couch area. The steak skewers and the avacado toast were favorites. Empanadas were good, sauce was too sweet (think sweet and sour chicken sauce) and the deviled eggs were okay. Will definitely be back.",5
Insane atmosphere right on the bay of Tampa. Awesome time,5
"Great location, food and service.",4
Crazy packed! Great vibes and right next to Jackson's on the water. Lots of bar space and the only downside is the parking which is $10 on Fri/Saturday night. The best looking people the greater bay has to offer.,5
"Went on Monday for the Grand Opening.. I expected service to be somewhat slow since it was the first day, so no concerns there. My friend ordered sweet potato fries, she was told it would be $3 extra. When she received her bill, she was charged $7 for the sweet potato fries....When asking the waitress why it wasn't the $3 she was told, the waitress simply said ""oh yeah sorry I was wrong"" - didn't offer to change it to the $3 that she was told. You should not be telling your customer one thing, and then taking it back afterwards.

On Thursday, I decided to give this place another try.. I wanted to order take out and bring it back to the office. I searched for the menu online, only to see that there was not a menu online, and I would have to look at the menu when I got to the restaurant to order. This was not a problem for me UNTIL the hostess said that people ordering takeout could not see a menu and that I should look online. At this point, I was fed up with the rude service so I walked away.

I understand that this is a new restaurant, but I think the staff needs a hard lesson how to treat their customers.",1
Bathroom had 3 soap dispensers. All of which were empty.,1
Great food and drink specials. Amazing location as well. One of the top 5 happy hours in the tampa bay area.,5
"It was nice...the setting is great and the restaurant is very nice and clean especially the bathrooms which is what I most definetly pay close attention to. Food and drinks were great and a reasonable price, especially during happy hour.",5
Location is good.  Very nice view.  Food was not very good.  Very expensive.,3
"On the water, lively, great views!!",4
"We went for new years eve party. They had  incredible decore and background scenery was amazing, perfect view of the fireworks. The  food spread was delicious as well. The live DJ kept the party going all night. All staff was very polite and bartenders kept the drinks flowing. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Best new years event ive ever attende .",5
Go for the view. That is all.,3
"Great view. Food was good. Service was disorganized. The hosts and servers disagreed with each other about if free drinks for ladies was a real promotion. We got other conflicting information from different people on staff. Everyone seemed slightly bothered to help. Overall, we got everything we ordered and it was good, but it was not at all easy or seemless.",3
Our waitress was nice but hostess was rude about adding additional seating for our party.,1
"Lively place with indoor and outdoor seating and bars. On the river front. Food was realky good, especially the NY strip prepared Pittsburgh style. Great place to watch sports.",4
"Drinks were awesome!!! The food was great!
The place was a little crowded due to the lightning game however the service was still on point!",5
"Place is nice. Security sucks. Was totally disrespectful to my friend and me for no reason after spending $700 on a table. It’s a restaurant/club not the White house. Be nice, that’s all I ask. Will not be back.",1
Called at 12 to see if we needed a reservation they said no...arrived and there was event and it was only outside seating we were never told that on the phone the wait was an hour so we waited...finally got seated to be only given a limited menu with mostly salads WHICH AGAIN WE WERE NOT TOLD IT WOULD BE A LIMITTED MENU. We basically waited 3 hours from driving to the restaurant to waiting and then not even being told about anything going on. The manager didn’t help all he did was say “I’ll take the blame” but how does that fix anything? POOR customer service POOR communication...,1
Grown and sexy. They have music for all ages. They have food that I want to try on my next visit,5
"Been here twice, different dates and times. Both crowded which I get why there can be a long wait for servers to bring the food BUT both times orders were confused, food was okay, not above and beyond in taste or even temperature. First night beers were warm and after ordering a second one it was never delivered to us. Second time, on a brunch, food was good but then again, temperature seemed like it had been out for a while before they brought it over. My friend's dish was wrong, the waiter insisted it did not have any avocado on it, which was one of the main reasons why he ordered it (lol). He asked for it to be changed, we all ate our food and still no exchange. By the time it was exchanged we were already done! and we were a party of 7 people!! The view is amazing, I'll give you that but I honestly think it's an overhyped  hipster joint. Too pricey for their service and food. I've had better dishes and service at other places.",2
"Wow, this place is the worst. First of all, the hostesses don't have a clue what's going on. I could do a much better job seating people and I don't even work in the service industry! Second, about half of the tables were being used outside (busy peak hour for happy hour on Friday), so there's that. Monumental waste of money for the owners. Third, the bartenders are about as good as bartenders from McDinton's that ignore you and basically can't keep up with the large amounts of orders. The only thing good about this place is the view; but even that gets old after a while.",1
Love the outdoor bar. Great food & drinks. A little pricey but ask about specials. Good happy hour promos,5
"Good food, good service,  amazing environment, management was on top of everything. No drama or bull××××. Will definitely return. Also amazing views.",5
"Nice place, way too loud.",4
Very good food,5
"First time at this restaurant. We were seated quickly but the problem took place next. We waited more than 15 minutes at our table and nobody took our order. It was a lack of communication but unfortunately, we will not go back.",1
Good food great time pretty view make reservation.,5
"Food was super good, and super good customer service!!",5
"Good waterfront scene. A little spread out and overwhelming. Food was enjoyable, and service was friendly.",4
OK food. Service not great. They could not make 1 drink and did not have  1 dessert on menu... server should have known this before making us wait.,3
"Sat at the outside bar.  Good service comfortable place but very busy.  Great drink selection, especially bourbon",4
"Great place, great food and Emily November is the bomb!  Best waitress ever. Felt like we were family!",5
"Our waiter... simply amazing. The attention to details, the ability to interact with my buddy's parents sitting at the table, making them laugh at his jokes/jestures... It's just top notch service I tell ya. I'm trying to remember what I had to eat though 😂",5
"Best happy hour ever! Awesome view, great food and beer, big screen TVs...",4
Perfect place for a function... Wings were tasty but the appetizer buffet lacked just a little ooomph. Filler plates are easily spotted.   2 hours of validation.  5 dollars for staying 15 mn over.   Bartenders not as attentive as they could be but good evening nonetheless!,3
Food was great and the servers were very kind. The only thing I did not like is that I was in a private party room and people keep walking in by accident. But overall a great experience.,4
Close right after the fights very disappointed,3
Food was good. Service started off great then not so good. Would go back! Oysters we're on point.,4
Great place to eat! Sitting outside by the water is an added bonus. The heating lamps come in handy for cool evenings.,5
Good food.  Outside seating was pleasant.  REALLY enjoyed the Avocado Toast!,4
Now this place was fantastic especially for its location. Great mix of various crowds. So much fun!!,5
"Food was okay but the atmosphere and view keep you there. Brunch on a Saturday, yes please🙋‍♀️!! Bottomless mimosas for ladies on a Saturday with an entree is a really great deal.There is also a buffet option on the inside (don't remember price) but the regular menu worked out better for us.*Disclaimer: Can't vouch for anything other than brunch*

Would recommend a reservation because they stay consistently busy but a good time to hangout on the river. Indoor and outdoor seating is available and good for large groups. Cute place to take out of towners to get that Florida vibe and entertain guests (even if it's just for drinks). Also, near a water taxi stop which is always a plus. Parking was garage parking but they do validate, just don't forget to see the hostess before leaving.",3
"The view is amazing, the design and atmosphere are beautiful which definitely adds appeal, and keeps me coming back.
But I've never been impressed with the service, or the food. Perhaps part of this has to do with the fact that it has been jam-packed since opening, but I definitely do not go there looking for or expecting a fantastic meal, or accomidating and pleasant service.
I will definitely go back again and again, because as I said, you can't beat that view and it is a pleasant place to have a cocktail, just make sure you aren't too thirsty, and bring your patience with you!",3
"Nice place to enjoy food and drinks.  Night life is even better, mix crowd and music. Go check it out for yourself, you will definitely enjoy yourself.",5
Food is subpar. My avocado toast was burnt and cold prior to arrival to table. The wings were dry... even though we asked them to be “extra wet”. Good ambience and mimosas though. I wouldn’t recommend eating here if you’re hungry.,2
Came for brunch. Great atmosphere!! The food and mimosas were good as well.,4
It was ok. Beautiful view of course but over priced menu. Bartender was great though!,3
"I love this place. Went with the wife and kids and the service was amazing. Food was great, the view even better! Great place.",5
"We felt let down by multiple incidents and issues at this restaurant. Our waitress was so busy she couldn't even fill up our water glasses and we were eventually just given a pitcher. (There were only 4 of us...)
She struggled to focus on our orders as she was rushing around everywhere. The food is really subpar for the price and takes a while to come out. Almost everything that sounded decent on the menu was already finished and we had to have 2nd or 3rd options ready. Not once did we see a manager walking around taking note of the problems faced by staff. Items ordered were never placed and we were incorrectly overcharged for one meal.
I see that there are a lot of positive reviews so we might have been there on a bad night where they had the B Team working and an assistant manager who was overwhelmed or didn't care.
All in all, take your money elsewhere, it's not worth it.",1
Fun place. Good music. Good appetizers. Clean.,5
"My family came in last night for drinks, sat outside within 10 feet of the bar. The server came by and took our order. A few minutes later someone else came by to make sure we were taken care of. We told him our order was placed. We waited over 10 minutes and no drinks no server no sight of the server no nothing. Finally we called an Uber and left.",1
Outstanding place to enjoy good people and fine dining!! I was very impressed.,5
"Great crowd, great food, great ambiance.",5
Lively nightlife on the weekends. Always fun. Great music.,5
Gorgeous atmosphere with fantastic service. The good was amazing but a bit on the pricier side. You definitely get what you pay for though. 10/10.,5
Great outside bar,5
If you are looking for a nice place to vibe to with good people this is the spot for you there's no craziness in here just Good Vibes and good fun,5
Nice view excellent service and prices,5
"Horrible customer service. I made a reservation then when we get there I said I wanted to have an outside seat and they said I would have to wait an additional hour for that WHEN I made a reservation. Once we ordered our drinks, appetizers, and main courses our drinks didn’t come for over 15 minutes then we get our main courses...WE NEVER EVEN GOT THE APPETIZER.  Definitely don’t recommend.",1
"The weather was immaculate, hello Florida! It was a great day with perfect attention to detail thanks to our barkeep Lili. The bar was busy but, my drinks & food were on point. The manager came by check on us and even gave us around on drinks. Thank you and cheers",5
"Service was non existant. The MOD was too busy flirting with two ladies at the next table to notice me sitting at my table with no silverware and my food quickly getting cold. 4 trips to the table next to me, and the manager still didnt notice my dirty looks or my hand gestures. The manager ended up comping my appetizer, but never came out to explain or offer an apology. My entree came before my appetizer, and my drink order was wrong 3 times...how much is it to ask for a cranberry juice in a rocks glass?  Too much for this place...
I will try next door if I'm ever in town again.",1
Loved the outdoor area.  Menu has plenty to offer.  Great service.   Very accommodating for a group of 15.,4
"Thank you to American Social for a fantastic company holiday party. Carla put together a great evening for us and the servers, Joshua and Mike took great care of us. We genuinely appreciate it.",5
Great place to experience downtown and the water overlooking the convention center! Food was great. Brunch goes a bit late till 3. Biggest drawback was the edm music pumping loudly on repeat. Why not have a American oldies or American hits on repeat? It's only lunch lol,4
Loved their frozen coquito!,5
Food was only okay.  The place was very crowded and there was no concept of social distancing...or masks!,3
Great happy hour with food and drink specials. Nice atmosphere and friendly servers.,4
We have been here a few times for different reasons. The food here is just ok. The event we were attending this time was in the back room. Becuase the humidity was bad they could not open the doors which made it impossible to hear any one once the room filled up.  This is a simple fix that can be solved by using the right decorations.  The other issue we had was that the bartenders seemed to not happy about working. The event was a ticked bar set up that only served well drinks and beer.  It's not that hard to keep a smile on.,2
Love the brunch. The food was spot on with a comfortable relaxed atmosphere.,5
"Real nice place to chill during the daytime. Good food, music, and football!",5
A place to be. Liked the atmosphere and food. Good for group events.,5
"Wonderful service, we made a late reservation here on Google, walked in we were seated, and food was fantastic!! The burger was cooked to perfection!!",5
Mojito. Pizza. Waterfront view. Classy and a great date spot.,5
"A stunning place, couldn't ask for a better environment on the water!  Harbour Island was in need of a fresh venue, and American Social delivers.  Great food, friendly staff, and a beautiful view, can't wait to come back!",5
Good food. Friendly staff. Comfortable lighting and seating.,4
"Walked in and the music was ear bleedingly loud. The entry way was tiny and you couldn’t hear anything the hostess said to you. Once seated in what can only be described as a makeshift frat house, with a lovely view and decor to be fair, we sat ordered drinks and our waitress vanished for twenty minutes and we just left. Some quick bullet points: the crowd is all twenty something inebriated shouting college kids, if that’s your thing you would love this place. The prices are absurdly high, $20 for a cheeseburger. Also they neglected to tell us there was a limited menu and that there were literally 4 items on the menu that we could order. Much better places you could go to in Tampa if you’re willing to pay upscale dining prices.. Avoid IMO.",1
Thank you all for the reviews. We have been for 3 days and are working on making this place the best. We always strive for excellence and will continue to improve.,5
"Good atmosphere, nice outdoor location and good service. Cocktails a bit bland, beer was good.",4
Great location. Loved sitting out on the deck,4
"Probably one of the worst experiences I’ve had at a restaurant. The hostess couldn’t properly assess the wait time correctly for a table. Our waitress didn’t know how to open a bottle of wine, as well as got our order wrong. The oysters were filled with shells and food was Costco purchase quality. The management was inept when we told them about our experience. The extent was limited to, “How was everything this evening?” With minimal follow up to our concerns. This place is priced at a 5 star level but the staff is what you’d expect from a fast food place, at best. ZERO PROFESSIONALISM OR CLASS. I would give less than a star if possible.",1
I went with my husband and a couple of friends and I loved it. We were outside where they did the silent Disco.,5
"I went to AMSO for the first time this weekend (Friday) and it was a good time because I am very social. The DJ was AWFUL, but I find that to be the case everywhere in Tampa. I arrived at 9pm... ate at the bar and the service was good.. by 11pm there was a nice crowd. There was no drama and an overall good time.",4
"Came in for a Lightning watch party.  Was very impressed with the food, drinks and service.  Will for sure be coming back again.",4
Came here for brunch and wasnt disappointed! Food and service was good. You doesn't want bottomless mimosas while sitting by the water.,5
PSA: their well vodka is Pinnacle. F*% cheap pinnacle! Nevertheless they charge $11/drink. 3 stars for ambiance only.,3
"My wife and I went here when we got to Tampa.  We had to go to the convention center and saw this complex across the river.
We arrived about 1630 and were presented with an alcohol menu and a very small food menu (dinner service starts at 1700).   We had a drink and waited for the full menu.  We asked for outside dining and they told us no problem and a minute later came back with only inside available.
Their local draft beer (and some national small breweries) selection was quite good.  The Heavy Seas tropical IPA was quite good and interesting, then the Buddha IPA was traditional and very good and finally the local Beach Blonde was really good.
My wife ordered the chicken Cobb salad.  Very traditional however the choice of dressings was very limited Ranch and a few vinaigrettes.
I ordered the grouper fingers and cheeks (after the waitress had already mentioned a couple of menu items they were out of on a Saturday evening) and they were out.  I ordered the mac and cheese with Key West shrimp (I guess that means tiny) that were plentiful in the dish and added a touch of flavor.  The side of pretzel bites were pretty good.
Finally a side of fries were good.
Service was average to slow.
While I would return if it would not be a top choice.",3
"The sight at this place is just wonderful (I went in the day and), you can appreciate great part of the Tampa Bay here. In addition, the service is very kind and the food is good, I really recommend you any kind of burger.",5
Nice outdoor dining. They allow dogs as well.,5
"we celebrated my sons 22 birthday here, our server was Asia, she provided great service, very efficient, extremely kind & kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed!!! Would definitely recommend and if she’s working please ask for her !!!!",5
Decent brunch menu and $3 mimosas are always great,4
"Awesome drinks, really good food, and an awesome view of the water when you walk outside. Definitely recommend going during happy hour, (5-7pm, I think)",5
Not a wide selection of food and what they do have is very overpriced. Food quality was good though.,3
Had many fun nights there. Good atmosphere and drinks. Be aware that they stop letting people in an hour before closing. We were disappointed we took an uber there to meet friends and were not allowed in..,4
"Had an  absolutely wonderful time we went for pre Gasparilla, great place great music nice view met some new friends highly recommend this place",5
"Our sever, Gracie was a charm! I came in with a bunch of ladies, we ordered drinks and apps and it all came out quickly. The spin dip was phenomenal, idk what they put in the pita bread, but it is amazing. The cheese pizza was also surprisingly delicious! I ordered a mai tai and it was wayyy too syrupy. Gracie took it back with no questions and brought me something else.

The atmosphere was so cute and modern and right off the water. When we can in on a Friday night it was packed with people of different ages and races. Some dressed high end, some in jeans and tanks.

Overall, this place was cool and would be fun on date night or girls night!",5
"Absolutely loved brunch at American Social. Most of all, Crystal at the bar took really good care of us!!!",5
Great place to hang out.   Was there with my friends and a few of the Lightning Alum this past weekend.   Service was great.,5
"Good lunch in a touristy area of Tampa. Nice atmosphere inside and out, And views of the water are nice.  The bartenders make great drinks in the prices are too badd. It's a cool place to hang out near the convention center.",4
"Great happy hour specials. The smoked wings are on point. The atmosphere was great too, right on the water.",5
I absolutely love this place! The food was great and so was the service!! We had Cassidy and she provided great service and information about the menu!,5
Good food selection in a fantastic location! Great view!,5
Great place to enjoy the waterfront dining and dining experience. Outdoor dog friendly as well as people friendly the music is loud the drinks are flowing the food is excellent and the company is fun. Wonderful place to hang for any occasion.,5
You won't be disappointed with the steak heuvos rancheros! Amazing flavor and a little kick to wake you up. Solid location overlooking the water.,5
TINA WAS THE BEST SERVER HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!,5
We visited on July 4th. Perfect spot for fireworks. Food was delish as long as you can get a fork to eat it with. The Manager bought us a rough d to make up for the whole silverware issue.,4
"Good atmosphere, they accommodated a large party with short notice.  Food is good and the views are great.",5
"Worst place ever.  They are so busy but they don't know how to handle it.  We got bumped from our reservation , no explanation very frustrating. Or whole table does not feel the Tampa love.",1
"This place was amazing. Was in town for a wedding. A few of us went the night before the wedding and had so much fun that the entire wedding party went after the wedding. Wedding gown, tuxes and all.",5
Absolutely loved it! Food and service was top notch!,5
Stephanie rocked! Thanks girl for the great service,5
Good mix of music. Whatever your dancing preference is you will find it.,5
"The prices here are great for what you get. Only problem is the parking.  I'm not familiar with the area, it's possible that other and cheaper parking is available beyond what is below for the building. Seating is strange inside and really loud due to any walls breaking the groups of people. Outside bar area has a nice view of the harbor.",3
Bouncers are racist. Got harassed going to and from bathrooms. Jackson is better but you still have to leave to go use the bathrooms. Better off going to ybor,1
"We LOVE  this place.  View, food, bar and service.  Cannot be beat.  Many happy hours here.",5
Great food and drinks,5
Nice place on the water to get drinks and food. Outside covered eating area and bar. $$$,5
Great happy hour. And this place in my opinion has the hottest bartenders and waitresses and hostesses of any place I have ever eaten at or had drinks at.....kudos...oh btw...food is good too,5
"Worst service ever, bartender couldn't make a simple Russian mule, and food completely was disgusting. I went because of the great reviews, but was not impressed.",1
Great Sundays  Brunch with Drinks Football And The People / Animal friendly Waterside,5
Busy loud youthful crowd but exciting and somewhat fun.,4
Love this place. Food is great and the drinks are awesome! We will definitely be back!,5
"Gorgeous views, good food. The happy hour oysters were tiny, but delicious! $6/6 oysters, even though they were small, it was worth it.",4
"Your typical South Tampa experience. Drinks are good, but overpriced. Food is the same. Their menu doesn't have anything beyond the basic glorified bar food. The best thing about this place is the view of the Bay.",3
"The place was really nice, just be very careful with the parking rate. When I arrived it said $10 parking for the event, it was the super bowl and I  was working there with a big led wall, but when I left I had to pay $61 for 16 hours and there said maximum daily rate $36. That was horrible.",3
Amazing food and Great service!,5
Liked the food.  Service could be better,4
Tara was the best server ever!! She put all of the others to shame. She worked so hard to make sure we had everything while always having a smile on her face! Her bright spirit made our night!,5
"Food was good.  Service was a problem.  Had to ask 3 times for the dressing for my salad.  Half of us,  party of five,  got our food and the other 2 had to wait. Then brought the wrong order.  So had to wait again.",4
"ANDY was super awesome with my group of friends from work , he  made us a private dinning table super nice and understandable  thank you! look foward to going back .",4
"Lunch- Waitress Recommended a blackened mahi with sweet potato fries. The mahi was nonexistent maybe a quarter of an inch thick, all I tasted was the onion and tomato, french fries came out cold, had potential of being good if they weren’t cold, water refills were hard to come by. By the way— $18!
Would not recommend.",1
Great service with an AMAZING VIEW,5
"Good ambiance, good service, TVs on every wall, good food. Definitely recommend",5
"Wow is all I can say. The Also burger was delicious. Drinks were cold, food was good and the place is beautiful. I think I found my new go to spot.",5
"Lily is amazing. She’s incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and gives great food/drink recommendations. So happy to find her!",5
"Service started out great. We went at 1530 on a Friday. I ordered a sandwich off the in and out menu that took 40 minutes to come out. Our waiter wouldn't even come over, he sent a different server over to tell us they were making the fries. When I finally got my sandwich after talking to the manager, it didn't even come out with the sauce on it that it was supposed to have a was terribly dry. I went here with 3 others so we didn't have a big party. Service was terrible, food took forever, and we left completely disappointed and will not go back. Do not waste your time or money on this place.",1
"Not your typical bar food.  This place has a menu that far exceeded my expectations. This is a bar that takes food seriously. The ambience is lively, the drink selection is wide and the food is incredibly delicious!",5
"Great food, parking isn't easy but they'll validate two hours worth.",4
5 different items we requested they didnt have but the happy hour was so cheap and the people were so nice and apologetic it made up for it. I'd totally go back for happy hour but not any other time the quality wouldnt justify the price outside of the happy hour. The via roppa was the best dish we got.,3
"Great, fun space in South Tampa. Also a terrific space to hold events.",5
"Good views and right on the water. Packed on weekends and a little pricey, but overall enjoyable bar with lively vibes",5
great atmosphere and drinks,5
First time there good food and atmosphere,5
Good food and drinks!,4
We will never come here again.. i was seated more then 15 min later i was asked if i wanted water.. the people next to me walked out. Our server sucked she blamed her absentees on a party on the other side. Also she told us today is her last day so she really doesn't care. Wooow. We can tell! The service was trash.. this star is for the egg station guy he was polite.,1
"If I could choose zero stars, I would. They wouldn’t take reservations, so we waited over an hour to get a table for my girlfriend’s birthday. None of the bartenders would make eye contact, and even getting drinks was a production. We waited for “a large table to open outside” that a previous party was about to leave from... there are no large tables outside. Talked to a manager and finally got some tables pushed together. None of the food came out together (including the sides- fries, mashed potatoes, etc.) and the prices were outrageous for the proportions. Definitely wouldn’t reccomend for anything serious or a special occasion.",1
"This place has an amazing atmosphere, delicious food and plenty of local brews to compliment the menu with the best waterfront view in Tampa. Harbour Island and Tampa desperately needed a place like this to go before Lightning games and concerts, or just for happy hour or monday night football. Great job American Social!",5
Absolutely enjoyable! Great food 👍 Great atmosphere 👍Fantastic view 👍,5
"American Social is awesome! Great food, Great service, Staff is cool and the drinks are really good. I love the scenery there and you meet awesome people. Good crowd, more laid back environment. Great music selections as well and the food is pretty good. Not sure if there is a cover but it was free when I went. Drink prices aren't bad only thing I dont like is parking.... seeing that is apart of a hotel I had to pay 15 bucks just to park... Definitely a must go to if you're down channelside.",5
"Good food, great decor. Definitely more of a bar than a restaurant.",4
"American Social Tampa is well designed, service is fantastic and I love the menus. The Shrimp and Arugula salad is still my favorite, but the new entrees are fantastic as well. This place is great any day or night. I've been for Lightning games during the week, Friday HH's and weekend brunches...yet to be disappointed! Love AmSo and will always support this great new location!",5
"Very good drinks, some of the food is excellent as well. Call ahead for reservations if you want to sit and eat for larger parties",5
"Really friendly staff, reasonable prices for quality, taste good. Get a window seat to view the river at night!",5
Terrible. 35 minute wait we were told. About half the place was empty. Told it was for reservations but after being there for two hours not one table was used. Finally sat at the bar and waited 5 minutes to get greeted. When our table was ready it was an hour. So much for that 35 minute wait. With a half full restaurant. Ordered wings and soup and we waited 45 minutes to get food. Never saw a manager. Wings were dry and not worth 16 dollars for 10. Took 15 minutes to get a side of hot sauce. Bill was 96 dollars for two wings and 5 titos soda. Wow. Won't return.,1
Great experience I will be returning,5
We were in town for business. Stopped here in the evening a couple times. Wasn't that impressed. Music outside was loud which made it hard to have conversations. Plus it wasn't the best selection (hip hop or rap). Food was average. Service was ok. Nothing special here.,3
Absolutely excellent,5
"Beautiful place , awesome food and great service, prices are not bad either. A big beer variety and lots of TVs",5
Vegetable chili was delicious. My Floridian beer was cold and the patio is great.  Look forward to many returns,5
"This club the vibe, inside, outside, WHATEVER YOU PREFER THEYLL MAKE IT WORK! Love the people here",5
Amazing scenery and top-notch food and service. It is highly recommended.,5
"I am not going to rain on the party. Nice club. Looks very similar to outside setup of next door; however, it is beautiful there.",5
"Excellent atmosphere , staff, and food",5
Awesome bartenders.  Manager went out of his way to get the game we wanted on the tv. They created a new dish on my sugestión...priceless❣,5
"Good food, nice view, super cute waitress with freckles and dimples😍😍😍",5
Had a great time with my co workers hanging out at the outside bar.  Everything was awsome.,5
"Really good burger, definitely add the smoked pimento cheese and a fried egg.",5
We just came for drinks with a waterfront view.  The staff was attentive and friendly.  The patio is lovely and casual.,4
"Beautiful view, but food was not good. No flavor, not tasty. Some of the waitresses were in outfits that were just outright trashy. It could be a really nice place, just need better food and more class.",2
Love hanging out here. Very relaxing..Great service.,5
Nice spot on the island. Service is beyond unacceptable. Staff is more concerned about the technical aspects and Totally ignore the customer needs. I'm flabbergasted at the lack of customer skills these guys have even The managers don't have a clue.  Very process and compliance driven staff with no attention to detail regarding the customer experience.,1
"You ever see a restaurant squeeze every dollar possible out of you? Well if  you haven't this is the place. Not bad, but you are basically paying for the view. Service is average for the area and drink prices are a bit above average. Food prices are definitely inflated.",3
"Nice place, good atmosphere and the food was pretty good. All in all a good place to grab dinner if you have plans in the area.",5
tina is the best server!!!!! amazing service and food !,5
"Kervin was a great server
The Mahi Tacos are amazing!!!
American social is such a vibe especially on the patio",5
Went 2 days in a row great food good service awesome vibe,5
Depends on what time you go. Bartender waitress was more interested in telling everyone how busy she was instead of asking what you wanted to order. 🍷,2
Place was great. Friendly and great food and music. Tara sure goes out of her way for her customers.,5
"Zero service. Yes ""Zero"". Plenty of staff walking right by and ignoring us for 10 full minutes while we tried to make eye contact. Only a handful of customers around the bar, but it seemed the staff didn't want any customers at all. I can only assume the girl who refused to leave her conversation while slightly looking at us out of the corner of her eye was the bartender (Asian girl around 4pm on Thursday 11/2) and the rest were bar backs walking around doing something with their cell phones. The girl was clearly waiting us out wanting us to leave... and she won. We left for Jackson's without a single person ever acknowledging us. If this were my restaurant, I'd be furious! I hope to hear American Social makes drastic changes, especially replacing horribly incompetent and rude staff, or I'll never go back.",1
"The manager and bouncers are deaf to facts and will side with a lie..

In town for business, I decided to meet some friends that are local and I haven't seen in 30yrs.

You have a dishonest and untrustworthy bartending staff. I never said a disrespecting word to your staff. Why would I give her a $20 tip and then call her ""fat"" . Really!! What kind of an idiot does that?

I was asked to leave the bar with only the lame excuse of ""she said.........""

I want disparage the entire establishment. But a word of advice. Respect your clientele and gather ""All"" the facts before you"" Kick"" a paying customer out of your establishment.

Your legal bills could become costly!!

All I requested was reimbursement for the drinks your staff removed from my table and poured out.",1
"Not what Tampa needed -- another overpriced burger joint.  Had the worst restaurant experience in a long time here last night.  Drinks took 30 minutes, our meal took over an hour.  Management did not seem to care at all.  Took another 30 minutes to get the check and 30 minutes to get it paid.  We all would have rather stayed home and cooked there.",1
I went here for brunch with friends and enjoyed the food and atmosphere. There is also outside lounge and bar area that has a nice view of the water.,5
"If you go here on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to deal with ""security"" that tells you where to stand. Typical south Tampa vibe with people that think their poop doesn't stink. The bartender was nice, but overwhelmed.",2
"Location and view is beautiful. Music was very loud inside. Service was awful. Waited over an hour for a burger and over priced salad. I’m truly hoping they can turn this around. From other comments, I’m not the only one with the bad experience.",1
Overrated. Food was so so. Pretzel bites might have been the worst appetizer I have ever had... Basically fried chunks of biscuits. I sent them back. They were nothing to do with pretzels. Sat at the bar to eat and then was hurried up by staff to finish so they could remove chairs at 9pm. It would have been nice to have been told that they did not serve at the bar after a certain hour before I ordered...maybe others have had better experiences but I won't try and eat there again,2
"The concept of American Social is unlike anything else in the Tampa Bay Area. The staff handles themselves with extreme professionalism and creates an amazing atmosphere. Highly recommend for casual dining, happy hour, or a unique nightlife experience.",5
Had a great time!! The food was delicious. I had the salmon strawberry salad.,5
"Service was slow, waiter was not friendly. I ordered the steak frites. My steak was supposed to be medium rare. Easily medium well and chewy. The chimichurri sauce was good, but I had to choke down my steak, so what's the point? The fries were fine.",2
Average food made better by the awesome location,4
Beautiful setting definitely the place for the younger generation. Starting with security to servers great personalities.,5
Good food. Chill vibe. Scenic views. Easy parking,5
"American Social (AmSo) was pretty good.

The only reason it's getting a 4 was delayed service. It took about 15 minutes for someone to realize that we hadn't been helped after being seated and the restaurant was was pretty empty. That aside, the waitress was amazing (great on refills, great personality, and great at navigating the menu).

I ordered the AmSo burger (delicious), my wife ordered quesadillas (average), our friends ordered the hummus w/ pita bread (AMAZING).

Overall, we were satisfied and would go back to explore the menu and enjoy the atmosphere.",4
"Great Brunch! The food was unlimited (omelet station, potatoes, fruit and more). Watched the Bucs game at the same time and enjoyed the company of great friends.",5
Our bartender Alyssa made our first time there an amazing experience! She is super personable and an awesome bartender!,5
Get there before the club hours rush. Fun place right off the water. Good music and drinks.,5
"So my friend from is in town. I wanted to take her somewhere on the water. We went to dinner tonight at American Social and the staff went all out to show her what Tampa is all about! Thank you to the cool valet guy (who sold us on the restaurant out front, got us out of the car and gave us VIP parking😂), our lovely server Katie who recommended great food, James the awesome busser, Briani & Jacob the hostesses with the mostest...period, and especially Tre Roundtree for SUPER customer service and amazing food!  We loved the music playing. It was a Wednesday night so it wasn’t too crowded or busy, mostly a dinner crowd.  Our server Katie, however, invited us to come back on the weekend for dancing and an a DJ! They also surprised my friend with a sweet treat for her birthday! You made her day, impressed us both and made a customer for life! THANK YOU! ❤️❤️",5
"OMG this place is amazing to have a good time, there was some live music, the drinks were very good and the food was don in a fair time.",5
It's always a pleasure to come to the American Social. Drinks and food are awesome. Crab cakes are to die for!!,5
"Still just the worst, most spotty service... Doesn't matter if they are slammed or sparse - you never quite know what kind of attention you're going to get. Even worse, I live around the corner and consider myself a ""regular"" who comes here 2-3 times a week. I always sit at the outside bar with my dog and while everyone is pleasant enough, the bar staff can't seem to coordinate who is responsible for who. Oh well. I'll keep coming back, but my tips are getting less and less.

And obyw - figure out when you're going to honor your ""game day"" specials. They clearly fluctuate.",2
"I was here with a group of people during my vacation. Once we were seated no waitress/ waiter came for 15min; we had to flag down someone just to be serviced. Then, we had to flag her down again after waiting 20min for our bill. On top of all that, the menu was limited and the food was mediocre.",1
Went there for my Birthday and it was a disaster! I will never return.,1
I could feel the Love as I walked through the doors. The security cracked Jokes with me in the line and the people inside are ready to party.  The music is great too because they always have Tampas finest in the booth. #LETSGETIT,5
Friendly staff but very very slow. Decided not to have dinner because it took 20 min just to get a drink on a Tuesday night and wasn't busy.  Do not order a mojito I had to send it back once I hunted down the waitress so i decided to stick with beer.  Atmosphere and view was great.,2
Great food at the private event I attended and the view is always excellent!,5
"Joined a group of friends for a birthday outing. Our table was not ready despite having a reservation. The food was not worth mentioning and worst of all the waitress added gratuity to my husband and my check with out telling us. I generously added 22% tip on top with out realizing! This made me furious and taken advantage of. I should have checked my bill but I am not the type of person to review my bill with a fine tooth combing for errors. The gratuity was placed in the middle of the check where it was not obvious along with a note at the bottom of the check suggesting gratuity amounts. Very tacky!!!!
We will not be back!",1
Relaxing Atmosphere.  Food was good and prices were average for the area.,4
The beverage director and the female bartender he is probably dating we’re abosuktely terrible. Waited 45+ minutes to get drinks and then was told to leave after complaining how we weren’t able to spend our money to buy their drinks. Thomas the server saved the day and helped us out so much and I am so grateful for him. I was literally in tears because the “beverage manager” was so aggressive and mean to me for no reason. Thomas is the only saving grace in this place,1
Excellent food. But the service here is very slow. I have been waiting for about an hour just for my entre. The entre is also really bad. Not my favorite place. And you can't enjoy some peace and quiet at this place. People constantly yelling. I just can't handle it. And the music here is really annoying.,1
Jason is the best manager in the planet,5
American social is a fun relaxed hang out spot.  Bet popular at night.  Prices reflect the quality of the fare.  You get what you pay for here.,5
"It's a great location. I enjoy that it's on the water. But the service was lackluster and I wasn't impressed with the drinks. I was at the patio bar and tried ordering three different drinks that I was told ""Oh I don't have one of the ingredients I'll have to go inside to get it."" Didn't expect that considering the drinks were featured on the menu. So I stuck with a simple vodka soda. The wait was longer than it should've been for a simple drink. Liked the Margherita flatbread though.",3
Great Happy Hour drinks and prices.,5
Great atmosphere and vibe. Fun drinks and great food.,5
Location is great.  Service not so much.  Food is pretty good for bar food.,4
"Very nice on the patio, over looking the bay. Basic menue, the hamburglar i had was very good. Fair prices. I will go back.",3
We just tried to get a table on the patio (with our 10 month in tow) and were told they were setting up for a big party in 30-45 mins and did not have room for us.  There were no less than 10 tables open and a minimum of 40 seats open.  I will never go back.,1
Great food in the evening and great fun late nights.,5
Reserve a table if you can a with many new venues in the area this place is going! Good food and great outdoor atmosphere!,4
Me and my friend were sitting at American social around 7:00 p.m. we ordered 2 double espresso and a Bullet Mule. When we got our check we were charged 4x espressos because of the double instead of industry standard of 20%,3
The food was fantastic and it's a beautiful view.,5
Food was good but not worth the price. Service was terrible,2
"I went for lunch, waited over 35 minutes and nobody seem interested in taking my order.",1
"Our server charged us for both our bill, (that was almost $200), as well as the bill for the couple at the table next to ours. She didn't know how to void out the transaction. She said we had to wait for the other table to finish and pay. The manager wouldn't come to our table, when I tried to speak to him, he ran away and hid in the back.

Oh yeah, and earlier in the night, we watched painfully as our server tried to open a metal screw-top bottle with a corkscrew until she ran away to the bar and ask the bartender for help.",2
I had just left a concert (Twenty One Pilots) and wanted some food. The outside bar was shut down within seconds of me ordering and all TV's were shut down,2
"Went there for a Sunday brunch with my husband. The staff seems as if they didn't want to work. Our waitress doesn't possess the personality to be a waitress. They had a fix menu for brunch for $29.99, which was not worth it. The buffet was in a small room and they had 4 dishes as options. We expected more for that price. We didn't enjoy",2
"30 dollars for a dozen oysters the size of your fingernail. Poor service.. Lication is good for a few drinks, that is ir👎",2
Great place for a Friday hangout. Outside deck has an outstanding view.,4
"Was there for a catered meeting, but the food was excellent for a sports bar. Chicken and waffles, sliders...",5
This was the first restuarant we had dinner at while visiting in Tampa. The atmosphere was good. Service was okay. Food wasn't great.,2
"Great food, reasonably priced. We had brunch and everything was delicious! Short ribs are delectable and the muffin platter appetizer is fun and delicious.",5
"The best experience and food, thanks chef Freddy",5
The food and the music were good. the waitress was extreeeemely slow with bringing or tabs!! The crowd was just a little too young for me and my crew. It's more of a college social hence the name.,3
"Great food and good service but it was a bit of a wait. In all fairness, there were lots of patrons that night.",4
"Good place to eat and relax. Just don't eat the desserts there.  They are nasty, lol",4
"What a great brunch and what made everything even better was Lily amazing service! We drive from Orlando and got recommended to come here and, we got lucky to get Lily!!! She is awesome!!!",5
The atmosphere is amazing. The brisket tacos are great.,5
Good steak perfectly cooked. Fantastic pizza. Wished they did not run out of Paulander Hefe...,5
"The food is pretty good, the drinks are good, the staff is hit or miss, and the view (outside) is amazing. The vibe is a little “clubby” for my taste. But sit outside and the view redeems that. My wife and I go here every now and then and enjoy the view. We take out of town guests here too, to enjoy the view. I’d go here before Ulele.",3
Food pretty good,5
"This place has a nice view and the DJ's selections were good-that it!!  Service was horrible.  Took forever to seat our party, despite the relative emptiness.   The food was average.  I had chicken and waffles, fiancé had salmon burger (she said was ""awful"").  My dish may have tasted better if it arrived with my other party's food and not 20 minutes later (server obviously forgot to ring initially).  Overpriced for the type of experience I received.  Won't be going back.",2
"Amazing food and atmosphere, and the best views of the Bay and downtown Tampa!",5
"Food was okay, prices were high. Fries tasted great. The service was terrible, we waited over an hour for food, waited over 45 minutes to get our checks after we asked for them, many of us had wrong charges for food we bought during happy hour. The waiter had a good attitude but seemed slow. Also atmosphere was loud and poorly lit, not a fan",2
"The food was delicious, but slow to come out. Also, the restaurant was very noisy. Could not hear across the table.",3
"Fun location in downtown, great happy hour and brunch",5
"Nice place, staff was friendly,  but noticed some hustler chicks. Food was good.",4
"Mediocre drinks, I had to tell the bar tender to make my drinks doubles because they skimp so much on the alcohol. They have decent food I wasn't super impressed by it and I am an avid foodie, I solely judge a spot based on food. I will say that the Goat Cheese croquettes are amazing. Above that there is an awesome atmosphere!",3
You cannot beat the location or views.  Great bar with Americana style upscale bar food.  Mahi amazing.  Ropa Vieja tacos amazing.  Don't miss the black truffle fries.  Staff is on point and friendly.,5
"Zero complaints. Go there to enjoy the party, the drinks and a little food. There's something for everybody and the atmosphere is great. Keep it up!",5
Had a great time,5
"Stopped by to grab drinks with a friend and waited 15 minutes and no one came over to our table. They were not busy whatsoever. Oddly enough, the server in our section (?) waited on the table next to us and talked to them, but totally ignored us. After waiting with no service, we left.",1
Nice restaurant and the food was great.,4
"Great experience at American Social! Brittany M made sure we have our drinks filled at all times and recommended places and things to do around the area. Awesome food, drinks, music and view! Their AmSo sauce that comes with the burger was delicious :)!",5
"Great view from the patio. Music was good but wait service outside ended before the kitchen closed so we had to order food from the bar which was a long process. However, all the employees we encountered were super nice including security.",3
"Place is loud. Beer selection ok. Food that I had was not good. Got the grouper fingers and cheeks. Tasted more like fingers and toes. Came with some funky tarter sauce. Also ordered bourbon bbq wings. Very dry. Suppose to come with blue cheese vinaigrette, whatever that is. Had to ask for it. Watery blue cheese. The Cole slaw was dry also. Nice looking people.",3
"We enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. Recommend it to all!",5
Sit at the outside bar.  Great vibe and view of the area.,5
Fantastic club sandwich and delicious peel and eat shrimp for lunch!,5
Food & service very good. The outdoor dining area was also nice.,4
"This place has a great view and awesome atmosphere. Go in an see Alyssa, great bartender and so adorable!",5
"Carla, the Marketing & Events Manager, Mike and Joshua did an awesome job helping our team celebrate the Holidays. 5 Stars!!!",5
Great happy hour place... Monday half price beers and $5 burgers,4
so much fun there when there with my big group. more young age. nice view next to Jackson.,5
"We re here every Wednesday to leave the day behind! Such an amazing outdoor atmosphere facing the river, cheering to happiness!",5
"Love amso i come here frequently. Great views gorgeous, place and good music.",5
"What a great place. However it gets much different at night. Not bad. Just not my style. So let me explain.

Went with both my kids(1 & 5) and was greeted  and seated with high chair. Normal stuff. Met some other family there so we had 5 in our party nothing crazy. Waitress was on everything super friendly and made things happen for my picky eaters. So much that my son didnt like the mac and cheese (1 y/o) and she said shed take it off. Told her she did not have to it's not her or the cooks fault it's just my picky 1 year old. She still took it off. Super nice. So nice we came back with another group the following night for dinner. Experience was almost identical. Great staff.

Now. After about 9ish the place gets weird. Lol tables go away and the music gets louder. It is a club. Security checks. And dancing type club. Again. It's great. If that's your scene. Just not a mid 30 with kids vibe after 9ish. We had fun. But it's worth knowing knowing that the gremlin gets wet things change.

All in great place. Just different vibes. Food is amazing. Staff is awesome. Highly recommend.",5
"Love this place, but Outside Bartenders needs to be nicer with customers, a smile is a big door for everything",4
Happy hour is available til 7pm with really good offers. Nice views of the the city skyline.,4
"Went to American social today for what we thought a nice dinner on the water. It was about 4.30 PM, we walked up to the front desk and asked for a table for 2. They told us that the menu isn’t the full menu between 4-5PM (which was fine for us)
My girlfriend then asked for a vegetarian option as she is a vegetarian. The front desk lady then told my girlfriend, in a really unfriendly way, that American social does not have any vegetarian  options!
We go to steakhouses and all other restaurents and the staff is always really helpful to make something happen for a vegetarian.
Customer obsession = 0 at American social, we left and went to dinner somewhere else as the front desk lady, as said before, wasn’t really friendly nor helpful at all.
We were really surprised and upset as we were really looking forward to a nice dinner.",1
Great atmosphere both inside area and outside. The food was good and service was great.,4
"Awesome Management,People Person, Upscale, The Chefs are good at what they do best. Delicious food and Bar.Location is in SouthHarbour Island,Downtown Tampa,Fl.
The Ideal Place for breakfast,dinner, lunch and night life at it's best.",5
"Obnoxiously loud music, and a bunch of beer swilling, shouting patrons (may wanna consider catering to customers that can pay their tab without parents' cc)...No thanks. So many other better options in Tampa/Harbor island area.",1
"Great spot, prime location on the water. Outdoor area is nice as well, but the service is AWFUL!!! Figured, new restaurant and they’d eventually work all the of kinks out, but it’s still terrible. Management, you should probably have a customer service training for your bartenders. There will be drunk people, it’s a bar, but don’t be a prick to those who’ve done nothing but ask for a drink, that’s what we’re all there for...",2
Great environment.  Fun crowd and great dj,5
"If you drink a little too much and decide to be responsible and leave your car in their garage overnight to avoid a dui, it'll cost you $107.",2
Good food and service. Average pricing. Trendy Miami vibe. A little noisy but to be expected with this type of restaurant.,5
Sure would like to make a reservation. I’ve been on hold over 15 minutes (it’s 3 pm) and no one even said hello. Just “hold please.” Hanging up now.,2
"The food is over priced and ok at best.  I ordered the salmon burger and was not impressed.  There’s more bun than salmon. The sweet potato fries were cold.  The female bartender around lunch time is extremely rude and unprofessional.  Needless to say, I will eat at my hotel the next time I’m on business in Tampa.",1
Our building was invited by American Social for happy hour.  They were not prepared for our group at all and shoved us in a tiny triangle of space. The hors d'oeuvres came out late and they didn't have the drink tickets ready.  The hors d'oeuvres were bland.  Not a great representation of this restaurant.  Plus it was extremely noisy.  We left early and went next door to Jackson's for dinner which was a 10.,2
"Food was decent, but it took around 40 minutes to be made and came out staggered across a further ten minutes. Two members of my party left without food because it took so long and everyone else was finished eating before their food arrived.",2
"Service was terrible, food and drinks never delivered, nothing but college kids. Spend your money elsewhere.",1
Love the music and the overall ambiance of the place. The music caters to everyone!! great place to hang out with the girls or guys on a Friday night!!,4
"Although the crowd is nice to be around, the business process is horrible. Waited for an hour for a table while 3 tables remained empty the entire time. Their response when asked was that they are reserved for a time that was 2 hours from right then so they won't give it up. Horrible business.",2
10 Stars For Dillon! He Was Awesome!!! The Food Was Great.,5
"Nice view of the water, fun atmosphere, good food, the drinks were pretty tasty. We were seated pretty quickly and our server was chill.",5
"Love this place!!!! Ashley is an amazing bartender!!!! For a great time, hit this place up on Friday and Saturday nights",5
"Great experience, we just happened upon it on $5.00 burger Monday. Burgers perfectly done and tasty.",5
"Great location on Harbor Island, overlooking the convention center and the Hillsborough River.  The Happy Hour hors d'oeuvres, especially the chicken and hamburger sliders, were great. Mixed drinks were amply portioned. I would definitely go back again.",4
"It’s a great place to go have cocktails on a Saturday night, it has an amazing view and located in one of the prime spots in Tampa. HOWEVER, to get inside they mark you with a black stamp and my dress got all stained  Bc it was light colored, very disappointing. Also, it was too hot inside, I don’t think they turned on the AC at all, which doesn’t make sense Bc if people get hot they don’t buy drinks other than beer which is the cheapest one...I was just imposible to stay inside for more than 15 minutes tbh.",4
A bit pricey for drinks and food but if you hit up the happy hour much better,4
The atmosphere was wonderful! I'm from Jacksonville Florida and have no problem coming back!,5
"Great view, very clean, good drink selection and cool setup. The food is okay and the service often takes a while even when not very busy.",4
"Food was awesome, service not so much",4
"Nice late night bar for social mixer with friends and to make new friends. Good service, friendly staff, clean and classy.",4
Nice and elegant place to grab Sunday brunch! The service was a bit slow at first. The food and drinks are great here! It definitely has an enjoyable atmosphere for everyone!,4
"Great atmosphere, servers and bartenders - also had one of the best pieces of chocolate cake that I had in a while. Ask for Lily the bartender and tell her to just give tou the dang cake already.",5
Delicious and unique menu.  Delicious small plates for sharing.,5
Too expensive for what you get,3
"Great atmosphere, good food, beautiful location",4
Good drinks and great view. Will not be returning for the food. It was like they premade the day before and threw it in the microwave. I ordered the pork belly empanadas and did not locate any pork belly. Disappointing as I had high hopes.,2
"Ambience, location, drinks and staff we're all great. Wasn't blown away by my lunch but would try something else.",4
My favorite brunch spot in tampa. Good is amazing,5
Place is nice but super busy with college students. Due to that the bartender aren’t too quick but it’s an ok to hangout at,2
"Great atmosphere! Particularly when football games are on. Drinks are great, food acceptable!",4
This place is huge. Great spot right on Davis Island overlooking Downtown Tampa. Music is good and ambience is spot on.,5
Great place to visit! Nice views good food cold drinks. Elite atmosphere,5
Great place to eat. Will come back when we visit Tampa again.,4
"The Mahi Tacos were delicious, the service was great and the outdoor bar makes for some great views!",5
Great waterside atmosphere with good food and many large TVs available for sports.,5
Great wings and the artichoke dip is the best.  Cheeseburger is dripping with slap your mama goodness....,5
"For the premium price, the service certainly was terrible. The only thing saving this place is that the food is slightly above average. Good burger and fries but the incredibly loud music makes conversation next to impossible.

These 3 entrees, and 3 drinks each (total of 9) set us back nearly $200 with tip.

Save your money and skip this place. There's too many other places in the area to choose.",2
"Good food, good view. Nice for mid-day bite and drink.",4
Salmon burgers lunch special 👍🏾,3
My burger was undercooked and the Ropa Vieja tacos tasted horribly. Our drinks were not made right and were difficult to consume,1
"Went during the ""club""hours. It was a really nice scene to hangout on a Saturday night. Parking is hassle tho",4
"Average chain ,good service but not much variety on the menu but clean and I here more lively than the Wednesday note we were there on Friday, Saturday, Sunday.",3
Was there for a training. We were offered 3 appetizers & cocktails. Food was tasty and service was friendly,5
Amazing accommodating staff thank you for making our team feel welcomed and well taken care of!,4
"Modern American interesting and excellently prepared fresh food. Good, highly energetic restaurant!",5
Awesome place! Dominic was an awesome server and we had a great time!,5
"Friday:
Frou frou is expected but, the ADHD DJ (bless his heart) is Frustrating when he switches mid-tempo every 45 seconds. You can't even enjoy the song and it's a new one at a different BPM. Geez. The people who DO want to dance get cut off mid-move. Oof.
It's bad enough the people who show up try too hard.
Relax, bro.",3
Music is ok could definitely be better. Staff is ok it can be very busy sometimes so they do have a lot of pressure on them and they get to customers as quickly and as efficiently as possible.,4
"Food is ok. It’s a bar that wants badly to be taken seriously as a restaurant. Fun vibe, but food is nothing to write home about.",4
I love this Restaurant,5
The food is just average but way overpriced. The staff is not friendly. Poor service from a waitress we barely saw. Dinner took 2.5 hours. Would not recommend.,1
"American Social was free to get in awesome! But you paid the price walking through those doors. The bar, is the main topic... Not only did I order the same 3 drinks at each bar but every time the drinks were different prices (inside and outside) and one transaction the bartender added tips $9.00 when I gave them cash...who the hell thinks that's professional??? I hope your reading this American Social!!! This  appears to look nice but robs you blindly.
The flip side, my creditors credited my account and placed a dispute...besides that I have all my copies and know what I spent...how dare they work and steal from their customers. Tisk Tisk!",1
Good food but the music is too loud! You have to shout to be heard by the person sitting next to you.  Music doesn't have to be that loud!,3
"Food was good, atmosphere wasgood. Outside bar was a little busy and bartenders where not working well together. Guy next to me wait for 15-20 minites to be waited on when the bartenders kept walking back and forth past him.",4
"Love this place.  Great atmosphere, food and drinks.",5
I spent 150$ at this establishment just to be treated like trash by the staff. We was having dinner and a few drinks with friends and one of my friends went to their car to get their phone charger and they refused to let them back in unless they went through the whole waiting in line thing again........... We've been there since 830 and this happened at 1130,1
Had a great time a little more classy then the clubs I'm use to but it was an easy adjustment,5
$9 for a water-down bottom-shelf vodka soda? Maybe if the environment was amazing but it isnt. It's way too loud to have a normal conversation below shouting level. The bartenders had to be flagged down repeatedly even though the bar area was empty except for us. I've been there 3 times and had an unpleasant experience each time. I wont return.,1
Enjoyed our experience they're very friendly staff food was very good thanks again,4
"If I told the bartender I just docked my boat and I want a fruity boat drink I don't expect it to take a half an hour to get something weak, made with Savory herbs better intended for something at a wine tasting in Napa Valley.",2
"All the new craze, craft drinks. They're fun, but overpriced. I went for a Ketel One promo & there was no real promo, just one free drink, which was nice. I was expecting some promo prizes or something. No dance floor, but really cool DJ spinning some oldies jams. Guess u just have to wiggle in ur seat. There's an outdoors bar & seating area where u can see Tampa Bay downtown. At night its very nice all lit up. Parking fees are outrageous in the parking garage & nowhere does it tell u the cost before u park.",3
Great service and good food.,4
"Pretty small menu with decent food, a little slow on service though",4
"Service was very slow and staff  seemed
as if we were an inconvenience to them.",1
Amazing view with great food and service.,5
"First trip was good, second trip was great.Third trip was bad. Mgt made it up by buying our lunch, but seemed as if they had no idea the Final four was here....",1
"Great vibe,  nice environment on the river,  extremely large space with good food and drinks",4
"Nice chill place to gather a group and eat, or hangout. Hip , down to earth feel.",4
"I live down the street on Harbor Island so this place is really close by.

I am going to rate this a 1 star because out of all the personnel only one young Asian girl bartender and one french male bartender whose name i cant remember are actually worth going to and getting your drinks and food from!

I've been here at different times of the day. So, far most of the servers and bartenders I've had either pour you the wrong beer on tap! or forget to check on your table. Or completely ignore you at the bar as they chit chat and flirt with their coworkers. My biggest issue is those bad employs not being proactive in attending to the patrons. If you have time to chit chat, you have time to serve and attend to the customers.

Recently Ive been served by the french young man who did really great despite of how busy it was.

I would recommend him and the young Asian girl bartender  i think her name was Layly?

I would rate higher but I'm sorry most of your employs suck. My wife feels the same way.

I hope more employs start doing well because the location is beautiful so i hope the service can follow.",1
Great spot for a quick dinner and drink before a Lightning game or concert.,5
"Great service even though they were extremely busy, food was even better",5
Nice place to get drinks.  Food a little bit too expensive for the amount you get,5
"Sever in dining area was great, but bartenders only seemed less than interested in assisting. They were more interested in socializing.",4
"Slow but polite service, bad food, over priced for what is offered, and overpriced drinks.",2
Was in town visiting a friend and stopped through for Sunday football action. Excellent sports bar if you're trying to find all the NFL games on at once for fantasy football reasons.,5
"Service was slow, burger was over cooked. not my best meal, but wasn't horrible either.",2
One of the best sports bars in Tampa. Great place to watch the game and food is actually good too,5
"Omg so much fun R
m
Marly waitress such a sweet girl on top of everything and fun to deal with thank you that make a great sunday brunch thank u",5
Drinks good. Food not my personal favorite. Everyone nice.,4
Great vibe. I'll definitely be back for another experience,5
Crowded and pretentious singles club for wealthy and people who want seem wealthy. Over priced drinks and average bar service. Valet parking is expensive. Food is served but I did not try. Would not revisit,2
Good food but prices are a little on the high side.,4
"This place is classy, great views, great music, lots of space to hangout with a bunch of friends, I love it",5
Fabulous. Wonderful raw bar! A great place to have fun!!,5
Food was good. Nice atmosphere. On the water.,4
Beautiful views and very accommodating staff. The brunch was a bit unseasoned but overall good experience.,4
Great food and service outside bar,5
Very nice place dine. The food and service were good and view is really.,4
Love this place. Great to hang out and talk or grab food n drinks.,5
Very slow service. Waited 30 minutes before server even acknowledged us.,2
"Long wait to start. Bartending staff shorts you on drink quantity, pretty rude, bad attitude. There's better places in Tampa to spend your money rather than be overcharged here and treated like you don't matter. Won't waste my money here again.",2
Great food at a mid level price.,5
"This location in Tampa is hands down my favorite of all AmSo locations...superb!  I was nervous taking my best friend here for part of his bachelor party festivities but what a relief when this place was NOTHING like the Ft Lauderdale location...and yes, that's a good thing!  Such a beautiful and well put together venue.  Kudos to mgmt on this one!",5
Nice place by the side of water canal and accessible by Yacht.,5
Really enjoyed eating here. Highly recommend,5
It's loud music and Sunday brunch was full of young intoxicated people. The hostess station was a mess. My friend and I were told 45 minute wait. Her husband walks up separately and suddenly a table is available. Very disorganized.,3
"Amazing views, great atmosphere and outstanding service!!",5
Great experience,5
Great in the evening if you are 21. This was not for 30 somethings.,3
Awesome place to catch the game and enjoy a cold one.,4
Great dinner.,5
Good service in spite of how crazy busy they were when we visited! Try the lobster tacos!,5
Great view of the city!!,4
"Quality of meat was disappointing.  Ordered  steak fritas, medium rare, cooked to temp, but very tough and chewy.  Good beer selection and decor, nice staff, just poor quality meat (at least this night).",3
"Very nice place for dinner with  beautiful scenery.  Or to hang out, have drinks, dance, or watch a game.  The food was fantastic!",5
Amazing place. I always avoided going there because I assumed the cost was $$$. But we (me and my GF) went and got a $5 burger and a couple beers and got out of their for under $15 each.,5
Music here is always way too loud. I think people come for the view and to socialize not really for the food. Thay being said I am vegan so options were pretty limited for me to try.,3
Decently priced drinks and space inside and out. My only complaint is how hot the patio is at night so more fans or misters would be amazing.,5
"Staff was very polite, crowd was a bit young, but good music.",3
Nice atmosphere and waterfront view. Not many selections of dark beers. The glare and reflection of the sun in the water was uncomfortable but manageable. Overall good experience.,4
"Great atmosphere- much needed in Tampa! They are working through some things with service, but the food was solid and drinks were good. Better than any other sports bar in Tampa.",5
"Food is way over priced. Currently it's a trendy place to go for night life. Bring your ""A"" game and a full wallet.",3
Long wait but delicious food and the servers are very attentive,5
"Food looks great but is lacking for the price, great place for drinks!",4
"Nice setting, friendly staff, food lacking in flavor, had fish fry,and  cobb salad, wasn't terrible but doesn't warranty a 2 nd trip, other places real close by so much better. But the view is great.",3
bar food and service at this spot is very good. i look forward to a return visit.,5
My mahi sandwich was very good along with great drinks and service.,5
Food was delicious.  Would recommend to a friend.,4
Great service Great environment will def go back,5
Attended a lunch event. Hostess had no clue who our 50 person group was or if we were even there. Eventually found on our own. Lunch was late. No utensils overall poor service. Management totally unprepared for convention business but should have known better.,1
"Owners are wonderful people, food is absolutely delish, and atmosphere is great.",5
Great place my first time will go back again,4
Friendly staff.  Upbeat atmosphere and good drinks.  Didn't get into any of the food.  Maybe next time.,4
Amazing downtown and water views... Plus great Food!,5
Cool trendy spot. The food was decent and the scenery is awrsome.,4
"What more is there to say beyond WOW. I would give ten stars if I could! How fantastic is American social? Let me count the ways.
Let’s begin with the ambiance. American social has one of the most prime locations in all of tampa bay! Nestled right along the water their restaurant offers a spacious and relaxing patio as well as gorgeous views from the chic indoor dining rooms. It was impeccably clean, we enjoyed the music, the bathrooms were nice, etc. I could go on!
When it comes to service- we were blown away. The hostess greeted us with a big smile and conversation. We had to wait a few minutes, but what do you expect at such a gorgeous restaurant?! We decided to grab a drink at the bar while they prepared a table.
The bartender was kind and helpful, and guided us to the perfect drinks for each of our tastes. The blueberry bliss drink was amazing! Just the right amount of sweetness, highly recommend.
Once we got to our table our sever promptly refreshed our drinks and gave us a warm welcome. She answered all of our questions and helped us select our entrees. She was attentive, kind, and friendly. One of the best we’ve ever had! We had the salmon and the mahi sandwich and the worst part of the meal was simply the argument we had over whose was better!
During our meal the manager came by to check on us, which was so kind. He was caring, warm, and you could tell he really loved his job.
The price point for such an enjoyable meal wasn’t nearly enough. We couldn’t be more thrilled that we tried American social for dinner; we will most DEFINITELY be their newest loyal customers!!! Bravo!",5
Great atmosphere . Staff is excellent and drinks as well !! Two thumbs up from me.,5
"Beautiful, great service and an outstanding beer selection",5
The food was great! And Asia our server was amazing!,5
Great place to go on a Saturday night. Meet really awesome people and the staff was great too!,5
"I'd give it another few months for American Social to get past the growing pains. We came in for a late lunch and were told it would be a 15 min wait to be seated outside. After 25 min I asked the hostess what was up and she said the previous hostess didn't put us in the computer at all. 2:30/3PM on Friday is shift change time and we fell through the cracks on numerous occasions.

I'll be back for the view and the cocktails - good happy hour prices on drinks.",3
"Great location during the day,  night life can be hit or miss.  Specials are quite good value.",5
Pricey and food was good but their brunch doesn't have much selections for the high price.,3
Great food service and prices with the best views!,5
Nice place. Great location.,4
"Food was great!  Service was a bit slow but,  I figure the staff was tired from Gasparilla.",4
"Great fun, best bartender Alyssa makes a great old fashion!",5
"Cool place, service was pretty good considering it was crazy busy with the game. The food... meh. It was just uneventful.. More typical than what I expected.",3
"Great location. Expensive appetizers but ok. Waitress was scattered. No silverware. Had to keep asking for normal stuff. Music no good on friday if you like hip hop or soul, thats saturday i heard. Beautiful water front.",5
Great place to hang just tends to get very crowded once it gets late. But if you don't mind a crowd this is definitely a go to bar for downtown tampa!,4
Great food and a friendly staff. Highly recommend.,5
The music was great and the staff very friendly.want to go back again,5
Beautiful view great music great service definitely will be returning.,5
"Great view but no brunch for me; if you want eggs with no meat, you have to spend $30 on the buffet....uh no. Won’t be back for brunch. As a side note, my expensive mimosa was mostly OJ.",2
Have tried most of the menu. Food is very underwhelming. Great atmosphere for sunset and early evening. Fades as the night goes on. Move to your next spot by 10:30ish.,3
"No entrance fee  so it tends to get super packed on Saturdays!Located in
Harbor island it had Nice view of the city by the water. It's a chill vibing spot . Two dj one inside and one out by the patio!",5
"Good atmosphere, great price on happy hour drinks, but the food is meh.",4
I was underwhelmed by the food and the service was decent but subpar.,2
"Very crowded on the weekend, so it was hard to get the bartenders attention. Otherwise it was a fun time.",3
"Great breakfast at a reasonable price. Watch out for the bottomless mimosas, they ruined my girlfriend, too good to resist.",5
"Nice atmosphere, mixed crowd, good music, good food.",4
Great food and great service.,5
Nice bar/ restaurant right on the water. Prices were a bit expensive but considering the location it wasn't bad,5
Great happy hour prices!  --great atmosphere and prices we went from work for happy hour on a Monday.,5
"Pleasantly surprised! I didn't have many expectations for American Social, it seemed like the other 100 American style porkbelly, shrimp with grits, and steak and fries type joints. Where do I start? Breakfast pizza was off the charts good, they are probably making their own dough, which is crispy with a very nice bite. The bacon, sausage, and eggs is a killer combo. The only thing I regret is not trying the cheese sauce instead of the tomato like the server suggested. We also got the porkbelly benedict, the #1 suggestion of our server. It was very good, the pork belly is cooked so it's not rubbery or ""blubbery"" as some say. They have ladies mamosas at brunch for free, so the girls love that. Great place, I will be back.",5
It was ok. Lots of tv screens. Music could be better. Bartender are very nice.,3
"Good food, nice atmosphere... attentive staff",5
Went for a late lunch. The music was overwhelmingly loud. Service kinda so so. If your young deaf and want a crowd this is the way to go :-),3
"Food and experience we're good, but $16 for a burger is a bit much",4
Atmosphere is awesome. Food is good. Service is acceptable.,4
Las Olas store in FTL far more superior. Too Big to get the real experience of a Great concept.,1
Great place to meet friends and hang. View is #happyhour #drinkoutside #eatoutside fabulous when you dine outside,5
Beautiful waterfront and great service! Will definitely be back again.,5
Great location overlooking downtown Tampa.  Plenty of outdoor seating.,5
"Trendy bar restaurant turns into a nightclub after 10 food is good nice tap selection. usually overcrowded and overpriced. like I said the food is good but not great. If you're not on a budget and want to be seen this is your place. I suggest uber / lift if u live in South Tampa cuz the parking will cost you more than a uber ride. This Is Not a Hipster Place, South Tampa money people only. If you show up trim that nasty beard and leave your vaping device in your car or Vespa.😁",4
Food was good. Go on monday to avoid overpaying. Dont expect anything quickly. Best avoid if you have a limited break for lunch.,4
Good food. Great view.,5
"Fun spot on the Riverwalk, good happy hour",4
"I would go for Zero Stars if i could. Were to start. Went to the hockey game on 01/19/19. Went to A.S once the game was over. Had 2 friends who the left game early and were already there on the patio near bar #2 . They had their own tab and we asked to start one too, ordered 3 tall Capt and diets and a pepperoni pizza. We got our drinks in good time but never saw our waitress again but once about 40min later after asking about the pizza that never came. About another 40min went by and still no pizza and never asked us for drinks again. It is now about 1.5hrs after we ordered. I get fed up and go to the bar and ask her for our tab of 3 drinks and we dont want the pizza now, she looks at me like a deer in head lights and say ok while taking a drink order to my right as well. She gives me the entire tab for my buddy and his wife too who were there for about 30-40min before us and had a few beers and food too (a pizza and pretzels). I asked again if she can just do the Captians for me and my tab, nothing.....then says ""but thats your tab"". I have had enough and pay the whole thing ($104.16 chk# 4515 for the manager if you read this at 9:58pm). I still tip her $20 and we arr about to go. She comes over to the table and hands my buddy the same check and said ""you never paid your bill"". We explain we did and show her that i took carr of it, she says ""ok sorry for the crazy night"". Well my buddy calls me this morning (01/20/19) and sure enough she ran his CC for the bill too. WTF, this is the worse service and staffing i have ever seen. It is hard to fathom it is an actual business.",1
Great atmosphere. Also In a great location with good parking.,5
"Great atmosphere, food, and service!!",5
"Great place, nice view. Good food and drink",4
This is a great lunch spot we visited while attending a conference at the Westin Hotel.,5
First time here..really bad experience..cold  food..long wait..harrassed and verbally attacked by a table of 10 college students about my friend smoking..when asked for a manager..he didn't really take care of the problem..when I stated I felt unsafe there..he basically offered to pay for my meal..which was horrible to begin with..as I was leaving those same men started harassing a table of young ladies with rude and offensive comments. Way to lose business American Social.,1
"Great atmosphere, GREAT FOOD, and Awesome view!",5
Awesome! Nice view and Service,5
Best mac n cheese around! Adorable bartenders with great conversations and great drink choices! We will be coming back for sure!,5
I was here during Gasparilla. I did not get to try the food. The patio is AWESOME though with plenty of room.,4
No Cognac. Nice spot thought.,3
"Nightlife on point, brunch.... Issa NO. My $17 shrimp and arugula salad had baby shrimp and a tear jerking thick layer of Cajun seasoning on them. Endless mimosas should be called rationed mimosas, I felt like they purposely were giving only one pitcher at a time for 8 ppl smh!",3
Such a great atomosphere!  Can't wait to come back.,5
Way too loud. Why does a restaurant need nightclub music. Our server disappeared. Never even got to order the expensive limited menu.,1
Meh... definitely overrated.... something to do but I would love to see them switch up the menu... taste of the food is def not worth the price... but the vibe is Chill minus the pretentious consumers who seemed to be the standard type of people they appeal to,3
"Meh. Food and drinks are ok but nothing spectacular, imo subpart for price point. The atmosphere gives good vibes but it seems their DJs are very inexperienced, they often kill the mood by drastically changing music style, and not paying attention to the crowd feedback.",3
"Contempoary, nice place.  Fun.",4
"KEWL ATMOSPHERE, GOOD PUB GRUB & Drinks.",4
"Love the vibes, I will drive 2hrs to Tampa any time",5
Crystal took great care of us!!,5
Great spot! Good food and drinks with a fantastic view of the bay. Prices are high.,4
Great drinks. Very cool atmosphere,5
Food was great. Outdoor patio is awesome,5
Pasta not fresh. Good service. Good shrimp,4
"The waitress Danielle, had to be reminded what unlimited meant with the mamosa's. That means keep them coming.
ALL of the food was cold. Friend of my party ordered eggs benedict, and it wasn't even made to completion. What the holy hell!! American Social for brunch? No thanks! All that expensive food, I can cook in my house for free. American Social for dinner? Do we have to? There's a Taco Bell down the block, and we can save the gas 🤔",1
Great atmosphere and  vibe...definitely recommended,5
"Don't bother. The menu was very very limited and overpriced, and not even with good choices either. It took about 40 mins to get our food and it wasn't even correct when it came! The waitress, nice as she was, needs a lot of training. Our table came in pairs. She'd take one order and totally disregard the other new comers, until she returned, 5-10 mins later. The manager was lacking in making the patrons feel like they were valued. Totally disregarded our complaints of service. Response: ""Well looks like you're all enjoying your food now."" Well after 40 mins waiting you'd be too! If we sent it back we might never eat! One person was missing a muffin or something, they took the whole meal back! Why?!?!? Brought it back out 5 mins later, cold and without the missing item. Waffle/Pancakes brought out with syrup. The only good thing I can say about this place was the location. Other than than, literally nothing.",1
"Nothing positive to post about this poor hipster wannabe ""South Beach"" restaurant/bar, except the awesome location & riverfront views in downtown Tampa. This was my 4th visit to American Social, & each time has been a worse experience. Horrible & bland food from the oily quesadillas, to the luke warm & drenched in sauce chicken wings, to the tasteless & dry burgers. Watered down cocktails, a totally disinterested & inattentive staff, drunk & rude patrons stumbling around the place. Additionally, add in way too loud music, & unless all you care about is hanging out with Millennial hipsters, & checking out young women showing lots of cleavage & caked in make up, & dudes that spend half their lives flexing in mirrors, there is zero reason to patronize this beautifully packaged, but nothing under the hood, overhyped, overpriced, & underwhelming establishment. Don't waste your time or money.",1
"Service, food and atmosphere was great.",5
"Food is amazing, but not the best customer service experience. The server almost walked past, and ignored several times.",4
Very nice people and environment. I'd recommend it highly.,5
Overpriced everything. Weak drinks and lame beer selections. View is nice and that's about it. Service is spotty at best. Stick with Jackson's.,1
Not very good service or food but great party bar with nice view,3
"Good food, and location. Service, not so good",4
Spacious and great water view from the outdoor terrasse.,4
Very upscale large restaurant Bar & Patio Bar lots of servers fine cuisine,5
"Well, it is popular with the 30 somethings,  pricey and measured pours. Service staff did a good job, as long as you are drinking adult beverages. Limited beers, full bar, and ok food. Parking is valadated.",3
Great outdoor seating and good food,4
Best breakfast I've ever had.  Neat atmosphere.,5
Way to expensive for the quality of food not worth it!,1
Lots of space. Good atmosphere.,4
"Great place to meet friends for happy hour. The view is amazing, right on the water.",5
Monday burger special is the way to go!,5
"Good place for drinks and atmosphere
..food not so much total disappointed especially for the price point, they need to step up their game.",3
Awesome 👍,5
"Very hip and beautiful view of bay, but food is on the high side for upscale bar food",4
"The menu is extremely limited. I ended up ordering the salmon burger at the server's suggestion. It was bland, dry and crumbly... really gross. I could only manage a few bites before calling it quits. It's also deafening loud inside. I left hungry and with a massive headache.",1
"Decent food, nothing to brag about, excellent selection of beers and wine. Bring your ear plugs...I've been to concerts that weren't as loud as this place...people sitting right next to you literally have to scream to be heard.",3
Never been there early but the music is great after 11pm on fridays. there's plenty of space especially outdoors,4
Very disappointing. Not a place for a private event! They don’t take it seriously. Unprofessional. Bad service. Lack of attention to everything. Food is nothing special.,1
"Food was great but took an hr and a half. Very loud, not for kids after 6. Very S. TAMPA crowd",3
cold beer. great scrnery,5
Very mediocre at best.,2
"Great time, beautiful place! The service was awesome.",5
Excellent location. good service and nice place,5
Ambience smooth as hell!,5
Great food and atmosphere. Must try the chicken and waffles.,5
Entire wait and hostess staff was completely rude.  I literally was asked to leave for sitting down in an empty table outside because I was not sat by a hostess.  I guess I'm not good enough to eat or drink here.,1
"Great environment for groups and group meetings. Staff was awesome, thank you to Will.",5
"Just had drinks, but a nice place to sit outside and enjoy the river",5
Great Happy hour & view! 👍,5
Nice place.  But too crowded. Getting a drink was tough.,3
"This is a good place for hungover Generation Ys with more money than sense. The service is pretty terrible, the first hostess told us to go see the hostess outside, who is on her phone when we get there and just stares at us with this blank glare. We say “we’d like a table”. She says “high top or low top?” We say “low top”. She says “there’s one high top left but you’ll have to leave by noon for a private party.” Then the another hostess walks up and asks “where do you wanna sit” so we say “a low top” and she says “Ok but you have to get out by 2”...
Waitress forgot our drinks and interrupted conversations, didn’t check on us, food was nothing special, especially for the ridiculous prices. Terrible terrible terrible.",1
Long wait and mediocre food.  The mahi tacos were fishy tasting as hell and low on meat content.  I think they may have substituted tilapia or swai.,3
"Good drinks, innovative to compete with the increasing “craft culture.” Good atmosphere and views. Service was slower than average and didn’t seem to have a good knowledge of the menu.",4
Food was great.  Friendly staff.,5
"Great service from Krystal, and a really fantastic margarita. The waterfront view is amazing.",5
If you looking for a place to socialize enjoy drinks and meet people this would be the spot,5
We all have fun and great music !!!!! Happy Friday night LOL love weekend,4
Great food and open later then other restaurants in the area.,5
Nice place good atmosphere pricey though great view,5
"Good ambience, nice people, and ok service. Very busy and overpriced but good if you don't mind loud places, want to watch sports, or party with friends having a water view.",4
Super fun place to watch the Lightning games. Drinks are good.,5
Food is ok the view is great,3
Great drinks. Good atmosphere,5
"Nice place to stay, eat and have some drinks. It is a little pricely specially the parking",4
"The bar staff especially one was very friendly and acknowledgeable. The food was ok, for the price I expected more from the bbq wings, I tried them at a cook at Curtis Hixon and they were delicious then but now, just ok and the presentation is under stated. We sat at a table at the bar and we were told we had to move, there was no reserved sign at the table nor a hostess to inform us that we had to go back inside the building to be seated at the bar outside where we were there for a outside event. So regardless of event don't forget to check inside with the hostess for a table regardless of its location. The location is nice and parking is validated.",3
"The service was great, food was really good.",5
"Great place, nice setting on the water with outdoor and indoor seating, beer menu was good, food menu had a good variety, bar tenders made really solid drinks, wait staff was friendly and responsive, my wife enjoyed the Ropa Vieja Tacos and i enjoyed my salmon burger when it eventually arrived.",4
Me and my wife and a few of our family and there spouses went there on a Saturday night we are all 50 plus they ID alll of us and dammed near stripped searched us guys of we are black as we stood bi and watch them not ID the younger white ppl they do have a few blacks working there but it’s pretty evident they don’t want blacks there period!!!,1
Good food and great location. Plenty of TVs as well.,5
"Food, view, and service by Stephanie was amazing.",5
Love this place. My Absolute fav when I visit Tampa,5
"Great food, great atmosphere and most of all great people.",5
Classy... nice women there too :),5
"Love the vibe at this place.  Great atmosphere with a nice view of the waterfront by the Tampa convention center.  Quality food, but prices tend towards the high side.",4
"Place is going to change Tampa forever and usher in a new era of this city. Hands down the best brunch, lunch, dinner and nightlife spot in the history of Tampa.",5
Very bad food...all my 5 people company didn't like it at all...there was also an hair on my sandwich... disgusting experience,2
"Ok lets start with the positives before this review takes a dive
1. Location and view-stunning view,  so for 2 min when peering outside , youll enjoy that
2. Friendly staff full of hot girls- if youre into that sort of thing
Ok now for everything else.....
I attended brunch and it was incredibly overpriced for what was actually served. $50 got me 2 glasses of champagne and an iced cold egg dish. An Acai bowl was ordered on another tab and was very small and not fully blended (frozen fruit chunks still left throughout)....for $13 get yourself a real juice bowl elsewhere. Other options included a $21.50 egg bar with 3 whole metal bins for selecting sides and fillings! (Inserted sarcasm)...
The decor was...new. reminiscent of every corporate pub in your nearest airport. Large, clean, kind of cool, but the ""i swear this place ______ is decorated EXACTLY the same as this"". I can further complain about the absurdity of having a BATHROOM attendant like im at a club and the awful DJ ruining our table convo,  but ill spare the details.
In short, if you prefer good food,  possibly fresh choices,  dont go here. This place is exclusively for those who are into the hot new spot regardless of experience",2
We had to wait over 30 minutes in line to get in and this place was not even full. Disappointed. We won’t be back. Absolutely overrated!,1
Excellent food great atmosphere and staff,5
The music is on point,5
Great place to a burger. Staff very freindly.,4
Poor service... very loud... expensive. Food was good but service was horrible!  Don't know why this place was so busy!,2
"Customer service is horrible, starting with the hostess and ending with the manager. You’d think they’d care but they make sure you know, they don’t.",1
"Cool place, lots of beer selections; it's tampa so don't expect the friendliest staff or patrons.",3
"Food is just okay.  Drinks are great.  Service is so/so, nothing that special about this place.",3
Nice place to take guests that are visiting 😀,4
"The name says it all, once the party starts it's socializing time. Loud music, many people.. Lots of drunk people. Food pricing is waaay over priced than what it should be. The $15 burger is nothing worth $15 and drinks are overpriced as well.",3
"The view is great, and the decor and layout of the restaurant is very cool, with lots of tvs and several big bars. I definitely pre judged the restaurant because its the ""new hip place to be"" but the staff was really nice/friendly. Ordered the chicken quesadilla to share cuz the server said it was more filling. It was ok, the refried black beans kinda took over the dish and you couldnt taste the other components very clearly. Good, but for $15 i was hoping for delicious. Dishes other people ordered looked and smelled great though, I'll def go back to try the short rib mac n cheese or ropa vieja tacos.",4
"Nice place, drink prices arent bad, half off on happy hour.",3
This place has great djs.,5
It was so popular that it was to noisey for me... I'm over 60.,4
"We had a great server, and all the food was good.",4
"Great addition to Harbour Island. Open air, nice view.",4
"The service was great, so I will give it a 2, but the food was awful. I thought I was picky, but other people in our large party agreed.

First oddity was that you couldn't make changes like ordering a quesadilla without chicken because everything was premade. Despite that, the kitchen served their namesake amso cuban very late (was comped, mostly a strange thing). The food itself had very odd portions and ratios. Normally, I would blame myself but other people were unhappy.

The fries came lukewarm on some plates. They were also a landmine of salt. Some fries were more salt than potato, some had none. There were other uneven seasonings.

The goat cheese burger didn't have a lot of goat cheese to the point that someone who hates goat cheese tried it and didn't really taste much. The people who got the mozzarella flatbread weren't impressed. Mixed reviews on the pretzel bites. Tacos faired well. Overall though, for the price, this is probably one of the worse places. That was sad after all the buzz.

A neutral thing: for the Miami vibe, they try to make it lively with loud music. That's some people's thing and not others. Just a heads up.",2
"Goooooood food,  impeccable service.",5
Friendly staff. Good food and drinks.,5
"I went here for a company holiday party and was unable to order any alcoholic beverages because I didn’t have my ID. I understand that it is mandatory for bartenders to ID and it was a misunderstanding on my part as well, but I had already been served one drink already before they even decided to ask for my ID. On top of that they never asked anyone else who appeared under 27 for their ID. I felt singled out and they continued to serve drinks to others without ever asking for ID. They even hassled my date and other people sitting at our table just because I didn’t have my ID. On top of that their bouncers did a sub par job keeping uninvited guests out of the area and it was up to other guests to facilitate and ask the people to leave. On the bright side the food was great. The one drink I was served was good as well. Overall unknowledgeable staff but good food and atmosphere.",1
Great atmosphere and food.,5
Relaxing environment and decent spot for brunch,5
Great service from Jarvis,5
"Tony and Blair were two of the most hospitable and entertaining bartenders I have ever had the pleasure of sitting with, the place was packed all night and we never went without service, the food was Americanish with a twist, really great quality, something different, still has the typical South Tampa pricing, if tour looking to try it cheap, catch happy hour, well worth the visit, we will be back.",5
"So we were there after Gasparilla 5k, admittedly they were busy but kitchen was off and service was pretty lack luster. Chicken BLT was tasty and oysters were excellent.",3
"The atmosphere was great on the outside deck, but service was terrible. We only had drinks and appetizers but it took forever.",4
Nice. Decent food. Can be quite busy,4
"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, awesome happy hour, walking distance to convention center and amelie arena.",5
Horrible service we asked for a specific table by the water after waiting 45 min they sat another party at table when we told them that we were waiting for that table they told us that the other party had reserved that table in week advance. I immediately went to people and asked them if they had a reservation and they said NO bad management,1
Great spot. Greater food. Greaterer Bartenders!,5

Young people and beautiful view. And perfect for drinking but food isn't best.,4

"Great oysters, friendly staff, outside bar with fantastic view",5
"pay for new year from 9pm-3am! thay kick peope at 1:20am.. and regular ticket was 170$, avoid this place.",1

A higher level of service is expected when frequenting this establishment.",5
It was lit. Drinks were good.,4
It's a great place to eat the atmosphere is great customer service is wonderful but the best part about it is that night // when it's time to go to the club and dance and made a lot of hot sexy seductive women looking beautiful and sexy //,5

"This is our 1st time in Tennessee and at Local Goat. We came in on a Monday (12/27/21) evening for dinner and waited about 45min. We were attended to fairly quickly and ordered the Jack Daniel's wings as an appetizer (came cold).
We communicated it to the server (Janice) and she addressed it right away...for this reason I gave them 4 stars.
When our entres arrived...they were HOT!!!!
We had the Fettuccine Rocco, BBQ Chicken Sandwich and the Original Bacon Burger with fries and onion rings. Everything was delicious!!!!!",4
"Excellent food and service. Definitely make a reservation or plan to wait a while. It was about an hour for 5. Definitely worth the wait. Justin was our server. We got burgers, wings, lava cake and cheese cake. All delicious. Best dinner we've had this trip.",5
"The best restaurant in town! Probably top 5 I’ve ever eaten at. Wait time wasn’t bad we waited less than 20 minutes on a Sunday at 2pm. Our server was excellent. The whole experience was great. Very knowledgeable on the drink menu and helped us select what fit. We got sold on the fried deviled eggs, they are different but good. For our entrees we ordered the pimento cheese burger- out of this world!!! Would eat a hundred times over. Then, the Fettuccini Rocco super delicious and one of the best pasta dishes we’ve had. Their hand lotion is great too. Dang this place is fire!",5
Went here after it being recommended to me. WOW SO GOOD! Wish we had one back home! Service was great and food was FANTASTIC! Try the house made jalapeño/ranch dressing! It’s out of this world! They usually stay crowded BUT so worth the wait. Do yourself a favor and go!,5
"This place is always packed and had great reviews so we made plans to visit on our family Christmas trip. They did not disappoint. Our server, Alana, was great handling multiple tickets and some picky eaters with ease. Drinks were great and the food outstanding. My brother raved about the steak, my fiance's ribs were great, I would have added more sauce but he insisted they didn't need it. My burger gave me life! If I had to critique anything it would be my shoe string fries,  they were over done for my taste. We would definitely recommend this as a must visit spot for yummy food.",4
"We had a good experience today. Service was excellent. Our waitress was polite and attentive. Make a reservation. LG was very busy and people were definitely waiting for seating. We arrived early and only had a few minutes to wait until our table was ready. The food was good. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food. I got the smokehouse burger. Maybe a touch pricey for a burger. To be fair the burger was quite good though. I was not a fan of the fries however. They were small and spindly. I would recommend getting a different side. Overall, it was a good experience. I would go back.",4
"First time here. The food, The Restaurant and the service were all 5 stars. The server Jeff was awesome. Restaurant was packed and the food was delivered promptly. This is definitely a well run place. We started with the Fondue and 1/2 pound of BBQ  Shrimp. Seasonings and flavors were spot on perfect. We then split a Billy burger and Shrimp and Crab Bisque. Needless to say both excellent and very filling. We then had to try the peanut butter and chocolate pie. It was amazing. We had to take 90 percent of it home as we were stuffed from the meal. This is a very busy Restaurant and it was well worth the 28 minute wait.",5
"We loved the food! I had a salad and my son had a steak meal. If you get shrimp, make sure you ask for them to be cooked well done. We had to send ours back because they were under cooked. The waiter was not very knowledgeable of what was available. For example,  he told me somethings weren't available like the onion rings, crab cake etc...Well, the waitress that was waiting on the tables beside us served the other table onion rings. I was disappointed about that as a traveler who really wanted to try them. Overall, the food we had was ok. It was a bit pricey for what the restaurant serve though.
Just make sure you get a server that's knowledgeable of the menu! For that reason, I gave this restaurant 4 stars 🌟",4
"The place was packed at 7pm but it was great food. Our waiter was so nice and also really calm with the amount of people in there. They said we would have a 20-30 minute wait time but got in around 2 minutes. The Billy Goat sandwich was enormous! I could only eat half but super tasty! The only problem I had was the fries were heavily salted. I only ate two fries lol. Other than that, fabulous! Kid friendly is a bonus!! The food was delivered to the table quite fast (10 minutes I'd say)",5
"Always thought this place looked a little strange but finally gave it a try. AWESOME! Food, service, quality was amazing. Very fresh and high quality. Best burger I've ever had even with the gluten free bun. Great fries!",5
"Visited during lunch this past Friday. Our service was wonderful. She was friendly, attentive, and gave suggestions when asked. Our food was so yummy!! We tried the fried deviled eggs (why not?!) So good!!  I had the shrimp and grits (minus the mushrooms). They are SO GOOD! SO good. My hubby had the ribs...super tender and flavorful. he appreciated the warm, moist cloth that came too.  Go check out this spot!!  (Just FYI- Parking lot is steep and a bit tight for big trucks.)",5
"This place is well worth the wait. By far the best food in pigeon forge! If your in the area definitely stop. The staff are very welcoming, knowledgeable about the items on the menu and friendly. The food is fresh and delicious.  I eat alot of chicken, and I got a BBQ chicken sandwich from here and it was the best I've eaten anywhere!!! Stop looking for a place to eat and just go the the Local Goat 🐐",5
This is amazing! Burger was awesome. Fried deviled eggs were unique and great! Chicken Alfredo was the best my wife ever had. Definitely will come back again. Check out the photos.,5
"If you don't like this place, you are the problem! Great food, service atmosphere and lower than expected prices! Farm to table on most dishes. Knowledgeable staff. Bit of a wait time but we were told upfront that it would be worth it and it definitely was!",5
"TL;DR Good place for brunch if you are in town for vacation. They have a good selection of alcohol. Check out the menu I have attached.

We had a party of four. I was able to book our reservation at 11:15 the day before. You can do that on Google. They open at 11:00. We got to the restaurant five minutes after 11:00, and there was already a couple of parties waiting in line. I checked in with the host and got a message saying our table was ready about 3 minutes later. The entire process, from booking a reservation to sitting down, was smooth like butter.

I got a full rack of ribs with mashed sweet potatoes and coleslaw on the side. When I first saw ribs, I was a bit worried. The ribs look a bit dry. However, I was able to get the meat off the bone effortlessly. And the meat was very well flavored and tender. I gave the dish a rating of 4 out of 5. I didn't order any drinks, but people from my party did. They all enjoy their drinks.

Our server was very friendly and attentive. I think 🤔 everybody left a 20% tip for her. Overall, it has been a pleasant experience. You should definitely give it a try if you in town.",4
"The Local Goat is fabulous!  So far one of my favorite meals this trip. We ordered the onion ring appetizer and it was served with fire roasted jalapeño ranch and IT WAS AMAZING. What a delicious flavor combination.

As much as possible, everything at the Local Goat is locally sourced and everything is made in house. The sauces, salad dressings, the bread, burger buns, all of it is made fresh every day.

Three of us ordered the chicken tenders and fries and they were perfect!!!  Hand battered tenders and hand cut fries. So delicious and perfectly seasoned. My Dad ordered the house salad and said it was the best salad he’s had. My husband had the hot wings and said they were excellent.

I ordered the white chocolate bread pudding and we should have taken a video of us attacking it. We ate it so fast!  It was light and flavorful, it was so good!

Definitely plan on making a reservation and eat at The Local Goat!",5
"First of all....the food was WONDERFUL!  I ordered the shrimp and Grits and the touch of sriracha was the secret to an amazing dish!

And the deep fried deviled eggs...OMG!  These were the bomb and first I've heard or tried these.  A little crunch topping with a creamy filling....these are by far my favorite!

Customer service was excellent as we were greeted when we entered and as we left.  Out waiter was extremely helpful and nice and we did not have to wait long at all for out food.

Will definitely be back again!",5
"The service was amazing! Great atmosphere and wonderful staff. I had a billy burger that was very yummy.  I love that the beef is sourced locally. French fries were yummy.  The onion ring starter was great with it's dip. It had jalapeno in it I believe and that was good but be aware of that if you don't like spice

Had a 30 minute wait time but was well worth it.",5
"We had a party of 7, including kids and we all ordered different things. By a landslide the best entree was the lamb burgers. These lamb burgers are soooooo good, words cannot explain the goodness. Next up, the onion rings were very tasty. The fried deviled eggs were okay. We also ordered a round of steak nachos and they were decent, but not as good as we were expecting. Our least favorite menu option was the jumbo wings which is why the 4 stars. I do not believe the wings are seasoned before cooking and they are not cooked crispy. So essentially you’re eating unseasoned, soft chicken wings in a sauce. The blue cheese dressing was outstanding and I’m a ranch dressing lover. For dessert, the molten chocolate cake was also not good - it too was lacking something in the flavor department. Outside of those bland wings & chocolate cake, everything else was great including the customer service. We went on a Wednesday night so the wait time was nonexistent. Highly recommend this restaurant, everything is great except the wings & cake! Try the lamb burger.",4
"Love everything about this restaurant except the wait. But the food was so good. I had the ribs and they literally fell off the bone. The fries are crunchy but yet soft, the perfect combo. Our waitress was very professional and friendly. She even sent out our toddler's food before ours so he wouldn't be fussy. Great restaurant! I will be back!",5
"Service was excellent and food was phenomenal!! Well worth the wait. There was a bit of a funky odor right when you walk in but I'm sure that's from the bar area that is right next to the entrance. They were super busy but the service didn't suffer for it. If you don't want to wait forever, make a reservation a couple days in advance.",5
"Great Restaurant, definitely make a reservation. They make all the sauces in house, local source a lot of the food and had a great cocktail menu. We had the deep fried deviled eggs and they were amazing never had seen that before. Burgers were top notch cooked right, side of fries is enormous if dining with two get one side and sub the other. Would absolutely go back!!! Rusty killed it as our server.",5
Amazing food and a great atmosphere! I will definitely tell more people about this place and hope to return soon! Highly recommend the Shrimp and Grits and Fried Green Tomatoes! Maria was a joy and took the time to explain the menu items.,5
"Everything was so amazing. We had the best dinner. Best ribs, best steak and the old fashion was great. We had the bread pudding for dessert and all I could say was o my god.",5
Went there for lunch. The lamb burger was very nice. Tennessee bourbon Burger was very moist and flavorful. Every Burger comes with about a half pound of very good french fries. Very extensive beer and liquor selection,4
"We stayed in Pigeon Forge/Gatlinburg area for a week. We ate some high-dollar meals. Had two meals over $130 each for just two of us. This was our best food experience all week, and it wasn’t even close! And it was under $50! Incredible food and great service! I’d give them 10 stars if I could!",5
"The food was delicious!

The steak nachos appetizer was amazing! I had the lamb burger with a gluten free bun, which was great!

The Local Goat is worth the hype!",5
"Best eats in town hands down. I had the chicken tenders and fries, both made to perfection. The homemade ketchup, ranch and honey mustard were excellent. My wife and son both had burgers that they loved will return here next time in town. If you want the best, find your was m way to the local goat!",5
"Best meal I’ve had in a while! Such a great experience. Food was amazing and service was excellent! Kenzie was a great waitress, friendly and really attentive. Great variety in the main menu and a HUGE drink menu. Will definitely be coming back during our next trip.",5
"Worth the wait, get there early on the weekend. The pasta was a surprise! Best pasta at this price point/bar-restaurant place I’ve had, served with focaccia. Server was nice and you could tell that the owners and chefs really care about the place by the way everything was prepared. Creme brûlée was fluffy and satisfying. Onion rings and burgers looked like the most ordered items.",5
Absolutely love this place. The pimento cheese burger is awesome!!!,5
"Made reservations a day ahead. Waited about ten minutes to be seated. Our waitress, Alexis, was super nice, knowledgeable and patient. We tried to fried deviled eggs which were okay, just kind of weird, not what you're used to. The N'awlins BBQ shrimp was DELICIOUS!!!! Hubby got the Farmhouse Burger (Big and messy but really good) and fries (skinny fries). I got the steak and shrimp with salad. Salad was super fresh and theie ranch was delicious. The steak was unfortunately way overcooked but Alexis got me a replacement quickly and it was grilled to perfection. The grilled shrimp was good  (but not as good as the appetizer shrimp). We also got ribs to go but tasted before we left. Full rack is plenty for two and good without the sauce, but comes with a tangy, not sweet, BBQ sauce. So glad We finally got to try this restaurant. It is MUCH tastier, and cheaper for more food, then where we ate yesterday!",5
"We visit Pigeon Forge/Gatlinburg on a yearly basis. We just love everything there is to do here and see.

A few weeks before we came down I was in getting my gold star on my ID and was visiting with the drivers license attendant who was helping me. She said that her family has a time share down here and that they come alot.  She told me about the Local Goat and could not give them enough praise.

My husband and I decided to skip out on the pirate show and go have a date night at the Local Goat.

We got there and the parking lot was super busy, but we went in and we were seated immediately. In less than a minute we had a server at our table asking us about drinks. He returned with our drinks and asked if we had any questions with the menu.

We ordered our appetizer at that time and our appetizer came out with the dinner salad in 5 minutes.  Shortly thereafter before we were even able to finish those, our meal showed up.

It was delivered to the table by someone else and the sever was close behind them. We had ordered a loaded potato and as soon as he looked at our food he noticed we did not have sour cream. He made a quick trip back to the kitchen and got us some sour cream. He checked on us just enough and was very, very polite.

I wish I would have remembered his name. We will absolutely return to your restaurant when we come back in the future.

And bonus, I decided to purchase the drivers license attendant a souvenir from your restaurant to take to her as a thank you for suggesting such an awesome eating establishment.",5
Food was excellent. Drinks were devine. Reasonable prices. All good products from local vendors. Awesome idea!! A new favorite ❤️,5
"We stopped here on our way to our hotel, the food was amazing and the staff were very friendly. Everytime we drove by this restaurant during our stay the parking lot was busy,  once you eat here you'll see why it's amazing food!!!",5
"Delicious food, great drink and beer menu. You can definitely tell everything is homemade. Make a reservation they get VERY busy or at least put your name on the list and go do something in the area while you wait. WELL WORTH ANY WAIT!!! We ate here two nights in a row it was so good.",5
"Great restaurant! Very cool atmosphere! The staff is extremely friendly. The restaurant (including restrooms) is super clean. We had onions and they were HUGE and delicious! My wife had chicken nachos and I had the Elvis Burger. Elvis Burger is a burger with peanut butter, bacon, and fried bananas. All the food was fresh and tasty! Highly recommended if you are in the area!",5
This place is awesome. We did have to wait over an hour but it was worth it. The food was great. The service was great as well. It’s always very crowded. I will definitely go back. I highly recommend this place.,4
Great food! Great service! Make a reservation or be prepared for a long wait. You won’t be disappointed.,5
"AMAZING!  I had the autumn harvest salad and honestly it was one of the best salads I have ever had in my LIFE. And I eat a lot of salads!

The bread pudding was amazing and even though I ate way too much of it, I can’t say I regret it because it was a little bit of heaven.

Wonderful place, great staff, and totally worth the wait to eat there. Can’t wait to go back!",5
"We had an excellent experience here. They told us it would be about 15-20 mins and we were seated within 10. We tried a few beers and a caramel apple cocktail. All of our meals were great. The ribs fell off the bone, the teriyaki tenderloins (with rice) were so flavorful and tender. The shrimp and grits were lovely as well. The burger was excellent. We tried the Black and Blue and the bacon on it was fantastic. Our server was kind and informative.",5
Lordy this restaurant is so good! I got the pimento cheese burger and my hubby got the shrimp and grits. Everything is locally made- right down to the ketchup (which is the best I’ve ever tasted). The service is always good. We come every time we are in Pigeon Forge.,5
"Great food, but was told that they couldn’t seat a party with more than 6 people. We had 8 with 2 children 2 and under, so we split up with 5 and 3. Was seated and noticed a table with 7 people and then they set a table for 10 next to us. Why? Don’t know. Service was great, but live by the rules you set. By the way, we weren’t the only guests that were told this. Heard them tell several groups this also. Getting 3 stars from e because of the food and service. I’d I were rating the management, I would give a zero.",3
"The food was amazing! Onion rings were delicious. Fried green tomatoes were delicious. The servers/bartenders were quick and efficient. Definitely recommend. They were super busy, so I recommend making a reservation if possible. There was an hour long wait.",5
"Good pub with a variety of dishes. It's nice to find a restaurant with more than a red meat dominated menu in PF. However, the house specialty is burgers and there are plenty of variations to try. You can sub a plant based patty for non meat eaters out there. Service is friendly and efficient.

4 stars because food came out lukewarm. Another customer had the same issue. Meal was replaced with hot food.",4
"The people were very kind & welcoming. The place was packed! The wait was about 35 minutes, not back at all. The food was good- we had two of the burgers & a salad- plenty of food; enough to share meals. Our food came out fast!! Would highly recommend trying it out!",4
"My experience at Local Goat was amazing. The food is excellent. The first items we tried were the fried green tomatoes and the deep fried deviled eggs.  The fried green tomatoes are a go out and get it now! They are fantastic. The deep fried deviled eggs are very good and very unique flavor.
I had the ribs which were good along with cheesy grits and the mashed potatoes with caramelized onions. The cheesy grits are the best cheesy grits I've ever had. They already go out and get it now! The mashed potatoes with caramelized onions were good. The ribs were good and the meat just fell right off the bone. The coleslaw that came with the ribs was okay.
When dessert came I tried the chocolate peanut butter pie and the white chocolate bread pudding with seasonal ice cream. Both of these are definitely go out and get it now items!
I highly recommend eating here while you are in town.",5
"I read all the recent reviews and decided to try Local Goat. Great reviews and totally earned 5 stars! Our waitress Ariel, was attentive and super friendly. The house salad was yummy but not in the pic. Our family really enjoyed all the food!!",5
"Well it's a local favorite and a tourist destination for a reason. Call ahead and make your reservations cause you are gonna want to not spend an hour waiting for a table. The staff is super great, very helpful with telling you about the menu items and giving honest recommendations about their favorites. The food is delicious and the portions will leave you with little to no room for dessert. So plan accordingly as we didn't have room. (For which I am extremely regretful) Try the local and regional brews, pick a favorite and be sad that you can't find it back ""home"". But don't miss an opportunity to try this place out. I hope we have a chance to come back!",5
Great food. Recommend making a reservation by phone because they are very busy. Our server Chris was great also.,5
Would recommend this place has good food and has gluten-free menu to. Deep fried devil eggs pretty good also,5
"What a gift this was. Food and service were phenomenal - everything just right and the FLAVORS. Tons of people dining, but seated so promptly you wouldn't even know there were 200 cars in the parking lot. Steak perfectly cooked, the Nawlin's shrimp and cheese fondue were delicious.",5
Fried deviled eggs were ok. Maui chicken with cheese grits and fresh cut fries were delicious. Fish and chips were awesome with amazing tartar sauce. Best to make reservations. Yumyumyum.,5
"Every time my family goes to Pigeon Forge, we have to stop at The Local Goat! This was our 3rd trip in 5 years, and it never disappoints! The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable, the steaks are perfect, the menu has something for everyone, and the drinks are smoking!!
For a group (10 or less), for a family with small children, or even just a night out with a loved one, 10/10 to The Local Goat.
I hope to go back many more times!",5
I had the TN Whiskey Glazed Burger with fries. It was fantastic. The glaze sauce with the bacon really set the burger off! This is a farm to table establishment and you can tell the difference in quality. I also had the TN Whiskey chicken wings for an appetizer and they were jumbo size wings! They were really good (not pictured).,5
The food was good. Nice restaurant and price wasn't bad. Food is fresh and made there. I would suggest making a reservation because they stay packed.,5
"The food was really good. This was only of the only places open past 10:00 pm in Pigeon Forge. The service and server was good. I don't eat sauces so I ordered the wings plain and they were hot and fresh. My husband ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and he enjoyed it. The French fries are so good and the Joe vs the volcano drink was the best, if you are into fruity drinks!",5
"Well worth the wait! Robert was our server, and he was perfect; attentive and knowledgeable without hovering over you. I had the autumn salad, which was fresh and delicious, along with a local milk stout. My husband had the wings with honey sriracha, and he said Sriracha, flavor was great. I highly recommend this restaurant for dinner!",5
"We had reservations, arrived early and were seated right away. Fantastic service, large portions, and delicious food! I had the lamb burger, and I’d definitely get that again. Get the onion rings!",5
The food was great and so was the service.  They make their own ketchup that has such a great flavor. 😋 I ordered the farmhouse burger 🍔 it was gone before I knew it.,5
Great food. Spinach and artichoke dip was just okay. Bread pudding was good.,5
Amazing food and prompt service. We made reservations and would recommend.  They are busy all the time.,5
"Food is average and our service wasn’t that great. We ordered hamburgers, cheese fondue and chicken wings. Food came out pretty fast, but it’s average to me in terms of the taste. I thought it was gonna be very extravagant and all, but it wasn’t. I was also super hungry, so you know when you’re hungry, things taste better. I’d prob get better food elsewhere for what it’s worth and they’re hella booked usuallt! You do gotta wait for an extended period of time.",3
Place was very busy. We ended up sitting in the bar area. Our server was great and gave good insights on what to drink and eat. Food was good and well made. Would def eat here next time we are in the area.,5
Was very disappointed after waiting 1 hour and seeing good reviews prior to our visit. We ordered an appetizer which never came. When our food finally did come we asked the server who brought our food out about take the appetizer off our bill and was told he could not help us and to find our actual waiter that was no where to be found as it was busy. We tried the patriot burger and it only had pickles on it and was cold. Wish we could have enjoyed what others had experienced,1
Great food and nice atmosphere the fried deviled eggs were pretty good.,5
Excellent service. The food was fantastic and so were the drinks. We will definitely be back before our vacation is over.,5
"Got the best bbq half rack of ribs of our life here! We had the half rack and sirloin special for our anniversary dinner. The sirloin wasn't as impressive as the ribs, but the coconut shrimp and loaded potato that came with it were superb. I will definitely try to eat here again next time we're visiting.",5
Bella our server was awesome! The food is all locally sourced and the fish is only wild caught  The restaurant is large and can hold large parties. They also offer unique menu items.,5
"We were told a 30-45 minute wait, but we only waited 15 minutes. That was a plus. The waiter was extremely nice and competent. The down side was they did not allow substitutions. That is a deal breaker for me. I ordered kabobs. For the price I paid; I would have expected a tender cut of beef. I am guessing it was sirloin or a tougher cut. This will be a one time experience for me and my family.",4
The food and staff are amazing! We ate here 3 times  during our stay! We highly recommend this place.,5
"This place was highly recommended by several people for the variety of tasty items on the menu, generous portions and reasonable prices. The service was great, too!  The Fettuccine Rocco was full of succulent grilled chicken, veggies and a creamy sauce that was ""out of this world"" delicious!!",5
Amazing food. Great service. Not very long wait time for how busy it was. The deep fried deviled egg was great 👍.,5
Fried deviled eggs! Bloody Mary and mimosas. Only negatvie is its so busy there's no where to park at all. That also leads to slightly slow service. Everything else is great! Food is amazing.,4
The service was good and the food was amazing! Definitely our new go to when we come into town.,5
"'The Local Goat' is a gem sitting right along the main drag in Pigeon Forge!

We received a recommendation to try out 'The Local Goat' from the concierge where we were staying, and I am definitely glad we did. We arrived mid-afternoon and they were hopping. We did have to wait about 10 min for a table to open up, so you may want to consider calling ahead for a reservation during peak hours. It was suggested that we call ahead, but we didn't exactly heed their advise.

The Fried Green Tomatoes are only 2nd to my Mother's. If you like them, then you must try them here ... trust me when I say you won't be disappointed. The Deep Fried Deviled Eggs were another tasty find on the appetizer menu. Also recommended. I ordered the Smokehouse Burger with fries as the side. While I normally don't prefer thin ""stick"" cut fries, these were actually very tasty & well seasoned. The house made ketchup was excellent and paired perfectly with the fries. Now onto the Smokehouse Burger, it arrived cooked as ordered (medium) and as you can see in the photos, I just about had to unhinge my jaw in order to take a bite of this masterpiece. It was hearty, tasty, and everything else you want in a burger.

While I ordered the Peanut Butter Pie for desert, I also included a pic of the White Chocolate Bread Pudding in this review because it was simply awesome! Now I enjoyed the Peanut Butter Pie and did everything but lick the plate, but I also have to admit that I had a bit of ""buyer's remorse"" after seeing/sampling that White Chocolate Bread Pudding. It's a 'go out & get it now' item ... do not pass go, do not collect $200!

I'll definitely be returning to 'The Local Goat' and have it saved as a favorite in Google Maps ... you should as well.",5
Sat at the bar with James and Rusty tending and had an amazing time! Drinks were great - we got the rum punch and a margarita which were both divine. We started with goat cheese stuffed peppers which were delicious. I had the BGT burger with fries. The fries were not as hot as I prefer but they did provide a mountain of them. My partner got the sirloin and gave it his seal of approval. The sides were awesome - creamy mashed potatoes and decadent sweet potatoes. Wish we had room for dessert as they sound amazing as well.,5
"This is absolutely the best restaurant in the area!  We came here twice and could have come more.  We had a group of 7, so we tried many things on the menu.  Appetizers were fabulous!  We had steak nachos, fried deviled eggs, stuffed peppers, fried green tomatoes and the fabulous onion rings!!!  (Remember we ate here more than once.). For entrees, the faves were the baby back ribs, shrimp and grits steak kabobs and fettuccine rocco.  Hope you come, enjoy and tip well.  The staff are amazing!",5
Awesome Food!! Definitely a must eat at when you come to Pigeon Forge.,5
"Very friendly staff. Quickly greeted & taken care of. Drink I ordered, I would not recommend- it was a rum punch 😌 however the cheese fondue ((MUST HAVE)) was our favorite, steaks we ordered were so good, fries were not to our liking but the caramelized onion mashed potatoes & Mac n cheese very good!!! Will definitely eat here again when we visit!",4
"This place was recommended by our Airbnb host and he wasn’t wrong - it is PHENOMENAL! Seriously. You could be charging way more for everything on this menu. Everything we had was delicious. Pimento burger, the 7oz steak special with coconut shrimp. Start with the fried green tomatoes and deep fried deviled eggs (TRUST!). Save room for this bread pudding! Mellonie was our waitress and she was great! Overall a 10/10 experience and we would be here regularly if we were locals!",5
Great food. I highly recommend making a reservation and they definitely need a LOT more parking!,5
"TL;DR: Delicious food and prompt service!

Deets: We put our name in on a Wed evening and waited in our car for about 40 min. The menu has tons of options but we went for burgers. The Elvis was phenomenal and the Tennessee Whisky Glazed was good (though I’m not sure why it’s the most popular). The buns were outstanding! (Not something that’s usually noteworthy on a burger lol.) Skinny fries, which are my favorite. Homemade ketchup—wow! Sorry no pix of these—we were starved! Great drink menu too, and we didn’t have to wait long for them to be brought over. Pictured is the fondue appetizer. Super yummy. Onion rings are enormous and good but I wouldn’t order again. Too full for dessert but wish we’d saved room! We would definitely go back.",5
Best French fries I've ever had!  Enough said on that. The steak nachos were really good too. The steak was tender. We had the fried eggs also good. My husband got the hamburger. It was very large and you definitely had to use two hands to eat It not a wimpy skimpy thing. He said it was good. Portions were good prices were good. Waitress told us they try to get 90% of all their food locally and it is made fresh daily(they make their own ketchup and fries)and you could tell in the food. We will be back!,5
"We have an amazing experience at Local Goat. Misty was an excellent server! We decided to try the deep fried deviled eggs after reading about them in several other reviews. Two words: DO IT. They are outstanding, so delicious, so different. The burgers were very good as well but we heard the ribs are amazing. Didn't try them though. Highly recommend this restaurant. Make a reservation. We have been here for 3 days and the parking lot has had every spot full from opening to closing each day!",5
"Wow, wow, wow just wow.

This place is hometown easy going and amazing food. Don't forget to check in at the bar the bartenders were absolutely terrific super friendly welcoming.

Expect a wait because this place is that good it's well worth your time invested. If you're super smart you'll actually call ahead and reserve your table.

Also plan your day because parking is tight. There's more people parked in this restaurant parking lot then you'll see in four miniature golf places in this area.

If you have a choice to go miniature golfing kart racing or eat at the local goat, I would choose the local goat every single time in fact I did.",5
First time trying the Local Goat. Will definitely be back. Food was great as well as the service.,5
"Had the fried devil eggs, Hawaiian ribeye and cheese cake. All was fantastic! Great service as well.",5
"Great atmosphere, but kinda smelled like a goat barn. Then we got our sandwiches, WOW!!!. Excellent burger and she had the chicken sandwich. Great service also.",4
"We sat at the bar as it was quite busy, but the service was great. Started with fried green tomatoes and was not disappointed. The Lamb burger was exceptional, I like flavor and the sauce is good and strong. My wife had Maui chicken and she enjoyed it, nice place for dinner.",5
"Top Notch.  Great service, great food, great atmosphere. Chicken tenders and hamburger were good but the fondue with apples, pretzels, and bread and the teriyaki kebab with fried rice were excellent, definitely a must try. The only improvement I could suggest, maybe you should ask when you order your fondue, is that the bread would probably be even better toasted a little, a bit of crunch in the fondue would put it over the top.",5
Wonderful service and food. Definitely go online and make a reservation where this place has a very high demand right now. But they got us in at the exact time our reservation was for and the food was super fast as well.  Definitely go here if you can!!,5
It was okay. Not worth the 2 hour wait and fight for parking. Still a good restaurant. Just over hyped a lot. Pork chop was good. Steak was good. Mashed potatoes hit and miss.,3
"Great food and reasonable prices. It's a tourist town and tourist prices but it I'd go again. The parking lot is a complete nightmare. If you go, make reservations.",4
"Amazing Food and Service! Even during the busiest time of the year for Pigeon Forge this place did not disappoint. We had a party of 8 and knew it would be difficult to get in, so we decided to split our party into two groups. Not only did the host staff appreciate and understand this they made sure to note to seat us at the same time. We originally planned on an hour wait, but within 30 mins our table was ready AND they ended up placing us all at one table. Our server was phenomenal as well. She was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed, but on top of that, she spent time just chatting about the area and our visit and really just had the most friendly outlook and ease to serving us. The food was also soooo good, the devil egg and fondue appetizers were so delicious, and the steak nachos were HUGE! The burgers were so good, so good you want to stop eating when you’re full but just CAN’T! This will definitely be a place we visit on the regular when in town.",5
"With over 7,600 reviews, I’m not confident that mine will help anyone, but I must say that this was one of the best dining experiences I’ve had in Pigeon Forge, and at a price that wasn’t bad at all!!  The steak nachos starter was delicious!  The tequila was smooth!!!  The Ribeye was tender and juicy!!  Over all, this place gets two thumbs up +",5
"We had an overall great experience.   8 of us for Dinner can often be troublesome - bit not for this place.    Drinks came at a quick ace and everyone really enjoyed their means.   From a slab of ribs to a veggie burger - everyone was very happy with their food.    Service fora group of 8 was also very good.    Get there early, or bring be patient for a wait - - it is well worth it.",5
"We had hear great things about this restaurant.  Finally got there on Tuesday for lunch.  Not a bad wait about 20 minutes.  So far so good.  My wife and I ordered a glass of wine and Cajun shrimp.  Very good appetizer.  That's when things went downhill.  We both ordered steaks.  My wife medium and mine medium rare.  From here the service was very slow.  The server was preoccupied with his larger tables.  The steaks and salad came out at the same time.  So much for an enjoyable lunch.  The steaks were cooked wrong.  My wife's came out medium rare and my ribeye was medium.  Speaking of the ribeye, supposedly a 14 ounce.  It was less than 1/2 inch thick and looked like a strip steak.  Not impressed.  After we waited another 25 minutes for the check.  Not a great first impression.  Won't be back.",3
"The other reviews are accurate. This place is worth the visit. If you've drove by here and seen how busy it is, it's for good reason. Staff is super friendly, food was beyond my expectations, and the atmosphere was perfect. Be sure to join the wait list and have some time to kill.",5
Great food. Good drinks. Awesome service. But worse reservation process ever. Utterly useless to make a reservation. Just show up and wait for a table.,4
"Went for a late dinner. Very welcoming and great food. Sat at the bar for drinks and enjoyed the ambiance. For an appetizer got the beer cheese fondue with small bites of bread, pretzels and apples. Phenomenally good. Got the honey BBQ wings, best wings I’ve had in awhile. Drinks were awesome and the menu was extensive.",5
THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!! Good food good drinks excellent service,5
"Ask for Jeff!! Amazing server, great attention to our table, & knowledgeable of the food. The flavors were so good!! We got the TN Whiskey burger & Lamb burger. Highly recommend!",5
Parking was difficult but patience pays off. Food was delicious and service excellent. They had plenty workers serving the tables. Definitely would go back.,5
"Came here for our anniversary dinner, Food and service was great! Definitely make a reservation online in advance and prepare yourself for the chaos of their parking lot!!",5
"My kids, myself, and my mother took a short road trip for the weekend. We tried Local Goat and loved it. My oldest son had wings and absolutely loved them. He said the taste was unique. I had the fettuccine rocco with a side of sweet potatoes. The pasta wasn’t the best I’ve had but I loved the mashed sweet potatoes. They were very sweet. I also had the fried green tomatoes as a starter and they’re were amazing as well. The sauce that is on top went well with it. The waitress wasn’t the best either. She was very slow and not focused on customer service or our needs. My mother and I ordered the bread pudding for desert without seeing the menu. She didn’t tell us what came with or on the bread pudding. It came with caramel on it, which I don’t eat. So I was upset about that. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",4
"The food here is amazing. Every dish was a crowd pleaser and my family of eight was sharing the food together all evening. The burgers, wings, and fish and chips were some of the best we had ever had. Robert was a highly attentive and entertaining steward. I can easily see why the entire parking lot was filled and we had to wait 20 minutes during a weekday to enjoy this awesome experience. We will be back!",5
We had gotten reservations (highly recommended ) for 7:45 on a Saturday night. We got here at 7 to check in and was called in to be seated st 7:46 in my book that is pretty good considering how busy they were.  The appetizers and drinks came out super fast.  The main course thats another question.   We got the stake nachos and deviled eggs for appetizers. They were both good.  The eggs were some what odd (out of the box) but they were good and different.   I got a burger the wife got shrimp and grits. I thought the burger could have been a little bigger but it was still good.  My wife is use to Charleston shrimp and grits so these were not her favorite but still good. She thought they were to sweet and the grits weren't creamy enough for her.   I will say the shrimp they use are big.   My oldest got the stake with fried rice and he said the rice was like the frozen rice you would get in a frozen dinner.   My youngest had the stake and shrimp and he had no complaints.  All in all it was a good dinner and we would come again but we would not want to wait over 20 minutes to eat here considering all of the other restaurants around here.   Just my opinion it's not worth the wait,5
"This eating experience was amazing! We invited a group of our friends to Gatlinburg for the weekend. It was our 1 year anniversary and we thought it'd be fun. One of our friends recommended this spot and it did not disappoint! It was a great choice. We ordered the fried deviled eggs and the steak nachos for appetizers. The nachos were my pick and were perfect. It's topped with sour cream and guacamole. The cheese was really good as well. Our party of 7 ordered several different items and no one was disappointed. If you're looking for a great spot to grab a bite, consider this American restaurant with locally-sourced menu items. There are whiskey wings and shrimp, a drink menu that rivals any bar, and even a lamb burger on the menu! Enjoy the good eats. 👍🏾",5
"Delicious food!, Great friendly Service. The Manager took the time to check in on us during our meal ++ Worth the wait!",5
Nice casual restaurant with eclectic burgers and hand-cut fries.   Unfortunately the bun was a bit stale.  Nice selection of beers and the spiked Blackberry Iced Tea was spot on and the staff was very attentive and friendly.,4
"This is an excellent place to go for a date night or with family. Their food is very good, I have not been disappointed yet. I will give it to the chef they know how to cook very flavorful and cooked to your preference. They have excellent mixed drinks. The best way to experience the restaurant is to put in reservations, but you can walk in as well. If you go without a reservation, expect to wait. The employees are very polite and professional. You will not be disappointed in the food or service.",5
"we went is as a family of 6, we chose this restaurant because of the good reviews they had. HUGE MISTAKE.
My husband is highly allergic to shrimp & they acted like it was going to be impossible to cook his burger without it being around shrimp. I’m sorry but we are from Alabama & we have NEVER had a problem with any of our restaurants cooking his food separately.
Our waitress was extremely rude, she did not want to help us out at all.
The whole table ordered baked potatoes, she came back 10 mins later to tell us they were out.
My brother in law said he would get onion rings then & she said they would have to charge extra? But they were out of other sides.
My brother did not even get his meal, our waitress did not even put his order in.
My sister in laws whole meal was completely messed up, my nephew sat there the whole time & she never brought his chocolate milk out.
For a restaurant that has a 5 star review, you accept better service.
I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone, that has any allergies or if your expecting a good sit down dinner just do not do it.
Save your self some time & go somewhere else.",1
This place is a must stop in Pigeon Forge! Super popular though so get reservations immediately. They boast that everything is house made from their burger buns to their ketchup. It was our favorite stop and the kiddos said the Mac and cheese was their favorite meal of the entire trip!,5
"Nice place in Pigeon Forge, TN. Had a short wait, but it was the entire family (8). Staff was friendly, and personally I liked that they waited until we were almost finished with our appetizers until taking the entrée orders. They didn't rush us. Kid friendly, and high chairs were available, this was great 👍for our 21 month old granddaughter.
The food was excellent, and served in a timely manner!",5
"I wish I could give it 4.5 ⭐.  The burgers were great.  Mine came out wrong and they offered to fix it, but I just removed what I didn't want rather than eat after my husband or have him wait for his food to get cold.  I was totally unimpressed with the fries.  They were uncooked and wimpy.  If I ever went again I would substitute.  We did order the onion ring app.  Those were very good.  So outside of some wimpy fries, great experience.",4
"This is the best restaurant ever to exist! I had a burger along time ago that no restaurant has beaten, this burger did, the BACON BURGER. It 100,000% beat my favorite restaurant. 5 stars. I definitely recommend this place, even if it’s busy! If I could rate this place with one word, Spectacular!!!",5
This place is awesome! They have some of the best food around its all locally sourced and so fresh. me and my wife loved it so much we ate here two times the first weekend we discovered this place. we live about 2 1/2 hours away and we have even made day trips back to eat here and do other things around Pigeon Forge. keep up the good work and keep the great food coming!,5
"First time eating here, it won't be the last time. I got the 7 ounce steak with the crab cake along with two sides, it was so good. My daughter said it was the best steak she ever tried. My wife got the teriyaki kabobs and she liked it. The cheesecake was so freaking awesome. The bread pudding was really good also. The Joe vs The Volcano drink is really good also. Our waitress was very attentive. They do provide a military discount which is much appreciated. You can receive 10% off by checking in on Yelp. The deep fried deviled eggs are good also.",5
Like many people I’m sure we’ve driven by here at least 2 dozen times.  We were taking. Some family down to pigeon forge for the day and decided to stop for lunch.  The burger menu is pretty impressive for sure.  I had the St Kitts rum punch which was on point.   Tasted like I was on a cruise vacation. My wife had the portobello sandwich and said it was well prepared.  I opted for the 10oz pork chop for one reason.   I always want to see if it’s cooked right and for sure it was juicy and tender.  The whipped sweet potatoes were really good too.  Simple and tasty is how I like it!   Well done all around.  It is a tad but noisy but it’s a cool place and the bar looks well stocked with bourdon.,5
"We love eating at fun local places when we travel, so we knew the Local Goat was a must visit. When we arrived for our reservation we checked in at the hostess stand, the very frazzled hostess informed us that she did not have a reservation for us. They were really busy and the wait was long, so a reservation was very important. After a little back and forth the reservation was found. Our table was in a room that appeared to be a room that they could open up if the weather was nice. The room was not as full as the regular dining area. We started dinner off with the Spinach Artichoke Dip with homemade pita chips, they were average. For dinner I had the Fried Chicken salad. It had a lot of cut up fried chicken on it, which was really nice. Jenni got the teriyaki chicken with rice and broccoli. For dessert we had the cheesecake, it was not my favorite. It was an Italian style ricotta cheesecake, and we're much bigger fans of the smooth and creamy New York style.
My overall experience was that is was okay, maybe not up to all of the hype.",3
"Southern hospitality out the window!
I can’t tell you how the food is in this place because the three times I’ve  tried to eat there the hostesses and managers have been so rude and dismissive I’ve ended up dining elsewhere. Try Fort Worth Texas Kitchen instead.",1
Came here on recommendation from a friend to try the fried devil eggs which were yummy and definitely unique. All our meals were delicious.,4
Absolutely one of the best places to eat period.,5
"Food was good,  but it is really hard to find parking. And if your in a bigger vehicle like a truck it makes it even harder. Would be nice if they could add some extra parking places.
They also have a knife shortage, so you have to ask for a knife if you need one. We asked the person who delivered our food for a knife and she said there was a shortage and to ask for a knife from your server for one.",4
Delicious food. Best burger you will ever eat. Everyone in my group ordered something different and everyone was more than satisfied. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and everything is homemade down to the ketchup.,5
"Excellent service,  Excellent burger ( comes  with French fries super crispy) my wings was ok, good  prices, clean  restaurant  and restroom. Definitely is a yes I will recommend and next time  I'l try different things",4
"We got there just after 5, and the wait was about 50min, but it was worth it for the delicious meal! The smoked shrimp and crab chowder was excellent, as was the Mediterranean salad with ahi tuna. We were also happy that there was a gluten free bun option for hamburgers.",5
"This was a great spot. Jeffrey H was an awesome waiter with a great personality, humor, and spot on recommendations. All of our food was outstanding. Everything local and fresh! The ribs slide right off the bone.

We enjoyed it so much we went back again 2 days later. The deep fried deviled eggs were also tasty with great flavor. Even though there was a 30 minute wait to be seated our appetizers came before our drinks!",5
"Hands down, one of the top 5 restaurants I've ever been to. We were there as the line formed in front of the restaurant before it opened at 11am. The waitress informed us that over 90% of all of the ingredients are locally sourced and/or made in house, which I thought was absolutely amazing. She was right! Everything tasted like nothing you would get at your run of the mill restaurants out there. We had fried green tomatoes, deep fried deviled eggs and burgers. Everything down to ketchup was super fresh and delicious. The waitress was very attentive and the service overall was very quick. If you are in the area, it's an absolute MUST.",5
We go every time we visit Gatlinburg and always get the deep fried deviled eggs! The food is always amazing! We had a few drinks and Jell-O shots and enjoyed those too. We know now at this point to always make a reservations (and not same day) otherwise you’ll be waiting an easy hour before being seated.,5
"What an amazing place. No wonder there is a wait....and it's worth it. The burgers are awesome and the fondue is a must have. If you have a bigger group, or you just want some small dishes, add the fried deviled eggs to the meal. Now, deserts.....dang! The chocolate peanut butter pie just goes to your head. You leave satisfied and looking for the next time to go. If that wasn't enough, the service was impeccable. They are either fully staffed (which speaks to the ownership) or they have the right kind of people. Can't wait to return.",5
Really delicious foods. Good service.,5
Possibly the best meal I have ever had from a restaurant! Staff was excellent as well!,5
I definitely was blow away from the food!!! The atmosphere and service are great. This place will definitely go on our list of MUST visit before heading home.,5
Best burger ever! No exaggeration. Waitress was super sweet. Will definitely go back,5
This restaurant was top notch and handle a very large crowd on a wait very well and professional. Food and drinks were great. We sat at the bar and our server was very personal and pleasant. Definitely a must to do,5
"Delicious!!
The service and food is totally amazing.
There’s nothing better than The Local Goat!!",5
"Great take on a sports bar, family loves to come every time we come this way. Food is hearty portions, and service was great. Spacious venue, and you can book a table which is very helpful.",4
Wonderful food and pretty good service. Our appetizer was fried deviled eggs. Different but tasty!,5
Absolutely the best food in Pigeon Forge! I took the wife here for our anniversary and we both loved it! Highly recommend!,5
"I was absolutely shocked to find a restaurant like this in a vacation town. Farm to table. All fresh, never frozen. We had a large spectrum of food and it was all delicious. Drinks were all very good too. Service was fast and incredibly friendly.",5
Got the BGT. Great food. Sometimes difficult to park and expect a wait time unless you make reservations days in advance.,5
"Excellent dining experience and reasonably priced! HUGE drink menu (beer, wine, spirits & cocktails). Was especially impressed with the number of local craft brews.

Cheese fondue appetizer and the burgers are fantastic! Service from our server Vladimir was awesome. If you're visiting PF/Gatlinburg, you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't stop here.",5
Many people recommend this place and they weren't wrong. Had to circle the lot a few times but that's to be expected for such a popular place. Food was great! My ribeye was perfect! Service was quick compared to the crowd. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation a few days in advance. Will be back next time!,5
Delicious. Be sure to get the fried deviled eggs as an appetizer. We had the shrimp and grits and the Elvis burger. Pleased with both selections. Topped it all off with their delicious bread pudding. Would definitely come back.,5
Absolutely awesome experience! The deviled eggs are a must try appetizer! The steak was made just the way you ask and the ribs fall of the bone with no effort! The service was top of the line with all the recommendations you can ask for! If you’re in pigeon forge it’s a must try 👌🏽🔥,5
What can I say about this place? It was phenomenal. It was a bit loud but we were there in the middle of tourist season. Parking is rough when they are busy. They are very affordable for what you get. A burger and steak was under $45 bucks. They refilled our drinks pretty often. The waiter was very attentive but not overly annoying. Bathrooms were clean. The flavor of the burger was one of the best I have ever had. It was a great night here for dinner. I would recommend this place if you like good food. The atmosphere was lively and you can't go wrong with this place.,5
"The pimento cheese burger was excellent, and so were the fried deviled eggs!",5
First time here Burger was ok..dessert. was Delicious,4
"It doesn't get any fresher than this! It's worth the wait and everything is made fresh in house, down to the ketchup. I got Fried Green Tomatos and the Teriyaki Kabobs, served with fried rice and steamed broccoli, and topped it off with Creme Brulee - Bon Appétit!",5
Went late on Monday night around 9 pm got seated immediately. I had the steak nachos and the wife had the pasta dish. She said she enjoyed the pasta which we took half home. The nachos were very good and had a good amount of steak. The wait staff was excellent.,4
"The service was fast despite the packed parking lot. The food was unique & fabulous. And the value was great. Had fried green tomatoes-the bacon jam on top was incredible. Jack Daniels burger was worth every bite.
Staff was friendly and very polite.
5 stars all the way.",5
"This place is amazing..
I love anything that is 'farm to table'  locally sourced ingredients. The beer selection was great. Had a couple of Tennessee area brews that I've not seen available here in Kansas. Our server was super attentive and on top of our every need.  Was quick to make suggestions when asked as well.  The food.. why you're there.. top notch.  We started with deep fried deviled eggs.  Fried crisp was great over the egg.  The addition of Sriracha and candied bacon put these over the top.  I then gave The Elvis a shot.. Burger,  bacon,  peanut butter, and bananas. Holy. Amazing.  The flavor combo here was outstanding.",5
Okay so while in Pigeon Forge a lot of people talk very highly about this place. The food is really good but I have had better. But again the food is good and is definitely worth eating here if your in the area. Their deep fried deviled eggs are fantastic and I never knew this was a thing! The burger I got was really good but not perfect.,4
Great service and almost everything on the menu was locally sourced and made fresh daily! Highly recommend eating here.,5
"Absolutely one of the best restaurants I’ve been to while in Pigeon Forge. Deviled eggs were fabulous. Coconut Shrimp you could die for. Local IPAs are spot on. Our server Constantine, was knowledgeable, courteous, and diligent. We will return every time we are here. Period.",5
"Very popular spot for good food.
Only picture I took was of the fried deviled eggs.",5
"Nothing wrong with the place/food, but just didn't live up to the hype and constant waits for a seat. It's an ok place to go eat, but if it's too busy (anytime after 12:00) then you won't miss much. The wait staff was nice and attentive.",3
"Convenient to the main drag. We have stopped by there a couple of times. Each visit has found us a little less satisfied than the latter visit. Service is very good. A little upset about the quality of the food. With that being said, you may love the food it’s just now 💯 our place",3
Great food! These burgers are HUGE. They home make their buns and sauces so it's a unique experience. We loved it and would go again.,5
"Visiting from Florida. Great service from our waiter Jeff, the deep fried deviled eggs were amazing.  Came back a second time for a gourmet burger..amazing.  Everything was fresh, from scratch, came out quickly. 5 stars really isn't enough from the hostess on, it was a great experience.",5
"Visit started off strong only waiting until it reservation time to be seated. Staff was courteous and helpful. Drinks always stayed topped off and service was quick. The majority of the food came out well prepared but there was a few hiccups when the entree’s arrived. My Fire-grilled ribeye, ordered rare, showed up medium well with nearly more fat and gristle than steak. While my s/o same order came out 90/10 meat to fat and properly cooked. The steak still tasted great but was obviously an end cut and not worth the $29 for the entree. The coleslaw being blue cheese did not taste like blue cheese but rather sour and spoiled. Personally inedible. The remaining dishes served were quite great though. Leaving my star rating as such. Would return with the hope for a better outcome.",4
"Great atmosphere and not a long wait for a restaurant in Pigeon Forge. If you order the Milton or the Ahi tuna burger, get it rare to keep it from being dry but it'll come in out medium rare.",5
"We stopped by based on the numerous positive reviewsNd we were not disappointed.

Our server was very friendly. She recommended the fried green tomatoes and they were delicious. Crunchy and not too oily.

The burgers were very good too. Will definitely come back",4
"I ate here December 6, 2021. I’ve never been here but it will now be a stop I make every time I’m in town for vacation. Almost everything is made in house. Every single food item you eat is cooked perfectly and tastes excellent. I can’t believe I didn’t come sooner. I had the host names Georgii and he was the best server I’ve ever had at any restaurant I’ve been to. Please ask for him if you don’t believe me! Don’t miss this stop!!",5
"Nice selection of whiskey, although overpriced. Waitress was new and clueless, food menu was pretty basic. Can't really recommend.",4
The food is  great. The waitress and servers are great. The teenagers said the best burgers ever.,5
We come to local goat every time make reservations and get right in,5
"My family loves to visit Pigeon Forge and when we're here the Local Goat is a must on our restaurant list. This New American style restaurant is serving up a host of choices all made from scratch and locally sourced fresh ingredients. Their focus on fresh quality meats and produce is the foundation for their amazing food. Their burgers are thick, juicy, and well composed with a variety of toppings. The deep fried deviled eggs take this southern favorite to the next level, and the onion rings are delightfully crispy. During peak times expect a substantial wait if you don't have a reservation, but the food is worth the trip.",5
"Not sure what the HYPE is about... waited over an 1hr. was bumper to bumper of people, environment was nice & welcoming.... after I waited forever I don't know what I wanted... the waiter we had was handsome and very helpful..... but im not sure who was the GOAT.....food WASN'T it for me tonight..... the devil eggs was different I tried it due to their page(local goat). It was ok! But not for US!",3
"Not too bad of a wait, comparatively, for a Saturday night. Have heard it takes up to 4 hours to get a seat. The waitress was very nice. The deep fried deviled eggs were delicious.  My wife had broccoli with her meal and it was almost mushy. The waitress brought her another serving and it was the same.  My sirloin was very tasty but a tad tough for the price.
The manager came out apologized for my wife's food ( by the way the teriyaki chicken with rice was delicious she said).
He even knocked some off the bill.
All in all it was a decent experience but I'm not sure what all the hype is about.",4
"We are vacationing here in the area and wanted to try something new. My wife found this place online, so we decided to try it out. It was very interesting. You get your moneys worth with every dish by getting big portions. It is worth every penny. I saw deep fried deviled eggs on the starter menu and was doubting them. The waitress actually recommended them, so we gave them a try. OMG, they are surprisingly awesome. Gove this place a try. It is very good.",5
"This place is amazing!! Our waitress Madison was the most attentive, happy, just all around amazing waitress EVER!! The food and drinks were awesome. I was recommend by Madison to get the deep fried deviled eggs and they were amazing!!!",5
Ribs were fall off the bone tender! White chocolate bread pudding was beyond description wonderful,5
"Awesome place! We loved everything about it!! Made reservations so no wait, food and service were AMAZING!! The drinks were super yummy too!! Jenny T was our server and she gave us great info on what to do while we are here. Do yourself a favor and GO!!!!!",5
We just stopped in for a quick salad and were not disappointed. We had a garden salad & a Mediterranean salad. All their dressings are homemade. We had Ranch & Some kind of Tomato Vinaigrette. They were both amazing. The drinks were great too. Dirty Martini & Rum Punch. Very tasty. They have a huge selection of regional brews.,5
"OMG! Great place for non GMO, local sourced food and great tasting too!  Picture prefect, taste superb!",5
"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. From the overall atmosphere, to the service and to the AMAZING made-from-scratch food, The Local Goat will not disappoint. This restaurant came up as the top pick on three different searches that we made when we were visiting Gatlinburg this past week for vacation. The food is absolutely phenomenal, and the service is impeccable. I could repeat myself with stating how great this place is, but I would highly recommend anybody who is visiting the area should check it out for themselves!",5
"First visit to Local Goat.  I wanted to try the Crab Cake BLT, however our server advised that they were out of crab cakes.  I was very disppointed!  They did have my dessert selection, which is Creme Brulee (pictured below).  The Creme Brulee was dissapointing, as it was served cold from refrigerator.  I prefer it served very warm, right out of oven!  For my entree, I settled for a Bacon Cheddar Burger, which was just ok, not as tasty as Fuddrucker's.",2
All I can say is WOW!  The food here is amazing!  Everything is made in house and you can taste what great quality the food is. So happy we stopped in here for dinner. We will definitely be back before heading back home to NJ.,5
The food was ok. One burger was ordered medium it came out medium rare but more rare. The fish n chips were all right. The lamb burger was ok. The steak was probably the best thing on the table. Cheese fondue was good if you do like beer cheese. Fried green tomatoes were ok. The Fried deviled eggs stay away from. The chicken tenders were basic and regular.,3
The food was Awesome… If you ever want some BBQ Ribs… This is the place… Very nice atmosphere… Very clean… Waitress was superb… We place our reservations and when we got there we were seated immediately… I would highly recommend this restaurant… Do reserve your table at least a day or two in advance… Very busy!,5
"We received fantastic service from the start. Our waiter was truly exceptional, I wanted to like the food here with it being chef run and operated but there were some misses from me that really distracted from it. Our appetizer of fried green tomatoes came out and was extremely delicious. My salad was also great and the from scratch dressing are very tasty. The entries are where things start to turn for my experience. While my girlfriends Maui chicken was good, her broccoli was bland and sad. My steak was cooked perfectly but I couldn't get away from the pure amount of fat on the steak. I understand some people enjoy the fat and I like some but this 14 oz steak was almost 7 oz of fat. It wasn't that the steak wasn't delicious but I was disappointed. The dessert was a big flop for us. The cake wasn't molten and the cake tasted of uncooked flower and was dry. I can't recommend the desert at all. Good overall experience but not sure I would go back if visiting again.",3
"Good atmosphere, clean restaurant, & and great food. Fantastic crab cakes, tuna, & spinach artichoke dip!",5
"What can I say about The Local Goat that probably hasn't already been said, this place is awesome. Their wings are unbelievable I've had wings all over this country & The Local Goat is definitely top 3 all time favorites. The atmosphere is really cool & laid back & the bartenders are chill funny guys Definitely recommend The Local Goat",5
Absolutely fantastic. Would give 6 stars if possible. The Fettuccine Rocco is one of the best dishes I've EVER had.  The onion rings are also fantastic if you're looking for an appetizer.,5
"The food here is soooo good. Our server was great too! Fried deviled eggs, fried green tomatoes, the Elvis burger, TN glazed burger, caramelized onion mashed potatoes, fries, steak nachos, giant onion rings, mango jalapeño marg! All of it!",5
"My boyfriend and I had them for dinner last night. There was about a 15-20 min wait for a table. My boyfriend had the Tennessee whiskey burger and loved it. We tried the deep fried deviled eggs, the topping was soo good but the actual fried egg was questionable in my opinion, I would get them again though. I had the 10oz sirloin cooked med-rare but it was served well done. I mentioned it to my waiter and he made me a new one right away. I also had a salad with blue cheese which was house made, it was okay but not great. Overall we had a good visit.",5
Great food! I love to support local businesses anytime I can.,5
"This place is amazing! The service, the food and the beer selection all fantastic!",5
I'm glad we made the decision to stop while on our weekend trip to the area.  We had reservations 2 days in advance to get in this restaurant in a timely manner due to popularity and COVID restrictions.  It was well worth the wait!  We all ordered different type burgers that were delicious and perfectly cooked.  You could really taste the quality of local ingredients and everything made from scratch daily!. The staff was friendly and service was great.  Our cheerful waitress had great knowledge of the menu.  The Local Goat will definitely be on our list of places to stop in the future as I look forward to trying the different burgers!,5
"This is my go to place here in the Smokey's  Made a reservation for Dec 23 for 3:30 almost a week ago. At approximately noon they called and asked me to come between 3:00 and 3:15. We already had plans and I told them I couldn't be there any soon. Within an hour I received a text from them stated if I wasn't there by 3:00 I wouldn't be sitting. We rushed through our plans and arrived earlier. Food was so, so this time. They did away with the item I wanted that was still on the menu. A real disappointment. I'm sure to other people too, as we sit at the window watching them turn people away. They are closed Christmas Eve, so you would think the 23rd would be an important day for them.",3
"Honestly, this is probably one of the best restaurants we've ever eaten. The sauces and dressings were to die for and the entrees were just as delicious. So pleased that we picked this place as our last dinner before we head home. Top notch, we will UNDOUBTEDLY be back!!",5
Service was absolutely amazing and the food was delicious!  Best peanut butter pie I've ever had! We had to wait about 30 minutes but SO worth it!,5
"Server was nice and patiently explain the menu. The artichoke dips, barbecue chicken taco, and wings were good. Their mashed potatoes, and grit were really delicious. I don't really care for the fish and chips. The veggie burger was just okay.",4
"The food and service was absolutely wonderful. Can't believe we waited this long to eat there. We will definitely be back, even if its just for the fried deviled eggs.",5
We stopped here just to get a few drinks. Our bar tenders great and our drinks were great. If we lived in the area we would be going back. Great atmosphere and great service.,5
The food was outstanding 10/10,5
"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!! Great food Great service. Enough said.",5
"Busy night family came in late for a nice meal . From the moment we walked in the door there were issues . To many to go through but, the manger did give us most of the meal free of charge . Really disappointed in food and service but the manager did what he could .",1
"Awesome food and experience. Love the fried deviled eggs and honestly all the food is great. The staff is fantastic too.

Sometimes the wait is long but that's because it's a great place and a lot of folks eat there. It's worth it though.

We will definitely continue to eat there today and tomorrow.",5
"We saw a lot of good reviews about this place and it lived up to the hype. They have a pretty diverse menu including the fried Deviled Eggs which sound odd, but are very good. The service and food was all excellent.",5
"Had a reservation, so were seated quickly despite the 45-60 wait (at 4:15!). 10 oz. sirloin was amazing and perfectly medium rare. Tuna sandwich was good and fries were p e r f e c t! Perla's service was personable yet professional and extremely attentive! Plan ahead and make a reservation in advance and l o v e your experience!!!",5
Plenty of food and drink options. Everyone in our party received food as ordered and tasting delicious. Friendly staff!,5
"Amazing food, great atmosphere! We got into town after 9pm on a Friday, and wanted to eat somewhere local. We could not have picked a better place! The Black and Bleu burger, deep fried deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes put an exciting twist on the classic. The beer flight is a great way to experience 4 different varieties at a decent price. We are making this our 'must go' restaurant in Pigeon Forge!",5
"Nice place. From the staff to the food, it was all very good. We had the BGT burger and pimento cheese cheeseburger. Both were so yummy. I’d definitely reserve a table and get there early. They stay packed!",5
"Overall a great place to eat. Fresh homemade food and great service. I'd have given 5 stars, but unfortunately my wife's medium stake came out extra well done (leather) the first time and extra rare (cold and raw) the second.",4
"The only downside to this restaurant is the wait.  Obviously, the restrictions with COVID make it difficult to seat people quickly, but they handled it exceptionally.  The food was great.  They make so many things handmade there and you can taste the difference.  The ribs were perfectly cooked and fell right off the bone.  The fries were perfect.  They were an amazing combination of crispy and chewy.  Service was quick and the wait staff was very friendly.",4
"First trip, and the food was amazing as well as the service. Definitely will be going back",5
Amazing food amazing staff. Food had great portions and drinks were greatly mixed. Will visit again!,5
"Best burger, deviled eggs, and bread pudding we’ve ever had. Our waiter Zach was also top notch. We will definitely be coming back here next time we’re in Pigeon Forge!",5
"We had to wait a bit, but WELL WORTH IT!

Our server, Barbara, was great with making us feel like home and taking care of all of our family needs (wife, father in law, and a toddler) despite a packed house! The following things she helped us with:
- Turning on the NHL Stanley Cup game on for us Bolts fans
- Taking care of Toddler food/drink needs before even asking
- Refilling our drinks as soon as they were close to running out
- Providing us suggestions around town at the end of the dinner
- We forgot our toddler’s police car and she even picked it up, then happened to get us the car the next morning before the restaurant opened up allowing us to continue our morning vacation plans.

Cannot speak more volume about our server!

Oh and the food? One of the best burgers we’ve ever had and the fried green tomatoes were DELICIOUS (I don’t even like tomatoes)

Restaurant was clean and didn’t feel crowded inside restauranrt despite being full.

Definitely coming here when we visit again! Eat Local!",5
"The parking was a small problem. The wait was pretty much expected. But however the waiters at the front door we're so ridiculous rude,  if we had not been with a family of eight, and already had waited over 45 minutes we  would of walked out . We were talked to like we were children in elementary school with them holding the upper hand. It was put to us like if we didn't like it we could all leave. Because we were talking with our family members. No children were with us so it was not loud. You can bet I want go back and will make sure I will let anyone else know how we were talked to. I ask if the waitress to hold a tee shirt and mug I had picked out int'l we finished our dinner. Her response was it's first come first serve I can't hold it. Well at this point we had plenty of time so I paid for it took it to my car and returned waiting. We were told to wait outside due to we had to many in our party after 45 minutes. WHAT??? He was so rude. We ignored and stood inside. Understand it was before Thanksgiving and cold. For me and my family we are
done with the Goat!!!",2
"Loved this place. Food was great and the service was amazing. My daughter got the burger with peanut butter and fried bananas, sounds strange but she loved it and apparently it’s a popular menu item.  Now the fried deviled eggs stole the show. AMAZINGGGGGGG!!!!",5
We had deep fried deviled eggs... Not too bad. We also had teryaki kabobs and they were fantastic. My only real complaint is ee had to wait 85 minutes to get a seat on a Wednesday evening at 630p. If people have to wait THAT long there should be more seating outside maybe for dining certainly for waiting. Maybe even have someone bring out some pitchers of water when it's hot. In that situation they are no better than any other establishment but it's that the goal? To do the same as the other guys? Step it up and earn repeat business. Still.... Five stars.,5
Top notch quality food. Everything is made in house. They even make their own ketchup and it is unique and delicious.,5
"Cool place with a fun atmosphere. Everything is made and sourced locally all the way down to the ketchup.  Our server was very friendly and attentive. I had the blackberry mule and my hubby had the Tail of the Dragon. It arrived under a glass dome filled with smoke and the drink had a true smoky flavor, very cool. The burgers were good.",5
"All I can say about this restaurant is wow! We had a party of six and decided to go all out on our food. We ordered 5 appetizers and 6 entrees and every single thing was amazing from the steak nachos and the fondue to the Elvis burger and ribs with their mashed potatoes. Whipped sweet potatoes were amazing. This restaurant is super popular at pretty much all hours of the day, so expect a wait, but it is completely worth it!",5
I make sure to eat at Local Goat when in Pigeon Forge everytime. Food is always delicious and drinks are works of art,5
"Passed this place many times and the parking lot was always jammed from open to close. Finally, made reservations and had lunch there today. Man...now I know why! I'm a chef and restaurant owner and am not easily impressed, but they exceeded all my expectation! The Shrimp and Grits were fantastic as was the Teriyaki Kabob. Started with Fried Green Tomatoes with Goat Cheese and Bacon Jam and finished with Bread Pudding. Everything was expertly prepared and service was relaxed but attentive. We will be back as often as possible!",5
Highly Recommended! The parking lot was packed but the wait time was not long at all. The food was amazing!,5
"Fast, efficient, friendly service. Nice beer list. Loves the pretzel pieces with the fondue. The food was tasty and I could only eat half of my shrimp and grits. We enjoyed trying the goat milk hand lotion that is for sale there and my husband bought a bottle.",5
Really great place.  The food was delicious and service was excellent.   Make a reservation or you will be waiting a long time.   We will definitely be back next time we are in the area.,5
Nice place it was packed. Enjoyed the Billy Burger with fries. The server was nice and helpful.,4
Great food for the price. Christopher D. took great care of the family. He made sure we always had what we needed.,5
"We made reservations the day before & got seated right away on Friday for lunch.  Food was delicious, we had Whiskey burger (need a big mouth to get in your mouth!) & the fettuccine Rocco was very tasty (the portion is family size - really!!) + service was good.  Absolutely deserves 5 stars.",5
Great food just don't go unless your hungry. They will feed you a good portion. I had bake tater steak and salad. That was great but was stuffed.,5
"This restaurant is VERY busy. Every time we drove past, the parking lot was always packed. I got the Autumn Salad and was not disappointed. So good!  We also ordered a side of onion rings to share. They were the biggest onion rings I’ve ever seen. Very tasty too!",5
"Great place. Great atmosphere and Super nice stuff!!!!!
Minus one star for burgers being little bit too dry",4
"They had really good food. It's there I would recommend the deep fried deviled eggs as an appetizer. My wife and I split a smokehouse burger and fries in addition to the eggs.

Portions were generous, and the service was great! Our server, whose name was Jeff, was cheerful and fast and anticipated our needs.

Yes, we would definitely go there again next time we are in the area.",5
"This was our second visit to The Local Goat and it was excellent again. Almost everything on the menu is farm-to-table and/or made from scratch at the restaurant.

I had the BGT Burger and a Breakfast Juice IPA (brewed down the road in Gatlinburg). The burger comes with goat cheese and delivered an amazing taste. The beer menu is an excellent selection of local brews that anyone can find something to like. The menu has some nice options for GF diets. Reservations recommended",5
"Very busy establishment but worth the wait. Ended up eating at the bar. Good food, good drinks. Bar staff was top notch.",5
"Food was great, and so was the service. I was also impressed with the drink selection, specifically bourbon.",5
The best restaurant in pigeon forge hands down everything from walking in to leaving was amazing if your in town definitely recommend this place I can’t wait to go back please get the fried deviled eggs,5
Great Food! If you're reading this and thinking about trying it! Try it! So good!,5
"The green tomatoes are not breaded and fried like they should be, they were hard to cut. The peppers on the starter page were definitely under par. The coleslaw was very bland. The shrimp and grits would have been OK except for the sauce they put on it. My mom's fish had hard pieces of white fish in it. We really wanted to like it 😪",2
"Parking was a nightmare, we circled the parking lot like vultures waiting for ppl to leave. We soon found out why though. Excellent food, service, and drinks. Honestly hands down the best food around the area. Highly recommend the fried green tomatoes and fettuccine Rocco! For drink definitely the Bloody Mary!",5
"Food is good, craft beer was good, servers were friendly.  What more could you ask for",4
"Everything made fresh, amazing food amd great service. Must go to spot if your in pigeon forge TN.",5
"On vacation here in Tennessee and heard about this place bynerous times so we had to try it out. Definitely smart to book a reservation first.
7oz sirloin with grilled shrimp.
Steak was very tasty, melt in your mouth good.
Not pictured was my drink ""Tail of the Dragon"" which was really good as well, Jack Daniel's cocktail that they serve smoked, was a unique twist on a good drink.
Would highly recommend and we'll definitely come back if we are ever in the area again.",5
"Absolutely delicious. Made a reservation because I knew they’d be slammed. But the food was amazing, service and atmosphere were great. Overall a wonderful time for everyone.",5
We were greeted by a host named Zach he was not a very friendly person Zack informed us he had five job offers Zack should take one of these other jobs and hopefully one that he doesn’t have to work with people. Olga was our waitress she was very sweet and very good waitress the food was very tasty as well unfortunate that we had to start it off with Zak,2
"Food was amazing, waitress was awesome and friendly. Not bad prices...HIGHLY recommend.",5
"First time eating here. Parking lot is always full.. parking is crazy when busy. 90% of the menu is made in house & locally sourced. That is a plus. My smoke house burger was ok, warm at best. My wife's crab & shrimp bisque was good & my daughter's ribeye was good... The creme brulee was ok...over all it was ok.. I'm glad we stopped in finally, but won't be back unfortunately..",3
"Staff was helpful, polite and well dressed! Our server gave great recommendations and was very patient!
Totally recommend for a fantastic local restaurant!
The Bourbon selection was incredible.",5
"Could not be more pleased with our experience! The food was fabulous.  Loved every bite.
This is a must from now on when we visit.",5
Great food. Good service. Clean eating area. Very good waitress. Fair priced. 30 to 45 minute wait times without reservation.,5
"Omg!! This restaurant has the best food!! I see why they're always busy. While visiting we stopped here and we were not disappointed. I had the crabcakes BLT, delish!! My fiance had the TN whiskey wings, bomb! We also had the spinach dip, one of the best I've had. Highly recommend this place.",5
This place did not dissapoint everything we had was good. You have to try the onion rings. They were crispy and the sauce that went with it was the best I ever had. Really wish I had the recipe for that.,5
"Great service, great food. Recommend that you go!",5
"Today was our first time there. Parking and wait time is overwhelmingly limited at rush hours, due to an obviously popular place. We had the pleasure of seating our large party right by the kitchen doors. The food was FANTASTIC. Even with a large group, our food was delivered moments after our appetizer. The gentleman expediter in the kitchen with an adidas hat was amazing at his job. In all my years of restaurant reviews, he was the most impressive that I have ever seen. The food leaving the kitchen was at a break neck pace and all the dishes I saw pass by me had uniform presentation. WE WILL BE BACK TO DINE HERE AGAIN.",5
Burger meat was plain without seasoning. Everything else was amazing! Was told that 95% of their food is made out concocted in- house. Loved it!!!!!,5
"The best restaurant in Gatlinburg area! My husband and I had a hard time finding restaurants in the area that we both loved. Local goat exceeded our expectations. The food is all in house made with local resources, and it shows. My husband got the whiskey glaze burger, and is still talking about it. I ordered the Alfredo and it was absolutely amazing. Our waitress was absolutely amazing. All staff was extremely accommodating. We definitely will be back!",5
Amazing! All local sourced. Everything made fresh daily!,5
Very good food good service waiters were nice only prpblem is the line outside,5
Nice place good food. Came here for a visit. Had shrimp and grits and the smokehouse burger.,5
"Can't talk enough about this place. Service was excellent!! Food was absolutely delicious.  Homemade everything, all the way down to the buns and condiments. The fastest service I have ever experienced when eating out!!! Will absolutely be back!!!",5
Good food good atmosphere. About a 30 min wait but worth it,4
The fried deviled eggs were great. I ordered the Lamb Burger (see photo) and onion mashed potatoes. It was good. My wife had the Pimento Burger and fries. The regular fries were nothing special. They were more like bits of fries.,5
"We had a large party of 10. It took an hour wait but that was normal this week. Friendly staff, great atmosphere. Attentive server kept all our drinks full and was very fast with orders, service, and checks. Most of our dishes were excellent. Ahi sandwich was a bit dry. Chicken sandwich was lacking in flavor. Onion rings are massive and tasty! Mushroom burger was good, as was the bisque. Salads are big and very good. I would go again!",4
Always full.  And worth the wait.  They take reservations.  The fpod was excellent and service great. Our party of 4 ordereda variety of dishes and we all loved them.  The Elvis mudslide was awesome!  Will definitely come back.,5
Food was great.  They make 99% of their own sauces and prepare their own food. They cut the steaks in house. Good fresh food and it was fast.,5
"Great hamburger, fries not so good.",4
This place was one of our favorite places we ate at In pigeon forge on vacation I got a burger and so did my daughter they were fabulous. Husband got some steak medians dish and it was amazing and steak cooked to perfect medium. We will definitely be back next time we are in town.,5
Wow this place is outstanding...food drinks atmosphere prices...let me tell you the ribs are the best I have ever had meat just comes right of the bones juicy mouth watering finger licking good.my wife had the shrimp and grits with a salad with home made salad dressing she said it was really good.of course my son had the steak and fries and my friend had a big burger..they both saut it was really good as well.i must say this make reservations way ahead of time to enjoy this gem of a restaurant.service was A plus.price was on point restaurant was clean as well as the restroom,5
"Best restaurant I've been to in a while.  I was full half way through but kept eating for taste.  Only complaint was finding parking. But if you're that good, that will usually be a problem.",5
"My husband and I went there this past week for dinner. He had ribs that literally fell off the bone and I had the Southern Salad-Loved it! We also ordered the beer dip with pretzels, apples and bread and Everything was Amazing!! Our waiter, Jeremy P, took the time to explain the history of the place to us, despite how busy the place was-greatly appreciated and wonderful service! Hope to visit there again when we are down that way.",5
"This place has the best burgers in the area, their fries are excellent also. Don't let the full parking lot fool you to believing there will be a long wait, they do a great job getting people seated quickly. I highly recommend the Smokehouse burger and the Tennessee whiskey burger!",5
"I enjoyed my dining experience at The Local Goat. The food is Awesome! It's  a Popular place, so there's  a small wait to be seated.",5
Everything was delicious! I loved my lamb burger. We also had their wings-- which are out of this world!,5
Decent food and quality ingredients. It will be a happy upgrade to visitors without these types of options near their homes. My hamburger crumbled which lost the experience of a great meal. My caramelized onion mashed potatoes had no flavor. The hamburger buns were cool and fries were plentiful. Overall it was just ok.,3
"This place was amazing! It is often very busy and now I can see why. The panko crusted fried deviled eggs were a favorite for the entire table. And the seared ahi Merlin sandwich with a side of caramelized onion mashed potatoes is totally recommended. The entire place was beautifully decorated for Christmas.
$85.00 for 4, not including tip or liquor.",5
"Our service was excellent, believe his name was Constantine and he had a trainee with him, they kept our drinks full and made sure our experience was great. My husband and I both loved our food, you can't beat a scratch kitchen! We also tried the deep fried devilled eggs and we surprised how well we liked them!",5
Good food and even better service.,5
This place right here has amazing food and great service. We had shrimp and grits and the kid had ribs. Man it was good! Highly recommend,5
Second time here and we absolutely love it! Their fried deviled eggs are killer! We also got the farmhouse burger which was delicious. Highly recommend,5
"I hate to leave a one star review because the Elvis burger was oddly delicious, but after specifying a gluten allergy for my son and I and asking for gluten free buns, we were served regular buns while being told they were gluten free. We were a party of seven my sister and I both ordered the Elvis, mine on a gluten free bun. Both of our kids ordered the kids cheeseburger, our son's on a gluten free bun. When our food came out, the waitress that delivered our food put mine in front of me and said ""Here's the Elvis on a gluten free bun."" There was a blue pick that was in mine and not my SIL so I figured that was the allergy tab. Then my son was delivered his burger and I noticed that his did not have sesame seeds on his like mine did. Luckily our waitress came over and I asked. Both my son and I were served the wrong buns which would have caused a horrible allergic reaction. Absolutely not acceptable at all.

Photo of the Elvis Burger on a gluten-free bun.",1
The food  was good  and the service  was  better!  They use locally  sourced  food and products!,5
"Love this place, the deep fried deviled eggs are amazing chicken Rocco is awesome! Loved it and be warned it's always busy!! And for good reason,  good job local goat and staff!",5
"I got the GBT burger (goat cheese, bacon, and something else I don't remember). It and the fries were amazing! We had to wait about 40 minutes, but their text system allowed us to take the kids to the car and hang out, so that wasn't an issue. I took one star because the waiter never checked on/refilled our drinks, but the restaurant was packed, so he was busy and I didn't get a chance to grab him to ask. I'll definitely eat here again when I'm in town!",4
"Our family waited an hour to eat here but it was worth the wait. One of the best restaurants in the area. Good, quality food. Cool atmosphere. Management was nice and professional. Chicken pasta dish was amazing! Everyone in my party kept eating from my plate. Steak, chicken wings and sides were made perfectly. However, the shrimp and grits was horrible and the worse we’ve had thus far. And we love shrimp and grits. Don’t do it! Otherwise, great place to eat but do yourself a favor and book a seat ahead of time. They don’t do takeout either which is disappointing.",4
"Great service, and the food was amazing! We recommend the deep fried deviled eggs for appetizers! Definitely a must try!",5
For what we paid the food was GARBAGE!! I wasn't impressed At ALL!! The pork chop was TOO thick and should have been butterflied and the waitress brought the wrong side dishes twice. I HATE paying for INCOMPETENCE and LACKLUSTER FOOD!!!,1
We weren’t impressed with the restaurant which was sad because it came really highly recommended from friends and locals. I got the ahi tuna and felt everything was a little undercooked. The best part was the mashed potatoes!,2
The food was excellent however there is no point on making a reservation because you still have to wait. We ended up waiting entire wait time for those that just walked in and when I asked how much longer I got an attitude from the woman up front. Great place to eat at just don’t waste your time with a reservation and also parking is terrible.,3
"Noticed the parking lot was always full while vacationing in the area and decided to give Local Goat a try. So very glad we did. The food and service were both excellent.   Our server, Brandon, though soft spoken,  was pleasant and very knowledgeable about all of their drinks, 22 of their 24 beers were locally brewed  and offered excellent suggestions from the menu. He was very attentive and frequently made sure we had everything we needed and were happy with our drinks and food.  Whiskey wings and shrimp and crab bisque were impressive.  Steaks were perfectly prepared.  Portions were large.  When in the area we will definitely be  back.",5
Great food.. Large portions too! They use real containers for take out and leftover food.,5
"Wow, I'm so glad we got to eat here before we leave tomorrow.   Make sure you are hungry when you go....their servings are big!  We ordered the fondue for appetizer, very delicious!  I had the chicken teriyaki for dinner while my husband got the sirloin.  Everything was so good, even down to the iced tea!  We had a 30 minute wait, but everything was well worth the wait!",5
It doesn't help at all to have a reservation here. Had a 11:15am reservation. They sat everyone else that didn't have a reservation and made us wait 45 minutes. We were on seated after asking many times when we could sit. Empty tables everywhere. Totally incompetent host. Our waiter Robert C was awesome. They need more people like him.,2
Great food and service. The deep fried deviled eggs are a must! Ahi tuna entree was phenomenal and we stopped it off with peanut butter pie!,5
"Jeff, our waiter, was very pleasant and friendly.  My husband and I shared a sandwich and fries because the portions are soo large.
We ordered the deep fried egg appetizer, wonderful!!  Egg whites are deep-fried, topped with egg salad and a piece of bacon.
No social distancing whatsoever at this restaurant. Every table was full with no barriers between the booths.
However, they do have a touchless menu. See my pic.",4
Great food.  Make sure to plan ahead and make reservations.,5
"The service, the food. The best in Tennessee!",5
Super nice restaurant with everything made from scratch. I tried the teriyaki kabobs and they were fantastic. Would highly recommend you to try!,5
"We waited 1hr for terrible overpriced food! ***These onion rings were the WORST onion ring I have ever had in my mouth and I love onion rings!! They had a sour taste. I took one bite, nope so gross!! I told the sever & he seemed to not care. My 15yo ordered chicken tenders & fries she liked them. My 11yo ordered Mild Chicken Wings. I tried them & they had absolutely NO flavor, I had 1 and he had 1 so we ate 2 out of 10). I told the waiter and he asked if my son would like to have something else. He tried the kids chicken tenders and they was good. Got the check & was charged for the onion rings but they did take off the chicken wings and charged us for the replacement kids meal. The PROS- fried deviled eggs (but was a little firm) (7/10) & my Teriyaki Kebabs (9/10). I’m not sure why anyone would rate this above a 3 star. When you have an appreciation for good food it’s such a disappointment to pay for subpar food!! It’s hard to beat homemade food. People just don’t care what they eat or serve anymore. Also, the main dining room lack any charm or decor it looked so plain and like buffet seating, super boring!",2
"The restaurant staff was friendly and our waiter was amazing. The aged steaks are great choices here. I ordered appetizers and had hair in my food, and so did another person which ruined my appetite. Other food items that were tried was salmon and battered fish which was a little bland.",2
"I am STILL chasing ribs as good as these ones! I absolutely REGRET not getting a full rack.

SOS please ship me some of your sauce!

Dying to come back hopefully some day",5
The food was awesome and the wait staff were nice and kept a good eye on your drinks so we never had to wait on a refill.,5
Food and service were amazing. I had the gouda cheese bacon and bbq sauce hamburger. The onion rings are huge.,5
Fried Eggs and Fried tomatoes awesomeness :)),5
"Its good but cold, food was good! and our waitress was nice I would recommend it! But come early because it’s a good wait if you come late. but it’s worth it!!",5
"Best food we had in Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge. Great drink selection too! We noticed that the parking lot was always full whenever we passed by, so we decided to find out why. Now we know! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼",5
I had the lamb burger. It was the best seasoned burger i have ever had. So tasty. Fries were great too. Great service at the bar,5
Shrimp and grits were excellent! Clinch River cooler was delicious! My husband had wanted wings but they were out due to everyone else wanting them too! His black and blue burger and fries were still very delicious!!!,5
"So delicious 😋 The portobello mushroom burger, coconut shrimp & Ahi tuna are the best! The cocktails 🍹 are excellent too! Be sure to make a reservation ahead! Get here early! Parking is tough!",5
"Connie and I came here to celebrate our anniversary.
Definitely fantastic meal !  Our server, Derrick was great. I asked his recommendation on the local brews and was not disappointed in his choice. Going back in 2 days !!",5
Great place! Awesome food! Great customer service!!,5
"This was my first time eating at the local goat, and it surpassed all of my expectations. From the food to the drinks and the service, it was phenomenal. Our sever Austin B. was beyond attentive, offered great recommendations and was on top pf every need from the time we sat down to the time we leaved. The food came out fresh, generously portioned, hot and everything we ate all truly tasted great. I felt like the menu was priced very adequately. If you are looking for a date night, girl’s day or in town for a family vacation, I highly recommend you stop here!",5
"Great food!  Best steak I've had in a long time.  Onion rings were amazing,  get the half order if it's only 2 people eating an appetizer.",5
Very crowded  - but we were able to set at the bar. Food was just ok. Waitress was nice. Seemed to be organized. Nacho were just fair. We wouldn't order them again. Beer was good and cold.,5
Fantastic food and service every time!,5
Good was awesome. Friendly service,4
"The ribs literally fall off the bone. Hands down best ribs I’ve ever had. Staff were all very professional, knowledgeable, and just downright good at what they do. Our server Justin was the man! Give him a raise! This was recommended to me, and I highly recommend it myself! Had several issues throughout our trip with dining in the area, but Local Goat made sure we knew we were in the right place. Thanks for the wonderful dining experience.",5
A unique dining experience.  Always crowded make reservations.  My wife said she had the best steak she has had in years.  Chicken sandwich great; however the bun did not hold up. Great selection of brews and drinks. Very good sweet tea.  Server very nice.  A bit expensive but overall a great choice for a birthday meal.,5
This place was incredible. The food was delicious and our server was wonderful. I got the salmon and it was cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed just right. I would highly recommend this restaurant,5
"Five stars all around. Tennessee Whiskey Glazed Wings, Cheese Fondue, Onion rings, Fettuccine Rocco (My lady ordered that, can't remember if that's the name), Fish & Chips (My favorite along with the wings) were all SPOT ON. As well as the Marzen tap beer. Since being in Tennessee for vacation we've tried many places so far but this by far is my favorite of them. Service was excellent & even with there restaurant filled they knocked the food out.",5
The Local Goat was recommended to us by a local as the place all the permanent residents eat.  We loved it so much we went two nights in a row.  You must try their fried deviled eggs!! Also shrimp and grits was extraordinary and BBQ ribs the meat so tender and fell from the bones.  The service was also genuinely nice.,5
Absolutely phenomenal food! We had the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and the Hawaiian ribeye steak for dinner. The service is impeccable! The food delicious and the atmosphere is comfortable whether you want to dress up or dress down. This is definitely going to be a repeat visit if we are ever back in TN!,5
"The food was great. It was packed. Unfortunately, there wasn't much social distancing in place. So, go at your own risk. My boyfriend and I decided to go soon after they opened to avoid the crowds.",4
"The fried green tomatos was great but the rest was - ok. The onion rings was too oily that we cant even eat them.
Kid menu at 5$ was nice and also the hamburgers.",4
Food was great a little pricey but worth the long wait,4
"I'd give this restaurant 6 Stars if that was a thing. Huge portions. The steak was so tender you could cut it with a spoon. No need for steak sauce and I use it everytime for every steak. Its not needed here. Great ranch for the salad, you know, that GOOD ranch. This place has it! The chicken sandwich was creamy, cheesy, melty, Juicy! Shoe string fries were cold but still crispy. Just...ahhh..just amazing!",5
"Dry overcooked burgers, ordered medium came way overcooked and dry (both my wife’s and mine) Her’s no Blue Cheese on the Black & Blue, mine no BBQ Sauce on the Smokehouse burger. Fries like cardboard, Mack and Cheese so dry you could hardly eat it. Waited over an hour for food I could have cooked better after a twelve pack… only good thing about this place was a great selection of Beer…",2
"Seated early for our reservation. Onion rings are huge and delicious. Ariel is fantastic. Food was good. The restaurant was very cold, making the food get cold too. Felt a bit rushed. They flip tables as fast as possible.",4
"Sadly, we were a bit underwhelmed by this local favorite. Food was good, and no complaints. Just nothing special or exciting, in comparison to
other meals while in town. My husband said his Ribeye was delicious. Person checking people in at the door was rude, when we arrived and gave him our reservation time. We were a large group of 13 and offered to split up into two groups, based on our two separate reservations. We still waited almost 45 minutes for a table.",4
This place was awesome! Practically everything is made from scratch and you can taste how much better it is because of this. We tried the fried deviled eggs and they were delicious! And I went on an Elvis kick and did the Elvis burger and the Elvis Slide drink... freaking amazing! Come visit this place!,5
"Amazing everything! Delicious food, good price and amazing service! If you are in town come and eat here !",5
"The food was great! And the customer service was even better...!!! We were waited on by a young lady named Megan,  who gave 150 percent customer service. The food was so great,  I am mad I didn't order another one to go. This is definitely a great spot to eat at if you are ever in the area.",5
"The food here is AMAZING! The cheese fondue was my favorite. We also had the deep fried deviled eggs which were great as well. Server was Ben and he was AWESOME! I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area. Their might be a wait but trust me, it will be worth it!",5
Had lunch there the other day it was great!! They follow all PPE protocols. They were friendly in the restaurant and I felt safe and the restaurant was very clean. Now let's talk about the food it was wonderful I hada wonderful experience. I will be back.,5
We decided to try it based off a ton of recommendations from a foodie group I'm in. We were seated as soon as we arrived. Food was great! Loved the deep fried deviled eggs and steak nachos. Lamb burger was great too. My daughter said her wings were good. My son liked his bbq chicken sandwich. Serving size was good. Service was good until the end when the waitress took the plate my mom was still eating off of and we waited 15 minutes for 1 to go drink.,4
"This place was amazing, everything is so fresh. I recommend going in-between lunch and dinner so the wait is not as long. This place is always packed.",5
"If I could give it 6 stars I would, so so so good. The BGT burger was amazing and the fries were perfection. The half slab of ribs was huge and tender and fall off the bone. Reasonable prices and great service. Could not recommend enough.",5
"Fantastic food, but stressfull parking. You will circle the parking lot like a vulture until someone leaves and there is a good chance a person will try and take that empty spot before you can get to it. People will park in the grass and in the ""tow away zone"" which makes it harder to move through the parking lot by turning it into a one way. People will be facing each other in the parking lot, honking at each other until someone reverses back into the line. If you find a space easily, then thank god. Also alot of the workers there seemed very stressed out. Our waitress was stressed, but we were nice to her and I think it helped some.",4
Great food and good service,5
"Delicious food and excellent service. A definitely must visit in Pigeon Forge. Waiting time wasn’t bad considering how busy the place was when we got there.
Everything was made perfectly as we requested. The server went above and beyond when he asked if we had any food allergies or if certain ingredients are not suitable from a religious point of view.",5
Best steak me and the 4 other people I was with have ever had in a restaurant. Burgers were amazing and drinks were great! Very highly recommend coming here if your in the area!,5
The Deep Fried Deviled Eggs are superb 👌 Service was great like the food,5
They don't offer takeout but their food is unique and tasty. We got the Fettuccini Rocco and the BGT Burger.,4
This place was absolutely amazing! We made a reservation at 5 and it was packed! I definitely recommend everyone make a reservation because we only had to wait 5 minutes max. We ordered the cheese fondue appetizer and it was absolutely amazing! It reminded me of the Melting Pot and the staff was even kind enough to bring us extra pretzel bread after we ate it all! The Maui Chicken was so good and was the best thing I’ve eaten in Pigeon Forge/Gatlinburg! The steak and shrimp were also equally amazing! The staff was so nice but the only drawback is for those worried about COVID-19 since the staff did not wear masks. However I will definitely be back here again!,5
Food was good and our waiter was great. Person at the front wasn’t very friendly. We had a large party and had to wait quite a while (almost an hour) to even be seated although we did have reservations like suggested. Maybe it would’ve been better with a smaller party.,3
Went here while on vacation the parking lot was PACKED but still decided to see wait time. They were able to get us in ( 6 top) immediately. Service was quick. Food was good. Especially enjoyed the shrimp appetizer. My boys loved the French fries.,4
"Amazing place for all ages, especially adults.",5
The food is excellent all the way! The service for perfect from the host to the server. We will be back for sure!,5
"""Is this love, that I'm feeling... Is this the love that I've been searching for"" - Whitesnake

Delicious AND locally sourced!! Need I say more? I will anyway...
I watched this restaurant stay busy for HOURS and had to know why. The wait was a little long when we went (around 7 p.m) but well worth it.
If anyone asked me what salad I could eat for the rest of my life, I would say the side salad at Local Goat. I have no idea what their secret is, but it alone was worth an hour wait.
We ordered the ribeye and baked potato.
Have you ever seen a beautiful baked potato? Ever had one melt in your mouth? If you answered no to either question, then you need to visit Local Goat!
The ribeye... I almost have no words. The flavor was... simply put, AMAZING! The whole steak could have been cooked wrong and I would have forgot about it once I tasted it. However, it wasn't, it was legit perfection.
The wait staff was wonderful, friendly, attentive, and informative.
If you have a bucket list, put eating at Local Goat on there. My future trips to TN will include a stop every time (with a reservation) to eventually try everything on the menu.",5
Food was delicious.  Portions were good for the price.  Wait was average for the Pigeon Forge location.  Wait staff was friendly.  Drink menu offered many options to satisfy.  Seems like a better option for an adults only meal.,5
absolutely worth the 1hr wait to get in and eat an amazing dinner with my sister and cousin while visiting dandridge area!! hands down the best place I've ate at in all of tennessee!! a must do if your ever in the area!!,5
Fantastic food and service! We went here because a) it's not a chain and b) it was the only thing open late. We were very impressed.  We were in this cute room with fairy lights. Everything was great.  We will be back next time! (Forgot to get pre-dining food pics).,5
"The best restaurant in Pigeon Forge.   We could only stop once this year.  A random humorous comment to someone I wasn't even sure was an employee turned out to be the owner.   She was a personable, intelligent, caring individual who I was very glad to see was doing well in the aftermath of the pandemic.   In talking to the waitress we found out that they kept almost all of the employees on the payroll throughout the year. Everyone loved their food, the best of the more than 10 highest rated restaurants we have visited in the area.",5
"Update: went here on Thanksgiving weekend! Still amazing. I had the Elvis burger, which is a burger topped with peanut butter,  fried banana, and smoked bacon. Very different but good. This is a must stop restaurant!

This place is amazing. Make reservations if you can. Food is unbelievable.  Drinks are so good they hit the spot! Prices are excellent for the quality of food you are getting. Highly recommend",5
"Absolutely Positively the Best for Service and Food Quality!  Our waiter, Jacob, was phenomenal and had our food out Ridiculously Fast!!! Highly Recommended!!!",5
"Short wait to get in on a week night.  Ribs were the best we've ever had. Service good,  everything else really good except the cold slaw but I suppose that's subject to one's own taste so we won't knock them for that.",5
This was by far one of the best restaurants we have been to! Everything from amazing staff to amazing food and drinks! Place is always packed but even when there is a wait for a table it is definitely worth the wait! 11/10!!,5
We have been several times before and were very impressed with the food. Unfortunately the day we went this year it was temporary closed for new employee training.,5
"Fried deviled eggs was very good, fried green tomatoes had a good taste. Shrimp and grits not so good!",4
Fettuccine Rocco is awesome. Huge serving.,5
"Very good food. Locally sourced, would eat here every chance I have.",5
"First time here at the Local Goat, and it was a very good experience. Food was great and service was great. Jenny was our waitress and she was amazing.",5
This is an absolutely a great place to eat. Food is awesome and our waiter was outstanding.He memorized everyone's  6 peoples food and drinks and our dinner was flawless. Thank you Michael your fantastic at your job.,5
"Although it looks like your average sports bar and grill, I quickly found out that The Local Goat is a little more than that. While they don't offer any four course meals for one price like other restaurants in the area such as The Old Mill, they don't have to because they stick with what they know best: great burgers. That's coming from someone who isn't a big burger fan!

I got the Tennessee whiskey glazed burger with fries and beer cheese. My girlfriend opted for the Maui chicken.

The burger was great and was gigantic. It came with Tennessee whiskey glazed, smoked bacon, and crispy onions, plus the usual fixins. The patty was delectably juicy and packed with flavor from the whiskey glaze. The fries were also great, with a small cut and nice crispiness. That said, the real star of the show was the side of beer cheese. It's hard to mess up beer cheese, but The Local Goat really does it right. If you get fries, I highly recommend ordering a side of beer cheese for dipping. You won't regret it.

My girlfriend's meal was a bit of a miss, but I chock that up to it not being the restaurant's specialty. The rice was okay and so were the chicken and mashed potatoes, but it seemed out of place for a burger joint. I think if we go back, she'll go with their specialty.

If you're looking for a great burger in the Pigeon Forge area, look no further than The Local Goat.",4
"Very good food, ample portions, excellent service.  Highly recommended.  Will visit again",5
"This restaurant was delicious and the service was perfect! The drinks were amazing, especially the mango mojito!! It’s honestly one of my absolute favorite drinks now. Next time we’re in Pigeon Forge, we will definitely be eating here again!! 😍",5
"My husband and I absolutely LOVED IT! We will most defiantly be back at the Local Goat! I would suggest making reservations- we went on a Tuesday night at 7pm and I’m not sure where it was harder to find parking, here or at a trail in the Smoky Mountains... shows you how good this place is! We had the cheese fondue appetizer, the Harvest Salad, and the Hawaiian Ribeye. SO DELISH. Did I mention it’s all locally sourced? Yep. Our server Shelly was so great! See you all next time!",5
"We had a reservation but was running late due to traffic.  We called ahead and they still held our seats until we arrived.  Granted we were late by about 15 minutes.  Great food, wouldn't mind going again.",4
"Good food, lots of beer choices and a warm friendly staff",5
"Always a must stop whenever we come to Pigeon Forge. Good variety of beer on tap and delicious burgers make for a good lunch. And they have plastic separators between tables to keep with social distancing rules. And waiters are all wearing masks. Overall, I highly advice eating here.",5
Always a good experience. Food was awesome and service was great.,5
Amazing hamburgers! TN whiskey burger did not disappoint. Try the housemade bread pudding with ice cream! It's like custard.,5
"(I hate giving anything other than a stellar review, but this was my experience, respectfully speaking.)

First impression was a very clean restaurant and a friendly, smiling, staff. This was nice. After being seated, I scanned the menu and saw immediately what I wanted. My dinner dish began with the small dinner salad, then later the shrimp and grits. For a 5-top we were served timely.

If I'm being fair with my critique, at best my meal was ok. Not bad, not great, not memorable, not something to willingly recommend. I ate about half my food then boxed the rest, which isn't my norm. (I'm a big dumb farm animal, meaning if you put it in front of me I'll eat everything.)

Our wait time was an hour plus, which sadly didn't justify the meal. I will give Local Goat another try in the future, but I likely would recommend eating at another restaurant, with a tastier menu, a much shorter wait time, (some place like Chapman's with a delicious Shrimp/Grits combo) if I'm being fair with my review.",2
Fantastic food as well as great atmosphere. I would definitely recommend a reservation since this place fills up super fast!!,5
This was our first experience. The Smokehouse Burgers were amazing and their fries were so good. Ask for ranch to dip them in. We will definitely be back.,5
"We were told to make reservations here while dining at another restaurant by a patron who could not get enough of the local goat. An out of towner himself, he had nothing but positive things to say and nothing to gain so we changed our dinner plans from somewhere I had been wanting to go to before we even made the trip down to pigeon forge. We made late reservations due to visiting family in the area, but we did not feel rushed. The food was great and we even saw the other diner we had seen the previous day! Great place for dinner plans and loved my steak!",5
"You would think it was great by all of the cars and people hanging out there. Waited in the car until they called. The waiter didn't check back and he was new. The steak was half fat, baked potatoes were cold, but salad was good. Not impressed with this restaurant but by all of the people, they must like it.",2
Food was excellent and so was the service. Highly recommend!,5
"This was the first place we ate on arriving to Pigeon Forge.  A local friend recommended we go here for dinner.  He warned us that it was extremely popular and there would likely be a wait and he was correct.  It wasn't too bad though, they said it would be 45 minutes but it actually was only like 25 minutes.

Our waiter Benjamin was pleasant and friendly.  Our daughter has a peanut allergy and saw that one of the burger has peanut butter on it so she was nervous about eating her.  Benjamin was able to reassure her that the food was all safe and they have separate handling procedures for that one burger.

We ordered the cheese fondue for an appetizer and it was so delicious!   The pretzel bread with the fondue was amazing.  I ordered the Billy Burger and it didn't disappoint. The menu was extensive with many unique options.  My wife was also very happy with her blackberry margarita.

Great place to recharge after a long road trip!  I look forward to going back next time were in Pigeon Forge!",5
The pasta and salad and burger was great but the fish and fries were way to greasy as for the service it was standard as for the decor it was very beautiful especially the Christmas tree,4
We weren't happy with our first visit over one year ago. This visit was fantastic. We had the Teriyaki Tenderloin at the recommendation from the server. It was great. I would certainly get it again. The deep fried deviled eggs (6) were as good as advertised! The service was outstanding.,5
"From the moment we got there, until we left, every interaction with employees was great! Our server James has the patience of a saint when it comes to my wife and all of the special needs that she has. The food is Amazing! We were in town for a week and came twice.",5
This is the best restaurant I have ever ate at and their food is fantastic its very busy but its busy because its the best place to eat in Tennessee,5
"Had the ribs ,Dry Dry ,Dry, Service was good. Friendly waiter. Not sure if I would fight that crowd and wait 30 mins for a table and Dry Ribs again. Seen another table sending the ribs back..",3
If you want to go I would highly suggest making reservations because this place is always packed. Service was really good and the deep fried deviled eggs and the bread pudding is a must!,4
Amazing food and service! Definitely worth the 1 hour + wait to be seated. Really cool atmosphere and decor. Will definitely recommend and be back. Come hungry cause portions are worth the price. Onion rings are amazing 🤤,5
"It's amazing and out waiter, Joshua B, was spot on. He even made my hot teas special! We will return! Worth the time and money.",5
"The deep fried deviled eggs were VERY mustardy. The spinich artichoke dip was awesome! Probably in the top 3 of best artichoke dip for me! The burger had a good flavor but it was filled with those hard rubbery pieces. Some of the bites were string-like and I had to pull them out of my mouth. The bread pudding dessert was awesome, but HUGE! This dessert could feed 3 people!",3
So delicious and our service was outstanding!!! Try the deep Fried Deviled eggs!!!,5
"Jeremy was awesome, very informative for local breweries and whiskeys. The food was good, sweet potato side was Fantastic along with the bisque! We were very impressed with 'The Local Goat",5
Great service great food every time been about 6 times or so. Recommend making a reservation days if not a month a head of time. Will be back!,5
The place was a little crowded but we were seated in 5 minutes. Service was quick and the food was absolutely amazing.,5
"Ok. Not real impressed with this place. Handcuff fries are amazing all the same size (frozen). Fish tasted more like fish sticks. Lamb burger was surprisingly dense, like it was mixed with something and pressed. I myself would not go back.",3
"Place was nice and clean and staff was friendly...that being said...
I ordered the pimento cheese burger and it was hands down the most disappointing burger lve ever had. Absolutely tasteless,  dry, stale bun and zero condiments....very very little pimento cheese...l was hugely disappointed.",2
Excellent service and food. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful.,5
"Really great food. Steak and grilled shrimp were perfectly cooked. We also tried their fried eggs, which are a must have. Now we have to find a recipe for those! Fried green tomatoes were great as well. Get their wings too!",5
"Ok I must admit that I am a serial restaurant person when I find the delicious consistency at a restaurant. I’m there at least once a week for lunch! Local Goat is awesome. It’s popularity means there will be a wait for a table, which is a good thing because if the food was bad there would be no wait. Gluten free options are on the menus or ask your server. The hot wings can be done grilled instead of breaded and they have a gluten free bun for hamburgers. The New Orleans shrimp appetizer can be ordered with a grilled gluten free bun. Prices are fair, great for families with children! Go just before noon or wait until after 2:30 for a shorter wait. Enjoy!",5
"Local gem! Amazing rib-eye and burger, ahi tuna appetizer was great, too! Definitely will be back.",5
"This place was great!! We got the appetizer of Fondue. It came with Granny Smith apples, pretzel bites, and French bread. Waiter even asked if we would like free refills of them to go with the remaining fondue. My boyfriend and I each got a hamburger, the Farmhouse and the Whiskey Glaze, and fries to go with them. The service was awesome and the manager even made it a point to help the staff with tables and to talk with customers, including us. Highly recommend this place and we will be coming back soon!!",5
"I was surprised seeing praise for the Local Goat everywhere.
The best part of the meal were the cocktails. The bartender made amazing drinks that tasted great. We tried a variety of food from the menu and all of it was very bland.
The service was hectic and stressful. They checked with us every 5 minutes and tried to rush us out as soon as possible. I used to wait tables and bartend so I know when people are trying to flip tables and don't care about you at all.
I would never go back, especially for the prices and how hard it is to get a table there.",2
Great food and awesome drink selection. Will eat here again!,5
Awesome service with excellent food and great prices. Have allergy friendly menu that is easy to choose from. What makes it even more enjoyable is knowing that most everything is from local suppliers and fixed/prepared daily in house.,5
The local goat has great food!,5
"Very impressed with food and service. Our server, Cameron, was very attentive and made our visit even more enjoyable. We will be back!",5
Great place to eat. This was our first time there but definitely not the last,5
Food was amazing and no way do you leave hungry.  If you do it is your own fault.  Almost everything there is made in house or bought local making it even better.,5
Heard great things about Local Goat so we decided to give them a try. Fried green tomatoes for the appetizer were some of the best we have eaten. My wife had the half rack of ribs and I went with the coconut shrimp. Both were very good. The service we had from Jessica was excellent. My only criticism was the noise level in the dining area was high but it was crowded. We had an hour wait to get in but it was worth the wait.,5
"Our first time there. We are from out of state. 3 kids and two adults. This was the first time in a restaurant where there were no complaints. Really good food, really good service. I was amazed as to how our food came out considering how busy it was. No complaints at all!",5
Worth the wait! Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Food was phenomenal!,5
"I had the salmon with baked potato. The salad was excellent, the salmon was perfect, but the baked potato was cold. Prices were low considering the location. Can't recommend the creme Brule.",4
"Great ribs, fried devil eggs, Elvis burger and crab cake not. Impressive beer list. Staff was very helpful and friendly.",5
Recently dined there while on vacation.  Excellent food and service.  I definitely will return when in the area.,5
"We selected the Local Goat for many reasons.   The menu look fantastic and loved the fact it is a local friendly business with in house menu items.  We are impressed.  We did make a reservation, which was extremely helpful.  Our appetizer, Deep Fried Deviled Eggs was a hit with our kiddos.  The House Salad with ranch was our next dish and was definitely more ingredients given than most restaurants.  My husband ordered the Coconut Shrimp was cooked to perfection.   I ordered the TN Whiskey Burger and left with a smile and a full belly.  We will be back the next time we come to the Smokies.  Make sure you grab a cute tshirt like we did!  Thank you for the friendly, efficient, and overall service.",5
Food was great and friendly environment.,4
"So when we arrived at Gatlinburg and asked around for the best Resturant we got one answer from different people , Local Goat . Owned by their master chief who cooks everything from scratch with ingredients wing all sourced locally and you can taste that in every bite . They are famous for their burgers which I was lucky to have , I ordered the patriot burger and man from the bun to the beef and the toppings , everything was super tasty , kids ordered also their famous Mac & Cheese , wings and everything came out perfect . They are super busy so make sure you have 45-60 minute wait time . Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is super cool .",4
"Probably the best option for eating out in Pigeon Forge. There was a 90 minute wait when we went, so you might want to go, get your name on the waitlist, leave and come back. The fried green tomatoes were great and the patty in the hamburger was soft and juicy. I got the Elvis burger which has peanut butter and fried plantains on it. There was too much peanut butter so it kind of overpowered every other flavor. Maybe less peanut butter or a lighter peanut butter sauce would be better. Their ketchup was amazing.",4
The burgers are just soooo lucious. All food is excellent. Great selection of beers. Staff very helpful,5
"The food was good. My family loved it . My mom loved the pasta so much that she will be going here again just to buy the pasta dish . My dad loved his steak meal and my brother loved his meal. MY MEAL was shrimp and grits , I STRONGLY do not recommend you get this meal. The grits was terrible and I had more seasoning than grits on my plate .  I was disappointed and honestly wanted to go back to the suite. My dad had a dry steak after he request medium well. We weren’t willing to wait for his meal again  after waiting an hour so the manager said he will get it done right now . The management is also great . He bought us the  steak and it was amazing .",4
"A nice way to crown a long weekend in Pigeon Forge area, especially after eating mostly various forms of Southern Comfort Foods for several days.
While it missed the mark a couple times, I still recommend the Local Goat for quality original and creative items, generous portions and well flavored dishes. We had to try the fun appetizer ""Deep Fried Deviled Eggs"", appreciated by all at the table. My Fettuccine Rocco had great potential but turned out a bit more bland than what the ingredients should have delivered. My friend praised his TN Whiskey-glazed burger on a home-baked bun, and my wife made a happy plate of her half-rack of baby back ribs. I could not resist to taste them living in the Memphis area and while the home made BBQ Sauce was original and delicious,  it could not make up for the fact that the ribs were oven-baked first before finished on the grill; not quite delivering the authentic smoked flavor one is accustomed of from Memphis-Style BBQ, but they were very tender and my wife made a happy plate. Love the fresh cut thin fries, generous and well seasonned. The Shrimp and Grits looked a little ""soupy"" from my perspective but praised by our fourth Guest. We finished the dinner sharing a giant portion of Bread Pudding topped with Ice cream and Salted Caramel Sauce, very much appreciated and big enough for all four of us.
Don't expect expert service but it was friendly enough and the timing was good. The Restaurant has kind of a neutral ambiance, comfortable enough but not memorable.
Price is as expected for this town and the upgrade from country foods. Count about $35 per person without alcoholic beverages for a full meal. So, not quite the Greatest Of All Time (G.O.A.T) but definitely worth planning a meal there if a few days in this area.",4
"First time there, I had a very large breakfast and had been craving onion rings. I ordered the appetizer yet didn't eat even a half of an onion ring due to them not being fully cooked.
The atmosphere, waiter and hostess were wonderful.",4
"It’s our favorite restaurant in pigeon forge (tied with pottery house) the steak kabobs, mashed potatoes, teriyaki chicken, steak nachos and macaroni and cheese are all very good",5
"You will not go wrong - this place was AMAZING in every way! Great tap/craft beer selection - I had the Kentucky bourbon barrel ale - SO GOOD! For an app we had the fried deviled eggs - SO GOOD! Wife had the ahi tuna salad, I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, and the kids had hot dog and mac/cheese - ALL OF IT WAS SO GOOD!! Lastly, why not wrap it up with dessert: peanut butter pie and a bread pudding....you guessed it: BOTH WERE SO GOOD!!! THANKS  FOR A WONDERFUL MEAL Y'ALL!!",5
Excellent service and delicious food!!! Will definitely be back!!!,5
"We have drove past The Local Goat multiple times and never stopped, why is beyond me because this place was amazing! We stopped in on 02/17/2020, we were seated right away and the service was amazing and attentive the entire time. We started with Spinach Artichoke Dip which was good but there was nothing special about it, I actually wish we had done the steak nachos instead. For dinner I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and he had the Bhaahhby Back Ribs, each came with a side of shoe string fries and both meals were amazing and full of flavor. i can't believe we had never tried this place and I only regret we didn't get to eat there more during our stay. The prices were fair of a sit down restaurant, I 100% recommend this place and we plan to stop again when we come back.",5
First visit. Maybe a 10 minute wait to be seated. Slow service once we were seated. The food was ok at best.,3
Best burgers in Tennessee! Our waiter was very friendly and helpful! 100% recommend there restaurant. And the bacon cheeseburger. Comes with lettuce pickles tomato aged cheddar and onion. Also EVEYTHING is either local or housemade. Amazing place to eat!,5
"Absolutely incredible menu choices, the burgers have a flavor like no other!  Our server was very gracious and prompt, we can’t wait to go back!",5
"If you can make a reservation, do so. Otherwise, plan to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to well over an hour. For an appetizer, we tried the Deep Fried Deviled Eggs. As weird as this may sound, they are a must try. Definitely a different take on deviled eggs, and worth it. My wife got a sirloin, with grilled shrimp, a salad, and cheese grits. Her salad came shortly before the meal, so she wasn't able to finish it. The steak was undercooked, but the shrimp and cheese grits were excellent. I got the Boneless Pork Chop (they were out of the apple and onion topping), with whipped sweet potatoes and broccoli. The pork chop was cooked perfectly, with an excellent flavor. The whipped sweet potatoes were delicious, and the broccoli was cooked well. For dessert, my wife got the chocolate lava cake to go, and I got the NY Cheesecake to go. The chocolate lava cake was good (probably would've been better in person), and the cheesecake was delicious, but a little too sweet for me. Overall, a great experience. Our waitress was wonderful, and we would definitely recommend it if you can get a table.",4
Me and my husband had a reservation for our 1 year wedding anniversary. Due to not even being able to find a parking spot to get into this restaurant (note there were cars parked in the grass and on the side walk) we went elsewhere..,1
"A great local eatery! Good drink specials, awesome burgers. Get there early for good seating because it is popular!",5
Completely overpriced. $14 burger with the stalest bun I’ve ever tried to eat. Watered down drinks. Had extremely high expectations based on the popularity of this establishment but it was a huge disappointment.,1
"We love The Local Goat. The food, atmosphere, and service is always top notch! I love the bacon cheese burger with fries! This is our first and last stop everything we come to Pigeon Forge!",5
"The staff were wonderful, all""farm fresh"" food cooked from scratch.  Nice combinations.  The steak nachos were awesome.",5
So worth the long wait. We had the Elvis burger and the whiskey burger and it was amazing. The bbq pork nacho fries are really good to. Service was fast and great and prices weren’t bad either. I would highly recommend.,5
"Everytime we drove by this place it was packed!! We made a reservation for later in the week so when we arrived, our wait was minimal. We had heard so many great things about Local Goat so we were excited to experience it ourselves. We all ordered burgers: I got the Billy Burger(mushrooms and Swiss) with mashed sweet potatoes, husband got the pimento cheese burger with mashed potatoes, and my daughter got the Elvis(peanut butter and fried bananas) with a loaded baked potato. The pimento cheese burger was VERY good, the Billy was good, but the Elvis with the peanut butter was very dry. The sides were all decent, but were not served hot. They were all barely even warm. Our burgers could all have been hotter as well. Our service was excellent and the restaurant was clean and decorated nicely. We would try it again but only with a short wait time.",4
The food was really good. The service was great,5
"Oh my gosh! Where do I begin? This was the best dinner in Pigeon Forge. Jeremiah, our waiter was trained to perfection. He waited on us and made sure everything was perfect from appetizer, drinks, main course, and desert. The entire staff was very friendly! Thank you for an awesome dinner!",5
Our food was delicious. Go early and beat the crowd. Jeremy did a fantastic job!,5
"Service is always good. Staff is very friendly and you are greeted within a minute after arriving. They close at 10:00 PM EST and we arrived around 9:45 PM, there was no hesitation in setting us. Our waiter was very attentive and the food was delicious. If you are in the Gatlinburg,  Pigeon Forge, stop by and you will be glad you did.",5
Wonderful food!  Excellent.  Good service and attentive staff.,5
Ate here during the Labor Day weekend.  Was about a 45 min wait to get seated but it was late in the night.  We had a large party so it was understandable.  Our service was great.  The food was good and it didn't take long to get to our table once our order was put in.  We had several kids with us so the kids meals were def a good size portion.  The burgers were very large.  They give you a lot to eat here.  If you liked this review please click the like button.,4
"Really good food, fast service,and very good staff.
The food is hot and very flavorful, good selection too!
Surprisingly tasty!",5
We had the Elvis burger and the shrimp lobster bisque soup. Very delicious meal! Soup could have been hotter and wait time was quite a bit longer than they said it would be. Otherwise excellent service & look forward to coming again!,4
"Didn't even wait to try a fried deviled egg before nabbing a picture to brag 😆 Locally sourced and they make most everything in house. Such friendly service, and large portions.",5
"For Vegans: I saw very limited restaurant options prior to coming to Pigeon Forge, but I saw another review here about the Schrute Burger which is a plant-based option. It was great!!! Just get no aioli. I added guacamole and it was awesome!

Also - we had a 30 minute wait on a Wednesday night. It was worth it. Great service as well.",5
Make a reservation! You can easily make one online at least a day in advance is my recommendation. Food is awesome with a great menu but I was upset that they removed the crab cakes from the menu. ☹,5
"Best meals we had in Pigeon Forge. During our week in this area we ate here twice, it’s always busy and worth the wait. Food was amazing and service excellent. We tried many items, disappointed in the fried green tomatoes, could use a good remoulade sauce. Burgers were all great, salads filling and excellent. Pictured is the Mediterranean salad and BGT burger, both items I’d get again.",5
"A enjoyed my meal & would definitely go back. A 40 minute wait, caught our group off 11 by surprise at 3pm on Thursday but was told by locals it was a must try, while here for a few days. Grits were very unique, sweeter than I've ever had but glad I tried them 🥰😋",4
Amazing food with great service!,5
"So I decided that I wanted to have dinner here this morning but unfortunately I couldn't make a reservation for dinner for the evening ( it said no slots available ) and the wait list wasn't available either. This was on their website btw. Finally around 4 pm I tried again and got a slot at 8 pm! I was so excited!
We got the deviled eggs without the bacon and they were so darned delicious!
I decided on the Hawaiian steak ( how could I not?! ) and it came with a salad and side. The salad was brought out first and thankfully after I asked Tiffany to leave off the bacon on the eggs she automatically asked if I wanted it off the salad too!
Anyway I initially ordered the baked potato ( again no bacon ) with the steak and my hubby ordered the Billy burger and asked to substitute the fries for the spinach but I interjected and said I wanted the fries so he skipped the spinach. A while later I asked Tiffany to substitute my baked potato with the spinach and she was ok with it!
Anyway the Hawaiian steak was DELICIOUS!!!! Like seriously, it was so frikkin good! It was reminiscent of the kalbi I lived in Hawaii! If you like steak then please get this! The spinach was pretty good too! The Billy burger was great, there was plenty of yummy melted cheese and grilled onion and mushrooms. It ofcourse needed salt and pepper first!
I wanted to have the molten lava cake but they had run out!!! I would definitely come back here again!",5
"Great food, worth the wait. The soft pretzel and cheese fondue were amazing!",5
Amazing!!! Best ribs I've ever had!! My wife loved the cod. Bread pudding over the moon!!! Jeremy server was supurb. A must try in pigeon forge.,5
It's very popular so you will have to wait. We waited an hour..... to be fair its also peek tourist season. The food did not disappoint and I was not even mad because of the wait. Once seated we were waited on in a timely manner and we did not have to wait forever for our food. Which was astonishing in itself for how busy it was. It's a must go to if your in the area!,5
"Very disappointing experience after reading so many great reviews.  We arrived at 5:40 pm for our 5:45 pm reservation but were not seated until 6:30 pm due to issues with our cell phone not receiving notifications that seating was available coupled with the fact that no one from the restaurant comes outside to call out names even though they ask you to wait outside.  I'm sure that we are not the only ones that have encountered this issue.  Our daughter's shrimp and grits were excellent.  However, my steak was ordered to be between medium and medium plus but was seriously past well done.  Our daughter in law's hamburger was also significantly overcooked.",1
I had the fettuccine Rocco it was great. My husband paid $30. For a ribeye steak that was not cooked to his liking. He wanted it cooked medium. It ended up one small corner medium the rest Well done to point hardly chew it. The Local Goat is on the bottom of our list. When hubby disappointed that means a no go!,2
"I had the Elvis burger. Best daggone burger I ever had! Our waiter Carlos was exceptional! If you visit this place be sure to try the Elvis burger! Who thought peanut butter, bacon & bananas could be so good on a burger? Oh and first time I tried deep fried deviled eggs.",5
"My wife and I noticed this place after it 1st opened and have kinda kept up with it's business and reviews, and have tried to eat here a couple times when we visited Pigeon Forge/Gatlinburg area without any luck. We finally got our chance and it lived up to our expectations and the many 5* reviews we've read. Highly recommend to anyone as they offer something for everyone. Majority of their menu is made from scratch with local ingredients which makes this place even better. Also the staff is so friendly, knowledgeable, and good at what they do. Awesome job to the employees and management!",5
The food was excellent and service was great. You definitely get your money's worth.,5
Food was amazing. Drinks were great. Our server was super friendly and had a lot of good recommendations! We may stop here again before our trip is done!,5
Awesomely Great food... The burgers are fabulous. Chicken fingers are good as well. I tried the Tavern chicken sandwich for the first time and it was delicious. Always a busy place and a family favorite. Covid precautions are in place.,5
"Great restaurant that does things the right way. They make all the food, condiments, dressings, even hamburger buns, in house. Reasonable prices, great service, and overall delicious food. If you’re looking for fresh, locally sourced food, this place is great. I recommend one of their many delicious craft burgers.",5
"5 stars. Food is fresh, seasoned and cooked to perfection. Dessert was one of the best I’ve ever had. Crab soup was amazing as well. Great atmosphere very clean.",5
"We had reservations and we were seated before our time.Was not disappointed with the food, it was great. It was our first time there,but definitely not our last.Great food and great service. Thank you.!!!",5
"We had burgers at the Local Goat that was absolutely delicious. I was excited to see whipped sweet potatoes as a side dish option which I ordered with my burger but got fries when my lunch was served. I agree they did make this right ;however,they were barely warm. When sent back and a new order brought back to me they still were barely warm .The waitress didn’t check back in on me to ensure the corrected dish was satisfactory so I was a bit disappointed with her lack of customer service. Needless to say I gave a tip the same as I would have regardless of her lack of excellent customer service.",4
We had a reservation that I had to make 2 days before for a table at 2:30pm. We got to the parking lot anticipating a parking issue at 1:50pm. Drove around the lot for 50 minutes along with multiple other cars. Had to keep backing out because cars were desperate and just driving in your direction. After we were 10 minutes passed our reservation time I called the restaurant to let them know out of curtesy that we would not be able to make it because there wasn't a single place we could snatch to park at. When the hostess picked up the phone we received no apology or anything. Rather an ok we took you off the list and being hung up on. Why make the seating capacity smaller than the parking lot can hold? We had planned our events of that day all around the reservation. It was truly a bummer we could not try the delicious food that everyone talks about. Maybe consider getting someone in the parking lot to help direct traffic?,1
Went here for the first time and fell in love! The fried deviled eggs are out of this world!! By far rhe best food I have ever eaten!!!,5
Food was outstanding and service was great despite the holiday week and being slammed for a Monday night.,4
"This place is a cornucopia of irony. The presentation was excellent, while the execution was terrible. While they were the most ""coviddy"" place we visited in Pigeon Forge, they also seemed the least sanitary. I think Waffle house may be more sanitary. Our waiter kept coughing and snorting phlegm due to his runny nose. He was visibly sick, yet still at work and still serving. My cup was dirty. And not the kind where you get a dish with something that stuck on it in the dishwasher, I think someone literally grabbed a dirty dish to serve my drink. The food was underwhelming and mediocre. Bottom line, they're not able to scale. Sidenote, it was sincerely freezing and customers kept complaining to the wait staff who said they didn't know how to turn it up. Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but this shouldn't happen to the degree it did.",2
Always great food!  Crowded with people vacationing for Thanksgiving. Worth the wait.,5
Excellent and friendly service. Our chef (Chad) made our food and the best ribs I've ever had. The drinks were fantastic. Everything here is made in house from the burgers and fries to the pickles and sauces. I will be making another 300 mile trip just to come here again. Do not miss out on this restaurant!,5
A little slow on service but worth the wait. Deviled eggs are awesome and the burgers are great.,4
Best shrimp and grits I have ever had. Love the fried deviled eggs.,5
"This is one of those restaurants where I read the reviews and said we should go and then the menu didn't catch my attention. We looked to go here for years but never did. After driving by the full parking lot for 3 days we finally decided that we needed to just bite the bullet and try it. OMG - Instantly regretted not doing it sooner! I imagine that everything on the menu is probably delicious. We got 2 appetizers, the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp and the 1/2 order of onion rings. Both were GREAT...But the shrimp...I don't know a word that could describe the way I felt about that shrimp...it was amazing..The flavors were just..perfect. I really can't say enough about that shrimp. Get it, seriously! My fiancé ordered a side salad and the Sriracha honey wings. Those things were SPICY!! Their wings are great though and the flavor is really good, just very spicy. I did the 7oz sirloin special that came with a choice of grilled shrimp, crab cake, or coconut shrimp. I chose the coconut shrimp. The dip it came with was wonderful! Their coconut shrimp reminded me of my very favorite Coconut shrimp at a restaurant called the Grapevine in Calabash, NC. It definitely didn't disappoint. The sirloin was cooked and flavored perfectly. The best sirloin cut I've ever had. I'm a filet girl, but it hit the spot! Our waitress was fabulous, I should have gotten her name. She was attentive and offered great recommendations!",5
Great food.  I had the Flame grilled rib eye and it was cooked to perfection.  The only thing we had a problem with was getting in and out of the parking.,5
"Came in to eat on a Monday night, and i have to say, it was all perfect! Our server, Elijah, was on point! Food came out in a very timely manner with perfection. Crème Brûlée was spot on as well!!! Definitely coming back. Ask for Elijah! He’ll take great care of you!",5
"Food was delicious, beers were cold and the service was great.",5
"Great 1st time visit to this farm to table concept restaurant with a rotating menu of regional craft beers and some unique cocktail creations.  Our waitress Mellonie, was stupendous and guided us down the path of gustatory greatness. Appetizers included a goat cheese stuffed red pepper that was simply sublime and breaded deviled eggs fried to crispy perfection.  Both the shrimp n grits & chicken alfredo dishes were equally tasty spinoffs of the traditional versions of the dish.  By the time I polished off my flight o suds and the meal had come to a glutinous end, I was bleating like a stuffed goat!",5
"Amazing! I had the shrimp and grits, and my husband had the BGT burger. Both about the best we’ve ever had. And our server Priscilla was awesome!  But definitely make a reservation online or be prepared to wait",5
Nachos were really good as well as the Tuna and Salmon entrees. Both were cooked perfectly.,5
Really worth the wait. Delicious burgers and fries!,5
Great Food! I had Fish and Chips and the fish wasn't Cod... It was Mahi Mahi! What?,5
"Good food and great service. I would recommend a reservation. We went at 4:30 in the afternoon and it was a half hour wait, but the food was worth it.",5
This place was amazing. I had the deep fried deviled eggs for an appetizer. They were better than I ever imagined they would be. We had burgers ad well which were very good. I highly recommend this restaurant. We will definitely go back next time we are in pigeon forge.,5
Very busy spot! Long wait. Make sure you put your name on the reservation list. This restaurant stay open later during other in the area. This is an American style restaurant,4
Food was good. Service was ok. Though she was friendly she ignored that we were having a birthday dinner. Had a get them in get them out feel.,3
"Wonderful service! We got there late and they let us in and still gave us outstanding, friendly service!",5
"Having grown up in the Pigeon Forge area, I still have family around there. Every time I'm in town for a visit, we have to go to Local Goat! I have always had great service and incredible food. On my most recent trip, our waiter was super friendly and personable. His name is Jeremy - huge shout out to him! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything is fresh and made from scratch in their kitchen.",5
The food was awesome! Tasted fresh and good portion sizes. Our server Santiago was amazing! Friendly and knowledgeable!,5
"Ribs cooked nicely. Wife had a fettuccine with chicken, also excellent. Generous portion sizes. Would definitely go back.",4
"Amazing experience on my first visit!  The deep fried deviled eggs were a great start, and the teriyaki kabobs were delicous and responsibly portioned.  Will definitely be back when I am in the area.",5
"Very tasty burger with fresh buns! The meat is really good.
The downside about the food is the french fries! They are really crispy, tiny and in some cases burnt!",5
"I enjoyed the Coconut Shrimp. Cooked to perfection! I also enjoyed a mimosa which was delightful. Everyone at our table was pleased with their meal and the service. We arrived at noon, on a Sunday, party of 5, seated immediately. Really enjoyed it! 10/10 definitely recommend!",5
"Meh,  it's over hyped.  The waitresses and waiters are for sure overworked. You will know for sure when you talk to them.. There isn't a day its not busy. This place is popular because it would remind you of a elks lodge or country club type feel in your hometown..  Overall it was good, but please be aware you are going to wait no matter what time of day or night you go.  Parties that are large will be asked to wait outside because there is no waiting area inside for large parties. It was me and my friend and we were asked to wait in our cars. The party of 10 in front of us was asked the same.   I'd go back to show friends, and let them make a decision from there. Portions are small but not really overpriced for the area. I had a chicken breast on rice with broccoli, and it was $12.00. That's typical for little Vegas in the mountains though.  I probably wouldn't go back myself.  I'd try to find something off the beaten path.  There are many in this area other than off a busy road like the Parkway.",3
"This place is so good!  Starts with the service where they tell you about the restaurant.  Everything is hand made and every burger is fantastic.  Didn't care for the Elvis burger (but that's a me thing and peanut butter).  I highly recommend the deep fried deviled eggs as a starter.  It's always packed, which is a good sign to me.  Gotta go !",5
"Food was excellent, we had a very nice server. Best part was the White chocolate bread pudding!!!",4
"Awesome experience. Fried deviled eggs were a treat. You could pull the bones right out of the ribs. The chocolate peanut butter pie was delicious.Tto top it off, our waiter provided awesome service and was a Braves fan :)",5
Great food and the atmosphere is wonderful. We sat at high top bar table near the bar. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. I had the fish and chips and my wife had a grilled chicken pasta dish that was amazing. I tried some and you could taste the different flavors.,5
"This place was amazing! Delicious, local sourced foods, my steak was perfectly done medium, onion ring sauce was interesting homemade and original, the bread pudding was a favorite for dessert",5
Very over rated place. Don't waste your time ordering the ribs. My whole group was very disappointed in their food. The waitress didn't offer to get the manager. But then we didn't ask for one either. We where just ready to go. I will not be gong back.,1
"I love the food, the cocktails and the great service I received from Alex and all the staff. We will definitely be back!",5
Most amazing food!  Handled our large group with no problem. It is an amazing place to eat.,5
"This was my second time to eat at Local Goat. The first time was wonderful and I decided to take my cousin who was visiting from Ohio.
First of all, a shout out to Jenny, our server!
She was great-professional and friendly.
We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes. Not a huge fan, normally, but these were dressed up with bacon jam and goat cheese. Delicious! I had the salmon and really enjoyed mashed potatoes. My cousin had Fettuccine Rocco. She couldn't eat the whole serving but said it was very good.",5
Top notch food and service. I give 5 stars just for the selection of beer and the ribs. Omg!!! The ribs... though I recommend you get a different side otherthan the fries,5
"Our food was outstanding and the service here is nothing short of exceptional. Daria was our server and she was very attentive, anwered our questions, and explained everything on the menu well.

The fried green tomatoes & fried deviled eggs were great, playing on texture as well as variety of savory, sweet & spicy flavors. The Hawaiian Ribye was cooked to medium perfection, I decided on fried rice as a side and used the whiskey glaze as a sauce. My husband had the smokehouse burger, also cooked to perfection juicy, and full of flavor. He had cheese grits as a side, they were just as good as Mama's.

The service! 1st of all this is the 5th time we've made an attempt to eat here this week. It's been PACKED every time and you can't even get in the parking lot. We decided to come at 10:15 and wait till they opened. There was already 2 folks ahead of us. We got in and were seated by 11:05. The whole restaurant was full by 11:15. As we sat back and watched the servers we were amazed at how smoothly they were operating. No one was frazzled. Everyone in the dining room seemed happy.

My only regret is that we live 12hrs away!",5
"Local Goat Restaurant has the best pastry chef's on the planet, hand crafted desserts from scratch every day.
There is always a line out the door at Local Goat, but their dessert menu is truly worth the wait.
The best place to go to celebrate a birthday or a Sunday family afternoon brunch",5
The food was great and the service was outstanding; Matthew (our server) was very attentive and polite. The burgers were delicious and cooked exactly to my specifications. I highly recommend this restaurant... you may have to wait to be seated but you won't be disappointed!!!,5
Best real food in Pigeon Forge. Best prices good atmosphere 99% in house made goods If you get Barbara as your waitress she will more than take care of you =),5
"Food was very good. Service seemed rushed. Between the 4 of us we had burgers, salad with seared tuna and nachos, all very good. We loved that the food was locally sourced. Mixed drinks were also delicious. We made a reservation so only waited a few minutes but we heard people being quoted over an hour wait.",4
"Made a lunch reservation for Local Goat a few days ago; it was a fantastic experience! Our reservation was honored within 20 minutes of arriving (we got there 10 early). The restaurant was clean, everyone was friendly, and our server, Tabbiana was phenomenal! We loved the deep fried deviled eggs and the mission of the restaurant. The steaks were perfect. We were in and out in about 30 minutes, a perfect lunch option for a busy day in Pigeon Forge!",5
"Great food, great atmosphere, great service. Our first visit to this area and Local Goat was highly recommended. We had a short wait but it was absolutely worth it. Our server, Brittany, was truly the best. Hope we can come back soon.",5
"Second time here. Just so delicious. Worth any wait time. The staff is upbeat and smart about the menu/food. Try the DEEP FRIED DEVILED EGGS!! You will be shocked how good they are. The pork chop was melt in your mouth perfect, salmon was so fresh and perfectly cooked. Steak salad was super tasty, love the dressing and husband's burger was HUGE and juicy. Four people shared their food and everyone was full and happy!
Try the DEEP FRIED DEVILED EGGS!",5
A great local place to get a bite to eat (though it'd be a really big bite). The burgers are incredible and the fries are also solid. Staff was great. Nothing to complain about.,5
I was at the bar only. Bartender was great. Good selection of beer and premium liquor. Loved the Bloody Mary with bacon salt!,5
Great food! Amazing people! Great atmosphere! Can't wait to go back!,5
"Out of all the places we got food while on our week long stay outside of Pigeon Forge this was our least favorite spot outside of some little hole in the wall BBQ place we stopped at our first night. The food was ok. Nothing special. The fries were cold and the burger was lackluster. My girlfriends pasta was better than the burger but still seemed like it was missing something.  The service, however was pretty good considering they were understaffed and our drinks were good.",3
"Great food....super busy, expect a wait but we'll worth it",5
The ribs fell off the bone. Very delicious. The creme brulee was excellent. Not too crazy about the blue cheese coleslaw though.,5
"Ate here for the first time and it was okay. The service was mediocre, wings were so so and for the kind of food that is served, a little over priced. They do have a wide variety on their menu, so one can surely find something they will like.",3
Good food. Nice place to eat. Friendly people,5
Awesome place to eat!,5
"The burger and fries was simply fantastic. Great atmosphere, the waiters were prompt and had an excellent memory, and the food was quick, hot, and better than most specialty burger places I've been to.

The guys with me had the same to say. We cleaned out plates and will be returning next trip!",5
W O W!!!  For 2 years I've wanted to try this place. Yesterday I finally got to try it. AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE! 10 OUT OF 10 IF IT WOULD LET ME. I had the Hawaiian ribeye. Holy sh@t!!! I eat steak 3 nights a week. Hands down one of the best I've had!,5
"This place wasn't terrible, but definitely *not* worth the one hour wait. Pretty comparable to your normal steak & burger restaurant.",3
Fried deviled eggs were good also I recommend the steak too ! The steak salad and the Maui chicken as well,5
"Great food, or waiter Devon done a excellent job. Menu had alot of options,even for the kids. Large beer selection.",5
Most flavorful steak in the area. Awesome food and service. Highly recommend.,5
"Last night of our vacation my family of seven, we were fortunate enough to choose the local goat for dinner.  Food was fantastic and we all had something different.  Steaks were cooked perfectly and great cuts.  Service and speed was perfect!  Thanks Jaydeen! Crab cakes were actually jumbo lump crab and not stuffing.  Only got pics of the dessert which were also great.  Everything made from scratch and you could tell.  Keep it up Local Goat, we will visit again next time we are in the area.",5
"The shrimp appetizer was great.
The burger was good.
Fries were cold.",5
"Party of 6, no previous knowledge of place, flipped a coin. All of were more than pleased with the experience. Lot was almost full, 6pm on a  Thursday. Told 30 minutes, seated in 20, only seen 2 other empty tables. Service was timely, friendly & knowledgeable.  Prices were $15-25. Very good for the quality & flavors. Food was excellent, table shared a lb of Cajun shrimp (good-fresh) & fried green tomatoes (excellent). Mains were fish & chips, chicken- veg pasta, tenderloins, mine was steak & crab-cake — best crab cake ever, even the salad was very good (no bitter greens). Everyone shared. We were mostly from FL & MI. Drinks were good not skimpy. No one had room for desert. We were new kitchen doors that sometimes is not good, but this time not bothersome and was part of our experience, seeing the various menu items go by.",5
Large portions and ABSOLUTELY THE BEST BABY BACK RIBS I'VE EVER ATE.  Falls right off the bone.  Very clean restaurant with excellent service.  Thank you!,5
"Our first time. The wait was quicker than expected for a 6:00 pm dinner. The waiter was fine. We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes for appetizer,  not fried in flour Thats for sure and very hard texture, not a very good taste. I ordered the fettechini Alfredo with chicken and again it was not what I expected, had a sweet tangy type of taste. My wife had a burger and fries and she said Fudruckers was better. Not trying to slam this business, just giving an honest review. Would we return???, We wouldn’t go out of our way.",3
Absolutely the best food not only in pigeon forge but anywhere I've been honestly. Really wish I could give it 10 stars! So good! I had the shrimp and grits my boyfriend got the Hawaiian ribeye and it was such a success!! Every time we come back we WILL eat here!,5
"This was our first time coming and this was a very nice restaurant.  Great food and drinks.  We had the kabobs and they were so tender and paired nicely with the broccoli and rice.  The bartender that night was on point!!  Kudos to the bartender and chef!

Restaurant was clean, service was fast, and bathrooms were clean.

Would definitely recommend.  Kid friendly as well!",5
"Made a reservation on Google, arrived way early and we were still seated very quickly. Service was AMAZING. So was the food. We got the fondue appetizer and had a variety of burgers and steaks at our table... It was all so good. I was surprised at how timely everything was considering how crowded they were. Would definitely recommend. Hope to try the deviled eggs next time.",5
I will have to say this is one of the best restaurants I have every been to. The hamburger was excellent if you took the cheese off but other than that I was good so I would recommend this place,5
"Great restaurant with an almost local feel, in the middle of a tourism hot spot.  No wonder the place was packed, with a 45 minute wait for a table, on a Tuesday night.  Great selection of beers, and burgers.  Kid friendly, too (subtle goat joke).   Bottom line, worth the wait for an unpretentious and escape from the themed eateries on the strip.",5
"The service was amazing. They didn't have crabcakes because the waiter inforned us there was a crab shortage; therefore, there werent any crabs available. The salmon was a nice portion but it lacked flavor. The broccoli was mushy and flavorless as well. The fried green tomatoes (not pictured) were sent back because there was hair in them. The chicken strips (not pictured) were good but a hair was also found in them. The fries were greasy and way too salty. I really wanted to like this place because of the idea of locally sourced ingredients and non GMO but the lack of flavor was such a turn off.",4
"Took roughly an hour to get our food. The wings were soggy and the fries were very salty. Also had a burger. It was ok, but the bun was way to thick. Was the only thing I ate that day and I was up sick all night. Take it for what it's worth, but I'll not be back.",2
Had great customer service food came out hot and accurate one of my favorite restaurants in the area,5
Very good selection of beers. Their mixed drinks are nothing to scoff at either.  That with the addition of a fantastic menu make this place a must stop on any vacation.,5
"Reservations online a must.  Great appetizers, great food, great service, excellent meal.  One of our favorites places to eat in PF.",5
"Phenomenal food, nice atmosphere, great service. We'll definitely be back if we return to Pigeon Forge.",5
"Nice food, friendly service, decent menu. One star lost due to smelly bathroom and dirty dishcloth smell at table, not sure whether this was from using a smelly mop on the floor or over-used cloth to wipe the table but a freshen up would help.",4
"The staff was very friendly.  They got my order wrong, but did correct it.  Atmosphere was ok but would have been much better without all the television sets hanging on the walls.",5
"Waited for an hour was told it would be 30 or 40 minutes. My little ones hotdog was weird tasting. Coconut shrimp was greasy. The shrimp and grits was gross! The grits were watery and it had some kind of brown glaze all over it like you put on fish, I couldn't even eat it. And I always love shrimp and grits. Lamb burger was good. Our waitress was very nice. But won't be going back for sure.",2
Our waiter (Jeff) was really good but that is about all that was...food took a very long time to come.  On arrival my husband had a cold baked potato.  He asked for it to be warmed and they brought a whole new one that was cold.  His steak had a good fkavor but was again cold.  My potato was cold as well as my burger.  Our granddaughters grilled cheese had unmelted cheese and no grill marks whatsoever.  The lava cake was also cold. Very expensive dinner and quite disappointing.,2
Beat food we have had in a long time great service too,5
"Long wait, but worth it,  so tasty. Prices were a little high,  but not so bad that i wouldn't go back again.  They do text when your table is ready, so you can go back and wait in your car.  Parking is tight and you may have to drive around a bit for s parking place.",5
Rating 2: Overly crowded with no signs of social distancing in this new pandemic era. It was hard to us to believe what we were seeing. Food was okay. Server Jessica was prompt and quick. We tried Patriot Burger and Mediterranean Salad. Burger was not tasty and salad was okay.,2
"Amazing food definitely worth the wait! Service was top notch we have ever had, Vladimir was super knowledgeable and very funny.",5
Food was outstanding! Server and staff were friendly! We each ate a burger. Portion size is very large. Cheese Fondue appetizer was also delicious! Appetizer came with free refills! Highly recommended!!!,5
"We needed somewhere to stop and eat after traveling and a lot of places were closing at 9 except Local Goat. Stopped in for a bite to eat and it was packed! It's always a good thing when a restaurant is full on a week night. We got seated right away and ordered. I liked that they had local beer menu to pick from, and their menu told their story about how they get ingredients locally hence the name. Giant TV/projection to watch football, and a separate bar area. The environment was laid back, servers wear jeans and a black top. But the food made it feel upscale. The food was super fresh and seasoned well. Everything was cooked perfectly. I wouldn't change a thing about the food we ate that night. Definitely will be back again, this will be a new go to for sure. Compliments to the chef!",5
"I went back in November and it was some of the best restaurant food I've ever had they make everything in house and the service was excellent. We started with the spinach artichoke dip which was divine.

After which I ordered a steak which was seasoned very welland cooked perfectly medium rare.
My fiance ordered tuna which according to her was the best tuna she had ever had.
We will be back next time we are in Gatlinburg/Pigeon forge",5
"Amazing!! This place was one of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to. So much more then just an average ""New American Restaurant"". The restaurant quality is superb. Most of what they use is local ingredients. Local meats, local herbs and veggies, local spices, fresh baked breads every day.....the list goes on. When you get there, and there's a long wait, ITS WORTH IT! Try this place once at least. You'll certainly be back.

It's not even outrageously priced. Very average prices, yet amazing food. So fresh and authentic.",5
This restaurant has a 30 to 45 minute wait it is definitely worth the wait. This was my third time there and every time the food was delicious. My daughters steak was little undercooked they immediately took it back and brought her out another steak and it was wonderful. You won’t be disappointed I love the fries and the lava cake,4
Would have been 5 star but once we got up to leave I realized they sat us in a booth with brown chocolate or sauce in it and ruined a hundred dollar pair of jeans. Just look before you sit.,1
Excellent food!  The deviled eggs are amazing !!!  The crab cakes are delicious!  Gray place for dinner!!!,4
"Surprised to be disappointed! After high hopes, the food just wasn't as good as we expected. The chicken wings were a good size (10 for $12 so they shouldn't be small) but the sauce was one-step-up from tasteless and not crispy. We have ordered mild wings for decades, but we have never had mild sauce so very mild. The blue cheese dressing had a good taste, but it was very thin. It didn't stick, it dripped off. Maybe it's ok for salads, but not for dipping. The carmelized onion mashed potatoes were good mashed potatoes (they should be- sides are not cheap) but I didn't see or taste any caramelized onions whatsoever. When I asked, thinking maybe the cooks were supposed to put them on top and they forgot, I was told that, ""They're in there. They're chopped up small, but they are in there."" I would rather see them and taste them. The fries were good, but at $5 for a side of fries, we expected good fries. When we arrived and read the menu, we were already planning our next trip back. I don't think we will go back. The decor leans heavily on black, server was nice, concept of local and homemade is good too, but a $39 lunch for two should be awesome. It was not.",2
Steak nachos are delicious. I would also like the baby back ribs.,5
"First experience here was great. Great staff, delicious food. I would highly recommend for you to try it out for yourself. Try the jello shots! Yum!",5
Worth the wait every time. This place has the most amazing burgers on the planet. And their jalapeno ranch with their onion rings are epic. Everything is made in house from scratch and all their meats and vegetables are locally sourced. The staff is professional and curtious. They can explain each menu item in detail. The outside of the local goat does not look like a fancy establishment bit once you get inside you will be amazed by how awesome it is. 10 out or 10 for sure. You simply must try The Local Goat.,5
"Very good. Had the fried green tomatoes, the Milton, and the Elvis. Generous portions. Ben was our server. He is as friendly as he is tall. This was our first dinner this vacation and we plan to be back before we leave this week!",5
"The food was the best we had the whole trip. Hands down. We had the deep-fried deviled eggs and we loved them. The burgers were great - from the fresh-baked buns to the delicious beef. The beer selection was top-notch and the prices were really reasonable for the service and ambiance. I was ready to sit down and write a five-star review. Until I checked my credit card statement. I know it's going to seem petty but I was very disappointed to see that my card was charged 64 cents more than I had written on the credit card receipt. The bill was $xx.64 and I clearly wrote a whole dollar amount that included an 18%+ tip. But when I checked my statement I found that the charge was that whole dollar amount plus the 64 cents. Not really a big deal - but annoying none-the-less. We will return, but the tip will be in cash. Maybe next time I can give the whole five-stars.",4
"Awesome atmosphere. Delicious food. Service was fast (Elijah was our server).... You're missing out if you don't give this place a try... I Promise, you won't regret your decision.... eat @localgoat",5
"Seriously the best all around restaurant I've ever eaten at! The service was phenomenal, the menu was amazing and the fact that it's real, high quality, healthy food makes it even better! I don't even leave reviews typically, but the experience was so good, they deserve it! It was priced so well too! No more expensive than a typical chain sit down restaurant! Definitely going to have to come back!!",5
This place is amazing! We have made it a rule that soon as we get to town to make this the first stop to eat and grab drinks. Great staff and food. Can't go wrong with this place it never disappoints!,5
"99% of their food is made in-house. If that doesn't tell you how good this place is then nothing I say will. They take reservations so make sure and take advantage of that. There is typically always a wait if you walk up. However, don't let that deter you. It is worth whatever wait they have.

This is not only one of the best restaurants in Pigeon Forge, but that I have ever been to anywhere. Honestly, the food is way underpriced for the quality and quantity. If you like wings make sure and try those. If you like soup make sure and try their bisque. It is the best soup I've ever had.

Have you made your reservation yet? No? Shame on you. Now you have? *Air high five* (I would give a normal high five, but you know....COVID.)",5
"Our entire group really loved this place! The deep fried deviled eggs and the ahi tuna “burger” (The Milton) and the bread pudding were among the favorites. It was so good we made it a point to make a second stop here during our trip. They seem to always be packed, so plan accordingly…but they are definitely worth the wait!! We will definitely be coming back if we are in town in the future. The bread pudding is the biggest serving I’ve ever seen in a restaurant…definitely enough for 3+ people!",5
"Food100%, waitress 100% , prices were high , but so worth it, very good customer service!! I'll Def go back when in Pigeon Forge again!",5
"The service was spectacular, and the food was excellent! We'll definitely be back for a visit next time we're in town.",5
Some awesome unique burgers!  Fried green tomatoes with bacon jam is life.,4
"Pricey, and busy, but worth every penny and every minute!",5
"This place was really good, not much for vegan's but did have options. The service was friendly and fast, the place was packed and we were there late lunch... which says a lot. Would eat here again",5
"Great place to eat. The atmosphere was good, the service was awesome. The food was delicious.",4
"Great service, great location. The food was a amazing as well. Went with a group they were very accommodating. We tried several of their dishes. The friend green tomatoes was delicious.",5
"First time eating here, I ordered the bbq chicken sandwich and it was great! High quality food. Will be back again!",5
"This was a last minute find to get some much needed food after Dollywood. and this place was a 10/10. Esp since i’m vegetarian there was options for me to eat as well ! Our wait wasn’t long, our waitress was so nice and sweet and went over our questions we had! A wonderful place to come on vacation. :) wish we had a place like this back at home !!",5
"What a great find! The Local Goat is conveniently on the Parkway and specializes in locally sourced food. The burgers are delicious, but the Cheese Fondue was our favorite!",5
"Food was great, staff super friendly. Best come hungry cuz they give you a lot! Hamburger were hugh. Ton of fries too!",5
"We stopped here because of the name. Was anticipating lots of goat options, that was not the case, and was a bit disappointing.
The food was enjoyable, although because it was later in the evening, they were out of a few menu items.
Was the first restaurant I've been to that charges you to sample the beers before you order one.
Service was good and friendly.",4
Great service! Great good! The fries are the best I've had! They taste like a fried baked potato! And the cheese fondue is a must!!,5
Great menu! Fast service. The food was incredible. Would definitely go back again.,5
"Best food in Pigeon Forge, make reservations. Great food, great service... really really worth the stop!",5
"The local goat is worth visiting for casual dining. Food was good, service was good and the cocktails were delicious. I would choose the local goat over a chain restaurant any day. You'll find all your typical menu items for the area, and the portions were large.

( I commonly eat meals prepared by a CE Chef so it did not ""wow"" me, but I left feeling content which is a difficult task.)",4
Food was good. Waiter gave recommendations and we enjoyed it. Reasonably priced for lunch.,5
We had reservations at 5:30 and got there early because we aren’t from here. We checked in early and sat at the bar for a drink. We got to our table early. Vodka lemonade was delicious. Husband says bourbon selection is fairly decent. He had the ribs and said they were good but a little dry. I have the fettuccini Rocco which was absolutely delicious. The service was really nice also. The bar and our table service. Would recommend but definitely get reservations.,5
Great food. Please order a full rack of fall off the bone ribs. I would definitely recommend. Go earlier to beat the crowd.,5
Nice beer list but the food menu was lack luster. Not worth the wait,3
"Good service, decent food...I wasn't a fan of the fried green tomatoes.",4
"Food and service is excellent. Deviled eggs, burgers, and salads are delicious. Full bar with hand crafted cocktails and mixers.",5
"Great beef ground onsite  for burgers, buns made onsite also. Onion rings are the size of donuts. Salad dressings are housemade and very good.  They have a wide variety of burgers and dinner options. Definitely use the website to make reservations. Wait times can be long and parking can problematic. Service was excellent.",5
"Really enjoyed the fried deviled eggs and the shrimp and grits. But the ahi tuna on the Milton sandwich tasted fishy, though.",3
"The service was great! Our server Jacob was very attentive and made sure we were good the whole time. The food was good, I dont know if it necessarily lived up to the hype other reviewers left, but it was well worth the try. Really love that they use so much local product!",4
Absolutely phenomenal. We had an hour wait on a Saturday night but I would have waited five hours!! Exceptionally good food!!!!!,5
"My roommate and I visited the Local Goat in March and still haven't stopped talking about it. Local Goat has the absolute best burger I've ever eaten in my life. I didn't even know burgers could be this good!! I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to everyone I know. All the food is local and farm fresh- they even make their own ketchup! We've considered taking a day trip from Lexington, KY to Pigeon Forge just eat here again!!",5
"We got right in at around 3pm, we had an Awesome waiter Vladimir who was so wonderful helping us decide for our 1st time going there and the food definitely lived up to all the hype! Must try when in the mountains!",5
"Ribs were meaty and very good, service was fast and friendly. Ribs and Salmon came out hot and properly cooked.  Mashed potatoes were good as well. The shoestring french fries were barely edible because of the grease,size of the cuts and being all stuck together. Lava cake was clearly frozen and when heated, I assume in a microwave, it became rubbery. I won't make it a point to go there again but if I'm a group setting I wouldn't put right refuse.",4
Food was OK. Not bad just okay. My daughters salmon tasted like it had just been defrosted. The overwhelming flavor of the salmon was water. One member of our party was gluten free server was very dismissive about it we asked someone else and they explained what the restaurant does to.avoid cross contamination. For the price so many better options.,3
"With the blonde rude woman at the door and  the weird fried green tomatoes, I wasn’t impressed with my meal at all. With the booth we had, it was best that I didn’t eat a lot cause if I did there wasn’t enough room to grow. It was just over a foot from the back of the seat to the table. It wasn’t very comfortable at all. The salt shaker was all wet inside as well. There are better places to eat. We won’t be back",1
"Might have just caught them on an off night but thought the food was average at best.  The fried items we tried like the deviled eggs and the French fries were very greasy almost like their oil was not hot enough when cooking.

The burgers were excellent, fish n chips did not taste fresh.  Drinks also took a very long time to come out.  We got our appetizers before drinks.

Thankfully we had a reservation because I would have been disappointed if we waited a long while for the meal we had.

I’d be willing to try this restaurant again, hope for a better experience.",3
"Excellent! Food was amazing, craft beer selection was great, and kids meals were reasonably priced and good food.",5
"Loved it!  The name does not reflect the selection.   Good service and great selection of entrees.   The fried green tomatoes, bar B Q chicken nachos and the kids loved their fries..",4
Everything locally sourced. Super large servings. A bit of a wait but the meal was worth it.,5
Good quality food and good service just be prepared to wait to get in because this place is very popular which is a good thing.,5
"Had an awesome lamb burger with a whiskey Martini (I'm calling it my Lamburgh-ini combo). food was top notch. Some of the denizens (not the staff) were a little aromatic and off putting, but everything else was top notch. Waiter's attention was a little difficult to get, but they were busy so I get it.  All in all, I'm coming back and I'm bringing my lunch cooler with.",4
"Once AGAIN, just Wonderful Service, this time we had Sara Jane. We were here the 1st time last September celebrating my hubbs 70th Birthday. This time was an early 6yr Wedding Anniversary. Thank u for being u Sara Jane. And Thank You Local Goat.. And I will find that song u recommended. We will Return.

This was 7/25/20.❤ fried deviled eggs are THEE most amazing thing. Lol and the rest of tge food was Great too. ❤❤ See u next yr.",5
Great food very pleasant help food hot n plentiful. Nice atmosphere suggest making reservations,5
"DELICIOUS.
The onion rings were on the difficult side just due to their size, the onions didn't cut as easily but still tasty with the jalapeño ranch dipping sauce. I got the teriyaki for my entree, the broccoli - little disappointing, overcooked and lacked flavor but once I added salt & copious amounts of black pepper it was better.
My husband's steak and baked potato were fantastic and cooked just the way he likes ! For someone who never not uses condiments he said the steak was so good it didn't need sauce - shocked for sure !!!

*little tip* Long wait but worth it - if you can, reserve a table through the Google app ! 😉",4
"Absolutely delicious!! Stumbled upon this when a lot of other restaurants were closed for the season. Would have gone every night if we found it sooner. Wings, spinach artichoke dip, pimento cheese burger, fresh cut fries and the amazing white chocolate bread pudding...yep I ate way too much but 100% worth it.",5
Great vegetarian options! Reasonably priced kids menu and great service. Has a fine-dining feel that's also family friendly.,5
Server  was  100♡\☆ we had  12 people  that was eating  .and she did awesome. 6 adults and 6 children that were eating. And a 4mo old .I didn't  get her name though. She even helped us to even find shirts  sizes..Witch you'll didn't have no sizes that we needed..But I'll come back and check for them. Loved the food .thank you,3
Finally got to go! I had the shrimp and grits my husband had the fish and chips the food was awesome! The server was George he was a lot of fun!,5
"Great food, clean, fast, friendly service. Well staffed, good variety of food for all eaters. Bonus, our waiter was a Chris Pratt look alike!",5
Deep fried deviled eggs and fried green tomatoe appetizers are awesome.,5
"I am a vegan, it was hard to find vegan food in smoky mountains area. When I found this restaurant my expectations were high and after dine in I could not stop giving 5.
Taste food
Clean seating
Friendly and helpful service
Clean restroom.

Y’ll vegans out there try there “The Schrute Burger”. It’s tempting and grate taste.

Can’t wait to go back.",5
"Outstanding IMO. Steak was great, fries are out of this world! Beer options were extensive and not too expensive. Service was great. I def recommend the fries as well as the chocolate lava cake, lol. Yummmm.",5
We had an amazing experience here! The food was delicious and worth the wait! Great cocktails and friendly server as well!,5
"We went here as a party of 4 while in town. The wings are absolutely amazing, and growing up in the north east I know a good chicken wing. My FIL had the crab cake and he said it was a little bland, but the burger my husband and MIL got were both good. Again though - the wings are were it’s at! The atmosphere is also really cool. Definitely a place to check out.",4
"Best place to eat in The Smoky Mountains, hands down!

We were so tired of overpriced chicken and dumplings, mashed potatoes and fried chicken while we were on our trip to the mountains. We desperately searched for something else.

This place offers so much more and was DELICIOUS!! Absolutely zero complaints. Even the ketchup was delicious. I truly wish they sold it. I can’t wait to visit again!",5
"This was our first time going and I have to say it's my new favorite restaurant in the area. The food was out of this world, the service was outstanding, and every staff member was very friendly and accommodating. There was a long wait but it was totally worth it! We will be going back many times in the future.",5
"Excellent American food, using local ingredients! I had the pimento cheese burger and it did not disappoint. The staff was super kind and attentive. After you finish eating, check out their soaps and lotions. Definitely going back.",5
Great service and delicious food,5
Nice atmosphere. The food is delicious. The ribs were so tender and meaty.,5
The BEST meal we had on our Honeymoon! We will definitely be back every year.,5
"Well it's a greasy spoon.  Took 12 minutes for waiter to stop by.  Staff were pleasant but definitely NOT over attentive.

Very clean and well kept.

If burgers and fries are your thing then this could work. Over all we were not impressed with food and service.",3
"Local recommended, and they were spot on. This was a great experience.",5
Great food and drinks. Fast service,5
Delicious. Will return. Grab a reservation online 2 or 3 days in advance to safe trouble. Glad I thought about it.,5
Excellent place to eat! You're gonna want to call and make a reservation no matter what time you plan to go. I went at 2pm on a Thursday having made a reservation the day before and they were still super busy. Finding a parking spot on a Friday or Saturday is a gamble. Fantastic food and well worth the appointment!,5
Very tasty burgers!  Something different from what you’d expect.  Truly Locally sourced as the name suggests.  Prices were decent. Wait to be seated was a bit long…go early,4
Great food and drink menu. Staff is incredibly nice and knowledgeable of the menu. The fried deviled eggs and amazing.,5
"The best ribs I have ever had.
Very good food and service.",5
This is a great restaurant that always delivers great food!! Only downside is it's usually so packed you'll have to wait. Highly recommend.,5
Awesome food and service. Pimento cheese burger is off the chain.,5
"I was looking forward to trying this place for lunch today but when we walked in the lobby smelled very strongly of urine. I told the male host and he just nodded at me but didn't say anything. We got seated just in case it was a temporary issue just in the lobby, though of course smelling urine when you walk into a restaurant gives you doubts right away. When we were seated by the female host it still smelled so we told her and she apologized and said it was the carpet and they were getting it replaced very soon. She moved us to another table in hopes that the smell would be better,  but it wasn't.  We ended up leaving because of the smell. The place was pretty busy, I have no idea how the other people didn't notice or care about an overwhelming urine smell while they ate.",1
Reminds me of Darfons in Nashville. Just really good food. Great service too. A must place to go in Pigeon Forge,5
One our favorite places to eat in Pigeon Forge. Excellent food and service with a decent selection of beer too boot. Only downside... has become *extremely* popular and can be hard to get into easily. Well worth the wait if not too long.,5
Gotta get the deep fried deviled eggs,5
No complaints with the 5 meals ordered. All tasted delicious!,5
Omg no wonder this place is always packed!! Great food and service don't regret my 150 dollar food bill for 6 people !,5
"Oooh wow.. talk about deliciousness, freshness and affordable prices... my first time and I will definitely be back. The food is great.. my waitress oh lord I missed the name but girl you got your tip that's what matters.. they ggot their own chef.. everything created from scratch.. that's good right there..",5
We arrived actually 30 minutes till closing in admittedly poor form but the staff was nothing but friendly and accommodating none the less. The waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and made several menu recommendations that party members ordered and were all fantastic. Those were the pork chop and the Kentucky bourbon burger both were delicious. They stated 99% of the items are made fresh daily and it shows. The bar menu is also quite comprehensive.,5
"Really good! We searched far and wide for place and finally asked a local and this was recommended.

- Salmon is really good (flown in fresh every day)
- shoestring fries, always good!
- the burgers were super good! Pro tip: get a side of the TN whiskey sauce, it’s incredible.
- the sautéed onion mashed potatoes were out of this world! I didn’t know mashed potatoes could be that good!

Worth trying, if you are disappointed you probably have too high of expectations for a restaurant in a tourist town.",5
"We stayed around the corner for vacation
Ater noticing the parking lot ALWAYS full, we decided to try it out. First time, no wait at all. Party of four all got something different and was amazing! The very next day we went back and changed it up just a little with customizations and was yet again, thrilled! Tastedbuds and stomachs were very pleased!

This place will be a go-to, whenever we're in pigeon forge/gatlinburg!",5
The food was amazing. So glad we stopped to try it . looked like a different kind of cool place. Very very good food and service.,5
Delicious. Service was great. We had a reservation for 6:45 and were seated promptly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the parking. It was a nightmare and dangerous. They definitely need to buy the land next door to increase spots for the amount of seating.,4
"Server was great, food was awful. Steaks under done and tough. Bread pudding was so dense....ugh.",2
"BEST SHRIMP AND GRITS EVER. LARGE PORTIONS.  EVERYTHING WAS EXCELLENT,  FROM SERVICE,  LOCATION AND ESPECIALLY THE FOOD. WISH I HAD TAKEN PICTURES.",5
Very disappointed. After all  the hype we heard about it. Not enough variety on the menu. Food was so so. Service was good.,3
"The food is farm to table including the meats. They have a nice variety including fried develed eggs which were yummy 😋. We had Steve who was great. My friends said if we had eaten there the first day in town, that we probably would have eaten all our meals there. It was fabulous!",5
Had the fried devil eggs. My party and I never heard or had them. They were excellent!!,5
Friendly environment. Food was delicious. All staff wear mask. Would definitely come again!!,5
"Great atmosphere and incredible food. Jessica was AWESOME, made sure we wanted for nothing.",5
Great food!,5
Very good!!!  We had a short wait but it was worth it! We loved this place! The bread pudding was AMAZING!!!! Make sure you save room for it!!,5
"My wife and I went to the Local Goat on our 3rd Anniversary while on vacation. Our waiter, Ryan, provided excellent service as well as recommendations while navigating their delicious menu. Chef owned, farm to table, ketchup made in house, kitchen opens at 8 so they can smoke their ribs and make their sandwich buns from scratch. This one hit all of the right notes. I do think the fries could be improved and cole slaw was ‘okay’. 4.7 if google didn’t force the rookie scores, but I have to give you kudos for being on point. Thank you Local Goat. Thank you.",5
"Diner @ Local Goat was so great.  If you are number 1 on every review list and there is a line to eat you doing something right.  I  had a fancy drink - Buckberry  Fashion'd their very good play on an Old Fashion and a Pimento and Cheese Bacon Jam Grilled Onion Burger with cheese grits and it was amazing.
Five stars from all 4 of us.  We all had  a different burger and they were all great.",5
Best burger I have ever had.. New favorite restaurant.. Awesome service ad well!,5
"Ohhhhh my goodness, I read a ton of reviews about the Local Goat and everyone was right... this is a must stop and enjoy place to eat. From what I've heard, I believe that 99% of the food is local and made in house. The ribs literally fell off the bones, so juicy and tender and full of flavor too.",5
"Outrageously great service, amazing food at an outstandingly good price.",5
Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with suggestions since it was our first visit. He was very attentive throughout our entire meal too. Everything made from scratch and fresh local vendors.,5
Great food and great service. We have been several times over the last couple years and went twice in the week we just stayed on vacation. Would highly recommend the place.,5
"Well,this place would of got 5 stars but....we got to the restaurant about 3:30 on Monday 7/26/2021.we got checked in with a 45 minute wait,no biggie Cause we went an sat at the bar anyway.got are menus, an then there we were 5 minutes later trying to get are bartenders attention to order a couple of drinks,then another 15 trying to get a couple of apps. Trying to get a refill on water wasn't happening, and you would think it would be easy to get good service at the bar,especially when there was less then 12 seats to wait on and 5 bartenders, it was not packed at all.local goat??? But not were locals would go! start looking for better bartenders, the owner's should really be aware of the amount of money they are losing from bar revenue due to bad bartenders, an customer service from them.food was good,wings were dry.place was clean!. And also the blonde hostess at the front with pink highlights in her hair was amazingly rude!. And no to go food???... come on .",2
"The food and atmosphere is wonderful. We got an Ahi Tuna appetizer, coconut shrimp entree and chocolate lava cake for dessert. So good!!",5
"Really amazing food! 10/10 recommend! Service was okay, but the overall experience was very nice. Their food is freshly made everyday and hand cut meat by the chef. It’s also all local! Honestly so happy we decided to wait it was well worth it!",5
"Food was AMAZING, service was impeccable. Most of all ll the food is locally grown and sourced. There isn't enough adjectives to describe how much my family and I love this place. Everyone ordered something different and then ended up sharing with each other, because we each wanted the other person to try the other's food, because of how good it was.",5
"This place is by far my favorite restaurant we’ve stumbled upon! The atmosphere is relaxing and really nice. And everything they have is locally bought, grown or made! If you like honey mustard, try theirs that is homemade! It’s to die for!",5
Our waiter was amazing he was fast polite and very funny. If I remember right his name was Jeremy. The food was delicious and there was no long wait. We were on vacation and before leaving made sure to stop by again.,5
"Of all the places we have eaten on our vacation in Pigeon Forge, this has been the best. I definitely recommend! Food is crazy good and our server was attentive and friendly.",5
Excellent meal. HUGE onion rings were delicious.,5
"Amazing food, locally sourced, great service ... Will definitely go back!!",5
"Great food and service! It was our first visit and we loved it. The menu selection was awesome. I highly recommend eating here, you won't be disappointed.",5
"Party of 2, sat down for 20 minutes and servers just kept staring at us…we just got up and left when they sat down 2 big parties behind us next to the bar after we were waiting for 20 minutes and proceeded to take both their orders. I guess it didn’t help that we were the only POC there in the entire restaurant besides the bus boy…management check the time stamp for 8/14/21 at 3:53pm…I’m sure you don’t care though, all good though",1
Food wasnt near the hype of what everyone said it was highly overrated and also overpriced i do believe but i am gonna go back again sometime another and i will give them a second chance to see if they really got it and possibly just me or maybe because we dined in to late in the evening or something im not sure but i believe everything atleast deserves to be atleast givin another chance so we shall see.,3
"I enjoyed the Local Goat. The hamburgers are really big and there are many choices. The patties are homemade and good. The fries are good also.  There is a nice selection of beers on tap. There is a sports bar area in the back of the restaurant which is good, you can watch games or sports news. The fish and chips is also good. It is real battered cod and tasty. You can get goat cheese with just about anything you order. The cheese is good, if you like goat cheese. This restaurant opened in 2016. We did not have to wait because we decided to sit in the bar area. I have been told that during tourist season this place gets super busy and there can be long waits. I would recommend you make a reservation during the season or at least get on a waiting list, by using your phone in Google maps or calling ahead.",5
"Delicious! From the homemade lemonade and salad dressings to the perfectly cooked steak and melt in your mouth desserts this dinner was the highlight of our day. My personal favorite is the Ahi Tuna appetizer but my family enjoyed the deviled eggs and cheese fondue as well. Reservations were quick and easy, LOVE that they confirmed back! Janice our server was friendly, fast and checked on us at appropriate intervals. So glad we celebrated our 20th Anniversary and our son's first day of college with the Local Goat. Memories were made 😀",5
"An Excellent surprise, this local food sourced restaurant iN Pigeon Forge is a must check out. They have delicious well prepared food, micro brews and Goats Milk hand creams. Two Thumbs up.",5
Great place to eat.,5
"Incredible shrimp appetizer, my wife and shared the pimento cheese burger which was also very good. Great atmosphere and friendly service.",5
I liked their semi progressive menu  For my entree I chose the the Shrimp and Grits  this style was not a Grit Cake grilled or pan fried  but a mush style with the shrimp and low flavor sauce poured over. The menu did not say Grit Cake in their defense plus the absence of any andouille or tasso was disappointing .,2
"Excellent food and service. Wait time was a bit long, but we learned that they do take reservations. Will definitely visit again when we come back to the Smokey Mountains.",5
Delicious burgers. All dressings and sauces are homemade. While the bacon jam is delicious it overpowered my pimento cheeseburger next time I will order without. Burgers are around $10 and they come fries!! There's even a portobello mushroom option. Will definitely be back.,5
"Great service and amazing food & cocktails. Most everything is scratch made and locally sourced when possible. Some of our family's favorites were the cheese fondue, coconut shrimp, garden salad, fettuccine Rocco, and the sirloin. They were out of a few things we asked for, but it was late Sunday after a busy weekend. Only thing we didn't like was the bread pudding. This was my second time here and I'll definitely be back any time we are in Pigeon Forge.",5
Great place! Parking definitely an issue.,5
Great food and excellent service but bathrooms are unsanitary from what I seen.,4
"The absolute best place to eat, be sure and get a reservation because they are busy. We enjoyed the deep fried deviled eggs and green fried tomatoes to start with, they were the bomb!!! Then we enjoyed steak and ribs, the ribs were so meaty and fell off the bone",5
"Well they typed in the wrong phone number to alert us our table was ready, mind you we are 3 feet away and no one bothers to ask if we are waiting, so we wait an extra 20 minutes to get a table.   Then our waitress service was about as poor as possible.  The food was good but not spectacular. The manager did comp one meal for the trouble which was appreciated, but I had hoped for a better experience.  I think a meal at any chain restaurant would have been as good.  Disappointed",2
"Beyond my expectations..
Excellent Service and Food will
definitely go back to and Highly recommend.",5
"Fun local restaurant with a full menu.  We had fondue, deep fried deviled eggs, and a lamb burger.

We were recommended to eat here by Buford from redneck Comedy Bus tours.  He told us to try the fried deviled eggs.  They were pretty good!

We really enjoyed the fondue!  I think this place is worth a visit.",4
Deviled eggs were awesome! A must have.,4
The food was amazing and our service was excellent. Our waiter made suggestions on foods to eat and was super friendly. Will definitely go back if we are in the area.,5
Truly enjoyed a great late lunch here. Menu was fairly extensive. They also had a nice list of craft beers. My waitress was terrific & she was very well informed about what they served. Service was prompt and prices were moderate. I would go back.,4
"I always get great food and service here.  Mckenzie was our server today.  She was super friendly and we never needed to ask for anything, because she was anticipating what we needed and already getting it for us.",5
Great food and tasty drinks.,5
"I highly recommend the Local Goat restaurant. Our food was great. We had the deep fried deviled eggs, burgers, and tavern chicken sandwich. All were well seasoned and beautifully presented. Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and professional. It stays busy, so I recommend getting on the wait list early or making a reservation.",5
"Expect a wait and plan accordingly. But your planning will pay off. A well organized staff, fantastic selection of quality food and drink, and a great atmosphere. One of my best recent experiences in Pigeon Forge.",5
Awesome place. Food is outstanding! Highly recommended.,5
"Seriously the best burger I have ever had, hands down!! My husband and I also got the deviled eggs and they were absolutely delicious!! It’s an amazing atmosphere, the service is phenomenal ask for Rusty! They will probably be PACKED when you come but you won’t wait long, I promise, and even if you do it’s so well worth it!!",5
"My family loved the food and atmosphere. The burgers and cocktails were excellent, as was the roasted pepper appetizer.  We enjoyed everything so much that we went back before leaving the area.",5
"Some of the best food I’ve had in a long time!  Huge tasty specialty burgers, hand cut fries, shrimp and grits and lots of other things.",5
The food was AMAZING! Olga was very helpful and knowledgeable.  Everything we tried was so good. Nice atmosphere. Can't wait to go back.,5
Cant even say enough about this food. It was great and we cant wait to.xome back. Make sure to try the fried Deviled Eggs they are amazing even though they sound weird.,5
"Nice service and atmosphere. Even better food. Highly recommend the Tennessee Whiskey Glazed burger with garlic aioli, smoked bacon, and fried onions. Complex flavor mix, with just the right balance of savory and sweet. I'll be back here again to try the others.",5
"I have to say that after a hike, dinner at the Local Goat is a must have. They have a fantastic selection of both local and national beers, and a variety of other drinks. The food was incredibly tasty, and almost all of it was locally sourced and prepared in house.

Incredible wait staff and the server was very knowledgeable. You can expect a little bit of a wait, but it is very worth it.",5
"Made a reservation for today at 4pm. Glitched it to Saturday apparently this happens all the time, no apology whatsoever, put us on the 45 min waitlist and still waiting.  Awesome, save the drive, can’t imagine it’s worth it. Person working the counter looks like she hasn’t cracked a smile since 1994.",1
"I have been to Local Goat multiple times when visiting the area. The food has never disappointed me. They have a great selection of dishes on their menu for about everyone. Their drinks and house craft beer on tap from the bar are great. The food is top quality and the kitchen consistently prepares food grilled to perfection. The weekend grill crew are grilling masters and just observing other tables I could see that awesome quality was comming out of kitchen. The service is friendly and some of the servers are absolutely fantastic at their jobs.

I originally found Local Goat on the last day of my trip a few years ago. I've brought family to Local Goat on return trips and we liked it so much we stopped back multiple times for meals.",5
"Husband and I went there last night. We both got a hamburger, and both had gotten bad heartburn/indigestion/nausea. Everything (including ketchup) had some kind of seasoning, not sure what they use but thinking it had something to do with feeling sick afterwards. Service was great",3
Seated quickly and served a delicious meal even faster! Definitely recommend!,5
Excellent burgers! The nachos were fantastic as well! They prepare everything from scratch...including condiments. We will definitely return next time we are visiting!,5
Had the steak nachos and the cheese fondue. Everything was good.,4
"Went to dinner here while on my honeymoon! The staff was awesome, shout out to our waiter Jeff! They all worked like a well oiled machine! The food was incredible and they had a very comfortable atmosphere! I highly recommend! I will be here again!",5
"Reservation recommended. Great selection of beers. Food was good; burgers are impossible to hold/bite, but that's what a fork and knife are for. Some of the best fries I've had, and their in-house ketchup was great.",5
"We are on vacation, and chose this option. The food is reasonably priced for a vacation city, and it was all delicious! We all ended up sharing our meals because all of it was so good. Ribs were super tender and well seasoned. Shrimp and grits were great with a kick of spice. Crab cake burger was also very good! The only one who didn't share was our son who ate every last bite of his HUGE bacon cheeseburger.",5
"Food and service were great! Steak nachos are a must, they were amazing. Fish and chips is also highly recommended. Love that they make everything in house. Definitely will be back!",5
"Although the wait was very long. Our server Rachel was great and everyone was very friendly. The steak was cooked exactly right, the baked potato and salad were great. We had the fried green tomatoes and they were oh so good.",5
"Service on point food great and locally sourced, worth the wait, will return forsure",5
"First time there. It came highly recommended. Had the fried deviled eggs. They were good. Daughter had chicken strips, soon has tuna burger, I had burger with an egg, rid had the chicken sandwich. All wasb good. Beth was our server, she was very prompt and courteous. Kept the drinks full. Bathrooms were clean. Overall enjoyed the experience and would go back. Note...make reservations a couple days ahead of time.it gets crazy busy",5
"Great food, even better service!!  Highly recommended.",5
"Let me tell you about a kind hearted server that deserves a raise!
David R. is a one of a kind server!

Our 16 month old was feeling rather hangry when we got seated.

The first thing he did was give her a plate of fruit, which she loved! He then made silly faces and made her smile every time he came by the table!

He even gave her a cute present at the end of the meal!

Oh and did I mention refilling drinks before my current one was even empty!

Like I said, he definitely deserves a raise, or a promotion!

Will come back here again when in town and request him for sure!",5
"Our server was on point. Haven't seen service like this in a long time. They served on the right side which is proper. Never had to wait on drinks, and he was entertaining as well.

The food was great and came out fairly quickly. There was only one thing we didn't care for so much but considering the rest of the experience, it can be overlooked.",5
"If I could give this place a 10,  I would! It was that good! Fresh food and drinks with great service! Top Quality Food! Must try the deep fried deviled eggs for something different and delicious!",5
This place is the best! Amazing service and outstanding food and cocktails!,5
"Two friends and I went here, and it's literally the only restaurant I have ever been to that I can happily give a five-star review. My friends and I are in the car now raving about how much we love Local Goat. We all decided we wanted to come back after the first bite of the appetizer! EVERYTHING was fantastic, including the staff. The server was pleasant, nice, and friendly. I definitely recommend the créme brúlee. I didn't want to finish the meal because I didn't want to stop eating it.",5
"Heard about this place from a friend, and gave it a try. All their food is prepared in house from scratch, right down to the bread for the hamburgers. Also their craft beer menu is amazing. I'd definetly give this place a try!",4
Always the very best. I love bringing out of town guests to LG. They love it!,5
"The food was delicious and as fast.
Yummy",5
The food was amazing and came out quickly! The hype is real!! Get the bbq chicken nachos!,5
Great food! And Casey did a great job as our server!,5
This was my first visit and I will be returning. It was refreshing to see an employee like Alison speak highly of her job and the food items.  She went over the menu well and the service was excellent.  We had fried deviled eggs.  They were a new twist on an old favorite.  I had a house salad but you have a choice to add in seared steak.  I highly recommend it.  The steak was tender and delicious.  Make sure you get a reservation.  It is hard to get in otherwise.,5
Wow. Jeff our waiter was over the top awesome. We had a group of 15 and he keep up with everything and made for an awesome experience. The food and drinks were also amazing! Everything made fresh. Can't go wrong here.,5
Everything was good except the  coleslaw should be taken off the menu,4
Great burgers. Very busy place but large space and service was good,4
Food was great. Burgers were huge. Had ahi tune was amazing. The fish and chips were delicious.,5
Great service and amazing food! The onion rings was huge and the burgers were amazing! Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting to stop in and eat.,5
"Good food, clean place, SLOW service. Slow as in an hour wait (no problem at all), over an hour to get our food that was wrong and another 45 to get some of it corrected but after 3 hours some never even showed up still... no one got a refill even when we kept nicely asking.",4
"Great recommendation from Restorative Massage. The food was amazing, the place clean and staff were great.",5
"Excellent quality of food, very fresh, the fried green tomatoes appetizer was very good and the ribs were amazing!  Our server Alison was the best - attentive and a real pro!",5
"Good service and food was pretty good. Kids had good meals and my wife loved the burger. The ribs were not great. Overall, recommended!",4
"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. We are visiting from Oklahoma and had the hardest time finding food and service we liked while here bit this place was amazing!!!! The food was absolutely delicious, the staff were nothing less than kind and courteous and I love their food is from farm to table. The food is sooooo good for sure",5
"Amazing food! Our server, Maria, was outstanding! Highly recommend!",5
It was the best ever big group of us we all had great food and great service,5
"This was the only place open until 10, so we stopped in for dinner. Our waitress Maria was amazing and a great help. I ordered the BGT (I think that's what it was called) and added a fried egg. It was non traditional, filling, and tasty, and had a really good size. Nachos were pretty good, and the wings were good too.
Overall, this place was a good find and I'm glad we went. We will be coming back soon.",5
"Very nice restaurant, it took a little for the waiter to get to us but that was understandable for how busy it was. I had the ribs and they were so filling and yummy that I took home the extras. Very kind staff",5
"Food was good, no place to wait(expected to wait in car). Not allowed to order a drink and sit or stand outside(Alcohol or otherwise) had to be seated.",4
Great food. Super variety. Excellent service.,5
This place was recommend by a friend great food glad we stopped in,5
Delicious black and bleu burger! Deep fried deviled eggs were a nice appetizer! Great service....call in advance for reservations.,5
"Excellent service and amazing farm fresh style food. Prices were very reasonable for the food and drinks. We really enjoyed the fried deviled eggs, ribeye, and burger!",5
"1st time there. Barbecue chicken sandwich good.  Get lots of fries, they were ok.  They would have been better if they were crisp.  Our server was just adequate.",4
"My wife and I have been going here since it was called The Billy Goat Tavern. Items to try are the deep fried deviled eggs, pimento cheese burger, and for dessert try the bread pudding. We have NEVER had a bad meal or experience there. They are extremely busy now even in the off season so reservations are recommended.",5
This was our favorite meal on our recent vacation. The grilled chicken sandwich was amazing and so were the steak kabobs. Highly recommend visiting!,5
"Place is always packed, so know going in that your probably going to be waiting to be seated. Food was ok mostly. The fried green tomatoes were very tasty. Not much else to say.",3
Very good food. Great service. A lil pricey but good value for your money.,5
"Fast service, food out very quick. Food is all Good! Try the deviled eggs!I",5
"Amazing food with a server who was personal, prompt and very informed about menu items!  Highly recommend.",5
"Great food, great staff. Little bit of a wait for the food and it was a bit crowded, but still well worth it. The portions were HUGE so come with an empty stomach!",4
"Amazing food one of the best restaurants in Pigeon forge,  a must try, great ombiance, excellent service.",5
"After 3 restaurant let downs on our vacation we decided to come here because of the reviews. Was not disappointed. Came at lunch got right in, service was excellent. Our waiter was Mike.. food was hot and good. I would be willing to come back next visit to TN.",5
I had the harvest salad. It came with roasted butternut squash which I didn’t think would possibly be good but it was delicious! Everyone that ordered steak in my group said it was very tender. Will definitely be back.,5
One of the best ribeye steaks that I have ever had,5
Fantastic locally sourced food. The staff were also very gracious and friendly.,5
"The food was amazing.

Most small attention to detail was taken, and the combination of good food, and flavors they were paired with were excellent.

Completely above par and surprisingly delightful.",5
Great food (locally sourced) and wonderful service.,5
Food was great service was wonderful I enjoyed my steak my wife enjoyed her meal just was not a fan of the appetizer of Fried Green Tomatoes I normally like them but the way they prepare there's it was like eating a piece of cardboard,4
"My wife and I drove past this place and it appeared very busy.  We searched for some reviews and found it was very highly rated in the area.  We decided to give it a shot and WERE NOT disappointed!
They do take reservations but also serve walk-in guests.  They do not offer call ahead seating.  Even though they were quite busy our wait for a party of 2 was only about 30 mins.
The staff was very friendly. The service was slightly slow but that was to be expected since they had a full house.
We had the Deep Fried Deviled Eggs for an app.  Super good if you like deviled eggs.  It has candied bacon and sriracha sauce on top. (Photo of this included)
My wife had the 7oz Sirloin and a crab cake. The steak was perfectly cooked and very tender for a sirloin. The crab cake was pretty tasty, but she felt like she might have preferred the coconut shrimp with it instead.
I had the Hawaiian Ribeye.  It was spectacular. Perfectly cooked and the marinade was delicious.
The side salads were great too.  Homemade croutons, bacon, boiled eggs, and salad dressing too. Quite elaborate for a side salad.
They serve locally-sourced food when possible.
All in all, a very good experience.  Highly recommend.",5
"Great food! Very fresh and definitely one of the better restaurants in the Pigeon Forge area. I highly recommend the deep fried deviled eggs and lamb burger! Will definitely be a regular stop when I visit Gatlinburg!

*My only critique is on the fries. They were just ok and too thin.",5
"Was excellent,  best to make reservations due to crowd.",5
All of the food that we had was very good. Service was a little slow. Hour wait and it took 1 he and 45 minutes to eat appetizer and main meal due to the time it took to prepare the meal. But all the food was very good. The ribs were delicious. We will return and hopefully we will have faster service.,5
"The only complaint I have was the wait. I was a little disappointed that we had to wait outside in the heat for an hour and a half, but, that is everywhere these days. I had called earlier in the day to make a reservation and was told I couldn’t. However, there were four people ahead of us who said they had. I am guessing they were that busy?? I’m not sure.
Once we finally got in, sat down and cooled off, the service was excellent and the food was delicious. I just wish I had felt like exploring the menu instead of getting a salad.",4
"My husband and I stopped at the Local Goat a week or so ago for the first time. We put our name in and of course waited, which we were fine with because it is always packed. We got a message our table was ready within the time we were told. We were seated and our waitress, Tiffany, came and took our drink order. She came back with our drinks and took our dinner order because we were ready. It took a little while to get our food, but we didn't mind. We knew they were extremely busy. She came and apologized several times for our wait. When our food was ready, my wings had no sauce, which wasn't a big deal to me. I just had her bring some sauce. We ate and enjoyed our food. It was really good. My husband got one of the burgers and loved it. When it was time for our check, our waitress brought out our check and our total was zero. She felt we waited to long for our food and talked to the manager about it who took care of the bill. We never once complained about anything. I highly recommend this restaurant. We make several trips to Pigeon Forge a year and this will now be on our must stop list of restaurants while we are there.",5
Great hamburgers!! So many to choose from. All ingredients are from local farmers. Fast service but a little loud (like cracker barrel). I highly recommend this place!,5
"My family and I went here on a Thursday evening. We were told a 30-45 minute wait and was seated within 20 minutes. When we sat down we met Janice, who was our waitress, and ordered our drinks. When she returned she explained that all of the sauces and food items were all made from scratch. I ordered a hamburger with French fries and we also had the onion rings for an appetizer. The onion rings were the size of actual onions and the jalapeno ranch dip was absolutely amazing. My burger was nothing short of perfection. The bun was thick enough so that it didn't get messy and the ingredients tasted fresh. The whole experience was enjoyable and we will definitely be heading back every time we are in Pigeon Forge. Janice was an absolute sweetheart and took the time to explain the menu and was always available when we needed something.",5
Loved the lamb burger! Will be back to try other menu options.,5
"It was really busy with large parties so, our waiter was too busy for us.. Food wasn't any thing special. Just my opinion. Half order onion rings were good..",3
Food is pretty good and we were seated very quickly. Service was top knotch!,5
"Absolutely the best restaurant in Pigeon Forge, TN. Multiple visits and the only drawback is withdrawal between visits. The Ribs are bar none their best item.",5
Food and service was excellent! I highly recommend.,5
The food and drinks were great! My husband ordered pasta and I had steak. Everything we had was so good. This restaurant is a must visit when coming to the Gatlinburg area!,4
"We went on a Saturday night,  very busy, they were booked up for reservations so we had about an hour wait. But it was worth the wait, the food was great and the service was exceptional! Jeremy P. took great care of us! Hard to believe the food can come out so quickly and be so good and the server so attentive when they are so busy, our waiter had a lot of other tables but after being seated, we didn't wait long for anything. The long wait to be seated makes sense, they are really popular for a reason. We went across the street and did a wine tasting while we waited, which was a good way to kill time if you do have to wait. I would recommend making reservations as.esrly as possible to avoid a long wait, but again totally.worth it! Huge selection of whiskey and awesome cocktails too.",5
Great atmosphere and the food was beyond delicious!!,5
"Our server, Zachary P, was very prompt and gave us great service! the fried deviled eggs were delicious and I could’ve bathed in the lobster crab bisque. Just had my first bite of the white chocolate bread pudding..... y’all gotta come here",5
Great food,5
I loved the cheese fondue. Everything we ordered tasted great. They did have to refire my steak as they over cooked but where fast and happy to fix it fast.,5
"I absolutely loved this place. The whole reason we decided to try it is because we saw a picture of what looked like fried deviled eggs when we googled the restaurant. Turns out they are even more delicious than they look! I also had the best mojito I've ever had in my life, and the lamb burger was simply to die for. Juicy, flavorful, and perfectly made. I am so glad we went here even though it was a little out of the way. Give it a try; I'm confident that you wont be disappointed. Sorry I didnt post a pic of the burger. It was just so good that I scarfed it down before I had the chance!",5
Server was very attentive. Atmosphere was nice. Food was delicious.,5
The food was amazing our party of 8 all tried something different and there were no complaints. The staff was very friendly( except for the guy taking reservations... I believe he was having a bad day.) but I highly recommend putting your name in and waiting for the hour because the wait it totally worth it.,5
Great place to stop in for a meal..Great menu selections. Plan on a wait to be seated.,5
Fresh products. Very tasty. Service excellent! A must visit in Pigeon Forge.,5
Love this place it is a must go to and visit and eat. Great staff great food.,5
"I know they have the cute animal as a mascot...But in this case Goat stands for GREATEST OF ALL TIME!  Austen B was the epic server that took care of everything. All local stuff. Green tomatoes were better than my (or your) grams made. Serving size for the actual meal was huge, come hungry, leave happy and fat lol! Mmm the bread pudding 👏😮",5
"Great food, fondue and burgers were very tasty.  They were able to accommodate multiple food allergies within our party and the wait staff was amazing.  Tight parking lot.",5
"The food was amazing!!!!! The service was very good for such a busy place! Parking was tricky with a big truck but the spaces were wide enough for it to fit!
So good, definitely recommend! Will most likely go back in the future!",5
The best shrimp and grits EVER!!!,5
Had the deep fried deviled eggs as an appetizer. Excellent 👌.,5
"Fun place.  Terrific menu.  Our server was Raven (a guy!).  A great, friendly down home kinda fellow.  He did a great job.  Food was quite good.  Deep fried deviled eggs were unexpected but quite tasty.  Burger and bread pudding dessert were quite good.  Atmosphere was fun and exciting.  All in all a verse nice experience.",5
"It's rare I have this level of quality outside of Chicago. Fantastic service and food, but be warned: the place is BUSY...but for good reason.",5
"Awesome food and service. Phenomenal place to eat,and will definitely go back.",5
Our waiter was AWESOME. Food however was gross. Don’t understand the hype,1
"Love it! My second favorite restaurant here. Food is yummy and rhe service is always great! We usually get the same guy but I can't remember his name, he is awesome. I had the crab cakes and mashed potatoes and hubby had the burger and fries and we were both very satisfied! We will be back again and again!",5
"It was too much hype. We kept hearing how other people liked this place, but the steaks were okay at best. Definitely would not have paid over 70 dollars for two bland steaks if we had known better.",3
Absolutely loved this place! Dillon was our server and he did an outstanding job helping us with our food selection for our daughter with food allergies. Best food in Pigeon Forge!,5
"Does not live up to the hype. Everyone we spoke to said it was great. It started only good. The waiter was nice, but none of the staff seemed to smile. I might not be happy either, serving a hundred hungry tourists every day unless my tip depended on my demeanor. Ours made a joke that none of us got, but we laughed just the same. We heard such good things about the Local Goat. I ordered an Elvis burger with a gluten free bun and no side. The giant burger came on a 6-inch saucer and not a plate. I picked it up and the bun disintegrated in my hands, a sure sign that it was more than three days old. When the waiter saw it he only offered to bring me a new bun. No apology or offer to remake the sandwich, just replace the bun. By the time I had 3 bites, my spot at the table looked like a child learning to eat sat there. I had to ask our waiter to clean up the mess. He did not, but he took the plate away at least. No other mention of my sorry excuse for a sandwich. I had to tell him to take it off the bill! He did say, ""I offered to replace the bun."" Worst gluten free burger ever and I have Celiac's so I've been eating them for a long, long time. I do not recommend unless an expensive, OK burger served by a surly waiter is what you are looking for. In that case, enjoy.",2
"Great service; great food! Had cheese fondue, fried green tomatoes (unique recipe, sprinkled with goat cheese n caramelized onions), and a great burger. Like the fact of using all local and in house breads, etc.",5
Great food and great service. Book ahead and get there early to get a parking spot.,5
First time eating there. Food was great.,5
Awesome food.  Deep fried deviled eggs. Great staff. Must have desserts.,5
Super crowded. My fries tasted like they were under a heat lamp. Ribs were ok.,3
"Great family place, food and service.",5
We were on vacation.   Make a reservation!!  If you don’t you can still go and wait and I’ll tell you….  It’s worth the wait!  This was by far my favorite restaurant all week!!!,5
"Awesome resturant, had the bcg burger, med rare, excellent burger, friendly excellent staff and great service, walk ins welcome but reservations are a little easier",5
"SAD!!! Waited all week to eat here. We waited an hour (which we understand) they overcooked my husband's burger not ONCE BUT TWICE. Fries were so filled with grease can't even eat them. So, he had to watch me eat my dinner and now we have to go to another restaurant and wait to get him dinner. They took off his hamburger because he didn't eat it but then charged him for his sweet tea. Really??? You couldn't take that off  for the terrible experience? I know it's petty but adding insult to injury. Won't be coming back.",1
AMAZING. My boyfriend ordered the portobello sandwich which a loaded baked potato - the potato was so good 🤤 I'm sad I don't live in Tennessee because I would come to this place often if I did. I 10/10 recommend.,5
Amazing food and such a great change of pace from the usual places around town. Shrimp and grits were the best I've ever had and my wife's burger was amazing as well. Even our kid's hot dogs were great. This is a must visit.,5
My wife & I ate there for the first time last night !  got to say they are awesome great food & great service !! We Loved it !!!! If I could give 10 Stars I would !!,5
"THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUS. We ordered their version of chicken alfedo (don't remember the exact name) and it was delicious, husband ordered the Elvis burger and one of the burgers with goat cheese on it, he said they were amazing. We got the kids cheeseburger for my kid and she loved it, HUGE helping of fries with each burger. We also got onion rings, they were awesome as well as the jalepeno ranch and the homemade ketchup. They make EVERYTHING there from scratch and I can't wait to go back one day!",5
"We ear at the Local Goat regularly. The food and service was great, even though our two favorite servers weren't working today.",5
Really awesome food.. went here twice...deep fried deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes are delicious.. Also Chicken tenders.. Recommended,5
Great food and friendly service even though they were busy.,5
We loved the Local Goat! Definitely try the friend deviled eggs- they are very delicious despite initial impressions if you like deviled eggs. My husband had the lamb burger and said it was very delicious. I had bacon cheeseburger and it was cooked perfectly and delicious as well. My kids had cute little fruit cups with their meals. The service was great and attentive. Definitely make reservations online because it's busy.,5
The food was awesome and the service was great!! The server had great suggestions and was very attentive!!,5
Deep fried deviled eggs. That is all I have to say.,4
Food was good! Our server Robert was even better!,4
First time eating here.Go early cause it's busy but it's definitely worth it. We ate at the bar and the bar keep was great.Most all their items are sourced locally.. Beer selection is awesome.Burgers and fries were delicious. Highly recommended !,5
Ribs were great fast service great waiter definitely would come back,5
Very delicious and completely unique meals.  They knocked the steak nachos out of the park!!!  Burgers were out of this world and unlike anything I've tasted before and definitely handcrafted ingredients.  Highly recommend for fast service and great food!,5
It was fine. A little better than Applebee’s. Not a whole lot better tho. Just fine. I’m not sure why the line goes around the building for this place.,3
"Large menu, great service, 3 of the 4 meals were good. The Ahi Tuna appetizer was supposed to be seared but wasn't.",4
"Every time we drove by for dinner this place is PACKED. So we made a reservation to check it out! Is it worth it? I will say yes for the most part.

The appetizers were only okay for us. We tried the fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs. The tomatoes were a little tough though the carmelized onion and sauce/cheese made up for that. The eggs were good. Maybe even better if brought out hot.

The main coarse is what made the visit worth our while. We got a ribeye that was melt in your mouth amazing with the perfect amount of char and seasoning. And two burgers that were HUGE in size and flavor. I would easily return with a reservation to try out more of their burger combos.",4
Got in quickly and the food was good. Really enjoyed the white chocolate bread pudding.,4
I am a burger guy and this place threw me off. Honestly probably the best burger I’ve ever had. Highly recommend,5
"You're going to wait to eat here, but you'll be glad you did. It's a broad menu with plenty of options, many of which are well executed. Servers are knowledgeable and efficient. This place has earned it's full parking lot. A great meal with something on the menu for everyone.",5
One of the few restaurants in the area that accept reservations. Service was great but I liked the steaks better from southern comfort restaurant located in west gate resort. All other items were good.,5
"Would recommend if you are in the area. They have a wide variety of food and drinks. The entire building is up to date with looks good inside. With how busy it is, it does not have a very lively atmosphere and the server we had was not the greatest. But still a good spot.",4
"The food was just okay, but the service was great",3
"The food was great.  Pricey for lunch,  but worth the dine.",4
"Wow! This place was amazing! I ordered the strip combo (Loaded baked potato, strip, and shrimp) So flavorful! When you can easily eat all of your cut of beef without spitting out any fat, you know it's good. The third best cut of meat I'd ever had. Farm to table fresh and really good prices. I'm married with 5 children. $60+/- was the bill. In this area, you can't beat that, especially for the professional dishes you'll get.",5
Quick seating in bar area...n it was packed. Shrimp n Grits delicious. .husband loved the Cole slaw. Our waiter was on top of everything 👍👍. Was a group of about 12 older woman behind us...laughing and enjoying themselves never heard one complaint...that there alone is 5 star service n meal satisfaction.,4
WOW...a MUST VISIT.  GOAT stands for Greatest Of All Time and they are.  If they were in Knoxville I would be there once a week! Unbelievable burgers and the deep fried deviled eggs are an excuse to visit on there own.,5
I've been wanting to try this place every time we come to Tennessee and I wasn't disappointed very good beer and liquor selection and the food was amazing you will wait a bit but it's well worth it,5
"Incredible food! Onion rings, fried deviled eggs, shrimp and grits, and Mason jar sundae!! All fantastic",5
"Friendly staff,the waiter was amazing and delicious food.",5
"First time visiting. Wait was 20 minutes longer than quoted (dinner rush + hiring challenge= understandable delays). Servers were friendly, made recommendations, and kept the drinks full. Good food in a casual atmosphere. Will definitely be back!",5
Make reservations...great food ..great service,5
"Good service, good nachos. Their specialty are burgers. For a good local lunch place, I recommend it.",3
So good. There were 7 of us and everyone was happy.,5
The absolute best food I have EVER had. I’m so glad I got to eat here while I was on vacation.,5
"Food Excellent, Frys are unbelievable. Staff top notch.  No complaints here.",5
"Great service at the bar. Excellent beer selection. The burgers were phenomenal. The fries were a little too crunchy for my taste, I’d probably pick a different side if I got a burger again.",5
"Unique restaurant, sort of a elaborate tavern food place, great Appetizers try the"" fried deviled egg "" .",4
"Reservations were made for brunch, on Mother's Day. While the food and service were very good, they were out of two menu items at 12:30. Otherwise, pleasant dining experience.",4
"Very clean. Staff or  Employees were clean friendly had a nice smile on there face's. I will definitely would go back again. I wish we had a Local Goat in Greenwood, Indiana.",5
"Food is good, service is the worse. Waiting on refill for sweet tea since before meal was served. Meal finished, ready to pay and leave still waiting. Party of 6, the only one to recieve a refill was the 6 year old at our table.",1
"Great atmosphere, amazing food",5
"First visit, we loved it!  Center-cut sirloin was excellent.  It was tender, very flavorful and perfectly grilled.  The shrimp and grits were as good as any we've had! They were well-seasoned, with great texture.  Service could not have been better.  We will definitely return soon.",5
"Service- amazing, Food- repulsive. My salad was very bitter and barely edible. My chicken in the salad had a bone or something hard that cut my gums. Everyone else at my table enjoyed it, so it was very sad to have the only plate that was almost untouched. It cost $15 for that salad too!",1
Excellent food. Restaurant smelled like pee when you walk in the door.,5
Great place to have a light lunch or heavy dinner. Some good southern door with a twist. I ordered some fried green tomatoes and some crab cakes 😋...the server was great and even showed us some magic tricks. Good beers and drinks .,5
Delicious food! Very nice waiter. A bit slow but the food made up for it!,5
Food was good. There was a mildew smell throughout the restaurant though. Service was good.,4
We had amazing food and great service!  This restaurant did not disappoint!,5
"We tried a few times to get reservations online. It was difficult to find openings and the reservation system left a lot to be desired. We finally got in for lunch on Sunday. The service at the restaurant was excellent and we were able to get right in with our reservation. The food was excellent...we ordered the Billy Burger and Lamb burger, both were delicious.",5
"Stood waiting at the check-in for 5-6 minutes alone.  Never could get anyone to wait on us to put our name on a list for a table.  Hostess or whoever was working the front was laughing and talking to other people even looking and noticing us but still we received no service.

We left and went to Alamo Steakhouse...one of the best bone-in ribeyes ever!

I hear Local Goat is great but we weren't given the time of day.  So your experience may vary.  Wish our experience was different.",2
Food was all cooked very well they were extremely busy but still was excellent.,5
"Excellent fresh food and even better service. They don't take reservations and it can be a long wait. We managed to snag a couple of seats at the bar within 10 minutes (it was.o er an hour wait, otherwise.)",5
This place is great and our server Jeff made us feel at home!,5
Great food and wonderful service. Even though it was packed only 20 minutes for the 12 of us,5
"The food was delicious.. Fish and chips, 10 oz sirloin with baked potato. Spinach artichoke dip for appetizer...",5
"Awesome food, the onion rings are to die for. The serving sizes are very large but that seems to be part for course for eateries in Pigeon Forge. Service was good and it feel like they were trying to rush you so tables would turn. We will be back.",5
"Great food!!! Great service!! Everyone loved their food. Even tried the deep fried deviled eggs. The crab cake, billy burger and whiskey burgers were wonderful. The fries were delicious!! We'll  be back for sure!!",5
"Amazing food and service!! Can't wait to go back! Never had fettuccine Alfredo with that much flavor. If my taste buds were on death row and they got to chose one last meal, they would chose the fettuccine Rocco!.. Also fried deviled eggs. Unbelievable!",5
Omg!! The best place in this area!! Everything is corporate processed junk in this area except this place & the bistro beside the courthouse! Always fresh local organic ingredients! No processed junk here! The pimento cheese burger is a must! Desserts are good also! We will be back!,4
"Wow!!! Great food and friendly staff. The food tasted amazing and was made of products they make at their onsite location. If you are looking for a place to eat with amazing food, friendly staff, and affordable prices I highly recommend giving this place a try!",5
Best food we had during our week stay!  Only bad things is they are so busy (because everything was so good!) I almost don't want to let anyone else in on it!,5
We decided to try the Local Goat on our last day visiting. We were extremely happy we did. Everything was surprisingly good and the service was good as well. They were super busy so get there early. Food was fresh and they carry a great drink menu.,4
Had read about this restaurant before going to Pigeon Forge and wanted to try it. We really enjoyed it. Food was really good and you got plenty. Service was good. We will go back when we are in the area again.,5
"Great food, great service, no wait time:)",5
Great food. Awesome experience,5
This place is our new favorite!! The service was very good and the food was FANTASTIC!,5
"Visited on February 18, 2021, around 6:30pm. There was a 30 min wait for a party of 7 which wasn't too bad. Service was great. Our waitress was super nice. Food was excellent. We had a little variety of things from burgers, fish and chips, crab cakes, and kabobs. All was really good!!",5
"I didn't realize this was a chain restaurant till it was pointed out by my family.  Great atmosphere, cozy yet not crowded. Food was quite good (especially the deep fried deviled eggs YUM!) and the service was quite good. When my baked potato wasn't as hot as I'd have liked, they brought me a whole new one right away. Very happy and want to try some other things on the menu next time. (A compliment in itself because i usually get one thing at any given place).

TLDR; Nice atmosphere, tasty food, excellent service. Would recommend.",5
Food here is fantastic. Excellent service. Very good beer selection. Gets super busy here so I'd strongly recommend reservations.,5
"I DO NOT SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT THIS PLACE!!  We were in Pigeon Forge in August and every time the wait was over an hour, we came back this April and made a reservation, I heard the hostess that the wait then was over an hour wait, sorry but it was NOT worth it!!  The food was mediocre at best.  I do appreciate their ideas of using locally grown items, but the taste was just not there.  I could have gotten better food in other local restaurants without the outlandish wait times.   The wait staff was not very enthusiastic, he seemed to have cared less if we needed anything before, during or after our meal.  I will not be going back there anytime soon.  I’ll go to one of the other local restaurants next time I’m in town.",2
Food and Service was great our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about everything on the menu,5
"Great food. Very filling. Great service.
Fried deviled eggs, fish n chips, pimento burger.",5
Memorable food and service which means I want to go back!,5
My favorite place place to eat. Food is fantastic.  They have fried deviled eggs and best shrimp and grits you will ever get.,5
"Good food, good service. Very crowded the night we visited but despite the crowd the food was hot and delivered quickly.
Though it may sound weird the ketchup was a nice surprise.  They take regular ketchup and step it up a bit.  Best ketchup I've ever tasted.",5
Decent food and not too long of a wait. Good beer selection,4
"The ribs were most tender and best I have ever had, and i have eaten a lot! My wife had the chicken n rice n broccoli said it was great too. Service was very good too",5
"My wife and I were just travelling through Pigeon Forge, looked at some reviews, and decided to try this restaurant.  We were not disappointed. I had the Shrimp and Grits... they were very good.",5
"I have heard this place recommended many times on social media and decided to try it on our first trip to Pigeon Forge. It was excellent!! Very, very busy and still waited only about 30 mins to be seated. Well worth the wait!! Those burgers are something else...the flavor of combos are intriguing and delicious. I had the BGT, my husband had The Elvis...who knew peanut butter and fried banana on a burger would taste sooooo good. Mind is blown!!! Our son had the chicken tender platter and we chose the Cheese Fondue for an appetizer. Everything was perfect and tasty. Our server was prompt and courteous. He made great recommendations and though he was extremely busy,  he was very attentive and took great care of us. From start to finish...5 stars on everything!!!  🌟",5
Great food! Great service! Bella was an awesome server. We looooved the cheese platter appetizer. Overall great experience!,5
Food was good but there's no place to wait inside because of covid restrictions and even outside there's only limited seating.,4
"If you are in the area, you must go to this restaurant.  We all split the deep fried deviled eggs, fried green tomatoes, and flights of jello shots and all were delicious.  I had the shrimp and grits and it was amazing.  Everyone loved everything they had.",5
Food was so good and service from the bartenders was better!,5
They staff was amazing...The food was the best food I have had in a long time at a restaurant. We will go back again!,5
"If you ever find yourself in the unfortunate situation of being in the Pigeon Forge/Gatlinburg area, this will partially make up for it.  Great food and service.  Prices were very reasonable.  Make a reservation if you can.",5
"Deep fried deviled eggs were an amazing start. The burgers, fries, and onion rings were all outstanding. Call ahead to skip the wait!",5
"It was ok, it stunk, it was freezing, food was ok, the bathrooms were clean. I would go to local goat if you just want to eat something but for a fancy meal I would not.",3
Great food and service,5
Over priced wings and burgers if your going to spend your money go to the Alamo in gatlinburg spend the money and get what you pay for and the service at the Alamo in gatlinburg is unmatched and the have the best steaks in the smokey mountains by far,3
"Heard good things and wanted to give it a try. Booked a reservation online (highly recommend). Everyone was very friendly and provided excellent service. Got the fried deviled eggs (I don't care for relish in my eggs so not for me, but still good). My husband's wings and fries delicious and I had the Alfredo Rocco. Yummm.",5
"Food and service was awesome! I will be back. Lil B, the owner is super sweet.",5
"After years trying to get in this place, we finally did. Kyle was great and knowledgeable of the menu and he was 100 percent right with his offerings. The fried green tomatoes were to die for. My pimento cheese burger was mind blowing and my husband's ribs were falling off the bone insane.  We will be back and if there is a line we will wait. Food good, service great, and price was just right.",5
"It was quite the experience. The food was delicious, presentation was amazing and all with a local with a spin on it. Our server Ben Dawson was simply amazing. He was very attentive and even surprised us with a mini dessert to help celebrate our anniversary...that we only mentioned when he asked if we had been there before when offering suggestions. The owner's wife even stopped by the table to ask about our experience...the care shown to their patrons was beyond amazing! We will be visiting again.",5
Visiting from Illinois and this restaurant was the best so far. Excellent service from our waitress Alice and delicious burgers. We love that it's farm to table and so fresh. Thank you for a great dining experience. Keep up the great work.,5
"Good food, good service ! Make a reservation  to go.",5
Sooo good! Highly recommend!!,5
The best food in Pidgeon Forge Tennessee. Locally sourced and everything made in house .,5
"Food was amazing, service was great!
Will definitely make this a staple of our Gatlinburg trips in future.
It’s a little pricey, but well worth it",5
Loved the food.  Will be back,5
"Very delicious! I got the teriyaki kabobs. The meat was very tender, flavorful and soft. Amazing food and amazing staff.",5
Omg had been wanting to try this place for awhile but lots always packed which is a good sign...Finally went early today it was beyond amazing.  FOOD WAS DELICIOUS ITS NOW OUR FAVORITE PLACE IN THE SMOKIES AND OUR WAITRESS WAS THE BOMB..MISTY BEST SERVER AROUND💗💗💗,5
Great service and the food....well you WANT to wait 20 minutes for the table and you WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!  I was among a party of 4 and we simply couldn't eat everything!   I was on vacation so I would highly recommend this as lunch or dinner!! Headed back soon so that is great and fine dining!!,5
The most fun I've had visiting the Smoky Mountains,5
Service was excellent and the food was absolutely delicious.,5
"Pigeon Forge has a lot of great places to eat, so to be blown away by food and service isn’t that easy up there, but the GOAT did it. It exceeded my expectations. The wait takes a while, but it’s absolutely worth it. Jeff was our waiter and he was on top of everything. We had a table of 8 (4 adults and 4 kids) and we never needed anything. Jeff was always ahead of us and even at capacity their Restraunt was awesome. I will absolutely be back on our next vacation.",5
"Great atmosphere
Nice food & beverage selection
Will definitely dine there again",5
"DELICIOUS made from scratch,  and you can tell!! The Bisque was amazing!! My fettuccine Rocco was SOOOOOO good i forgot to take a picture! Love their unique drinks too! A MUST stop when you're here! You won't be disappointed!!",5
"Waiter was nice, they have a small army working here to keep it movin",5
"Food was incredibly delicious and the portions were generous. Our server was a total doll. Adult beverages were creative and tasty too.

I HIGHLY recommend you call ahead to get your name on the list. Local Goat is very popular - with good reason! The place was a zoo at dinner time on a Thursday. No parking spots left at all. We were told 45 minute wait on the phone, got there 40 minutes later and still had to wait another 30 minutes for a table.

SO worth it though. We had the cheese fondue for an appetizer and the pretzel bites served with it were phenomenal. I got the fried deviled eggs too. So many complex flavors on those eggs including candied bacon and a touch of sriracha. Really unique!

The burgers were massive and juicy and I lurved my lamb burger with taziki sauce! My son couldn't stop talking about his fish and chips. The homemade tartar sauce was so good.

My daughter wasn't thrilled with the steak nachos. Personally, I think they were awesome, but they are gourmet nachos, with a soy-based drizzle and pickled onions. I think she was expecting ballpark nachos. Just be warned the adult menu has mature flavors your kids may not be accustomed to!

Their cocktails were creative and delicious. My Blackberry Mountain Tea had vodka and muddled blackberries and my husband's Buckberry Old Fashioned was made with fig syrup and smoked rosemary that added an awesome mountain twist on an old classic. A note...the bartender on duty that night could use an attitude adjustment. We were there at 6:15 on June 20 if that helps you figure out who it was!

If you are in town and love delicious, unique food, don't miss Local Goat. The food and flavors can't be beat. Let me stress again CALL IN ADVANCE! It will save you some time and a hungry tummy!",5
"Deep fried deviled eggs appetizer was heaven. Amazing food , great service. One of my new favorite places",5
"Up on a hill on the Parkway. Ordered a Blackberry Mtn.Tea. Deliciously made with homemade fresh blackberry grenadine. I ordered the BBQ chicken nachos. These nachos are made with grilled chicken, homemade cheese sauce, BBQ sauce, guac, locally sourced cilantro, jalapanos, and onions. Soooooooo good!
Then I ordered the Lamb burger. It was moist, flavorful, and so tasty!!! It also came with shoestring fries. The fries were seasoned very nicely. Out waiter was very nice and explained answers to all our questions and offered up additional info that was very helpful. Overall, a very enjoyable experience. I recommend the ""Local Goat  Restaurant"" to anyone, they pretty much have anything your tummy desires.",5
The fries green tomatoes were out of this world. The food and service were amazing. Would recommend this establishment to anyone visiting PF.,5
The food was cold but the costumer service was good.,2
Great service and amazing food. Would definitely dine here if I come back to the area,5
Crowded forever but I liked vegetarian burger,5
Awesome place. Food and service was very good. Make a reservation,5
I went here because I was looking for organic. It was not as great as I thought it would be but it was ok. Mashed potatoes were good and the cheese with pretzels and apples were great.,3
Good but going down fast,4
"PHENOMENAL! SERVICE, FOOD, DRINKS, EVERYTHING!",5
"Mostly good food, French fries were nubs (like the bottom of the frozen fry bag) and not warm. Service was good, very friendly waitress.",4
"Great food, great service. We had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated.",5
"A little pricey, but it was pretty good! Try the fried deviled eggs ,  yum. Definitely worth a stop.",4
"Good in concept with the scratch kitchen, but is is a basic pub menu (bar food).

Pro
Great fries and homemade salad dressings

Cons
Craft beer list is dated and poorly detailed. Missing new development in the  beer industry.",3
"6.7

We discussed this while having dinner. If rated from 1 to 10 we'd give it 6.7

They did seem to be putting forth an honest effort to please. But...

For some reason we only got 1 menu? Maybe it was a mistake? But if that was intentional then I think it's poor practice. We felt rushed to look over the menu before the waitress came back for orders.

The food was good. But not spectacular. That's the biggest part of the 6 rating. Satisfied with the food. Not good enough to make a special trip back there to eat again. But good enough to deserve another choice on the menu if we did make it back there again.

Service was good and the waitress seemed genuinely interested in providing good service.

Our daughter was chilly from the room temperature. It was a little cool. Not really a knock on the restaurant. Just worth mentioning that in the wintertime it may be worth requesting the fully inner indoor part of the building.

Overall it was one experience. We spent $55 for 2 adults and a child. We had two burgers, sodas and an order from the kids menu. It was a little over priced but not outrageous from the effort and appearance of the food that we were served.",3
"It's a super popular place. They do the text system for your wait, which was good. As we went over to shop to pass the time. Told 30 to 45 minutes, it was only 20.
We did wait about 25 minutes for our food. I enjoyed my food, but the portabella wasn't hot. But I couldn't remember if they said it was a hot or cold sandwich. It didn't matter to me, I still thought it tasted great. And the cabbage with goat cheese was amazing. My son had a steak, and devoured it. We all finished our meals, and were stuffed.
I'm not sure how old this place is, but you can tell there have been a lot of customers.
Our waitress was very pleasant, even though we could tell she was getting tired. It was about 930 when we left. Food service is one of the hardest jobs. But she was still on top of her game.
The prices were decent, but the alcohol prices seemed high. I don't drink very often, so I'm not sure. But I did take pictures.",4
Everything we had at the table was prepared well and very good.,5
"Service is okay. Host did not welcome anyone who he came in contact with. Waitress was nice but hardly saw here on the floor.
Food is not worth the price not worth the hype. I’ve had a better hamburger elsewhere and the fries are soggy. I don’t know what others see in this place but I probably won’t return. They make their money just by people trying the place first due to the hype it’s given.",3
"I'm disabled and bad legs they placed us at very back of restaurant. Also had me sitting directly under cold air vent,waited 11/2 hours to eat then bought died trying to walk to the table then froze the whole dinner long",3
Amazing food in a casual atmosphere with top-notch staff.  Everything was perfect and I now have a new favorite to recommend!,5
Amazing food we had to visit 2x. Very family friendly. Definitely recommend the Elvis burger it was so good. And the mojitos were amazing! Also the bread pudding! Will be back once we are down that way again!,5
"Great food, customer server and attention.",5
"This place was amazing.

Just driving by, the parking lot was nearly full all the time.

The portion size was huge.

The half rack of meaty pork ribs is a full rack of ribs somewhere else.

The service was excellent.",5
The local goat is known for their big burgers but you ain't seen or tasted anything till you've had their ribs ! My husband and I went to try the burgers but when a 11 year old boy ordered the ribs and we seen them we just had to return and try them for ourselves.  No regrets!!,5
"Very good food! Support local! Strongly recommended. worth the value. We tried the side salad, teriyaki kabobs, coconut fried shrimp and the fettuccini  rocco. all were very good!",4
"Great casual restaurant in Pigeon Forge!
Service is good and food is always fresh. The kitchen takes a few minutes more than a chain restaurant but the food quality masks it worth the wait.",5
"Love this place . Best deepfried deviled eggs ever , best ribs ever and I absolutely in love with the Milton burger,  it's a big slab of tuna steak  instead of beef and it's delicious.  One of my favorite places to go. It's always busy for a reason.",5
Busy local place. Good food. Good drinks.,3
Decent food great atmosphere.  Steak was ok. Not great.,4
"This was an excellent experience! Our waiter, Victor, was an incredibly hard worker and extremely friendly. well worth the wait to get in!

The burger was FANTASTIC! The Shrimp and Crab Bisque, Cheese Fondue and Fries were each instant favorites.

Definitely the best place to eat a burger in East Tennessee.",5
Farm to table restaurant. EVERYTHING we ordered was amazing!! Service on point !! Waitress was great .,5
It was okay food. Really long wait unless you can get a high top in the bar section. REALLY friendly service. Great drink selection.,5
"I'm so glad my GF picked this place out. Fantastic food, fantastic service.  The Local Goat will definitely be a must stop spot for our Pigeon Forge vacations.",5
"Pros:
Variety of local brews and good service

Cons:
For the higher price (>$19) it’s not at the restaurant food quality, tasted more like frozen reheated or fast/quick food.

Starter Deviled fried egg was yummy!",3
Always crowded. Parking is a problem. Food is very good.,4
We eat here a few months ago it was great.,5
The Local Goat  is a great choice and will not disappoint. The food is locally sourced and very well done. The service is friendly and very knowledgeable on menu items and drinks. Can't wait to go back.,5
Delicious food and great service. This was such a great place outside of the usual chain restaurant choices in Pigeon Forge. I would definitely love to eat here again.,5
The local goat is one of the best restaurants in the pigeon forge area. Food was great and the wait staff were tremendous! Wait staff helped us pick spots to eat and places to go that weren’t going to be wasted of money or tourist traps. Would definitely go back.,5
Waited an hour for terrible food. The fries were good. Every chain restaurant I have ever been to is better than this place…. Needed to update my post- two hours later and I still feel sick to my stomach 🤢.,1
The place is clean and pretty. Only took us 20 minute wait time on a Monday night to get seated. The chicken and waffles I got was overly greasy.  And the syrup tasted a little awful.  The appetizer of deep fried deviled eggs was really good though. The fried green tomatoes were awful and saturated with grease. Anyone who knows anything about making good fried green tomatos should know after frying you lay them on paper towels to absorb all the oil before serving them.  They sent them out to us straight out of the deep fryer.  Awful just awful. Now concerning the waiter we had..... he only checked us for refills one time and that was it.  Took him forever to bring us our checks.  He was very attentive to the table behind us and could have easily checked on us each time he checked on them but instead he chose to mostly ignore us. He needs some retraining and much improvement.  I wasn't overly impressed this time with the food or the service.  However I   will give them one more try.  I'll definitely order the deep fried deviled eggs again as an appetizer but I'll try their burgers next time.  And I hope and pray I have a more attentive waiter next time. The pics I'm posting shows how greasy and unappealing the food was I ordered.  The owner really needs to make sure waiters give all their tables EQUAL attention.,2
Omg!! Food is great! The fried deviled eggs...to die for!,5
"My wife and I at dinner at Local Goat Pigeon Forge TN on 3/30/21. The place was busy and had a 1 + hour wait, but we fortunately made a reservation and were seated quickly. We both had great meals and the service was excellent. Restaurants in tourist trap locations like Pigeon Forge are hit-n-miss but this place is a hit. Definitely recommend.",5
Great food and great service. Our waiter Robert was excellent and very quick despite being packed full in the restaurant. Worth the hour wait.,5
Delicious food at decent prices. I got the BGT Burger. I recommend it. Their house salad is completely decked out and worth a gander if you are a salad person.,5
Best gluten free burger I have had at a restaurant.  Whipped sweet potatoes are a must have everytime I come here.,5
We have eaten at the local goat twice now when visiting Pigeon Forge.  The food is always excellent and the service is amazing too!  The fried devil egg and cheese fondue appetizers are so good.  I tried the shrimp and grits this time and they are different but probably the best I've had.  We will be back again!,5
"The wait was very manageable!
The food was O U T S T A N D I N G
Our server Jeremy was tip-top

Would definitely come again",5
"Delicious food, tasty cocktails and good customer service!  I would recommend making reservations because they are busy. You won't be disappointed!",5
"Back in October we were up the on vacation. We went one night for dinner and it was amazing! We had the best waitress (who's name I forgot but if you know who I'm talking about, she's got black hair and tattoos). Everything was so good we decided to go back again on our last night. All the food was just as good except for the kids mac and cheese which was so dry my daughter choked and it all came up. I thought for sure one of the many employees walking by would have stopped to see the chaos going on but no one did. The waiter who wasn't around much brought another one out but it was equally just as dry when really all both need was more cheese, so she didn't eat that. Anyway, we also told my parents to go a few weeks later on there vacation and they also loved it. I literally daydream about the fondue and can't wait to go back again.",5
Great quality food. Great service from Alana,5
"Best meal in Gatlinburg! Delicious, must stop and enjoy this farm to table restaurant!",5
20 mins wait was well worth it. The server was nice and friendly and the burger was on point. Everything is made from scratch which is mostly the reason place was packed I wish there some kind of social distance in place,4
Got the Billy Burger. It was delicious,4
"Make a reservation ahead of time, you may have to wait still but holy moly is it worth it! 🤤 You MUST get the deep fried deviled eggs. Our server said ""no trip to the local goat is complete without those.
You really can't go wrong ordering anything off the menu. It's a scratch kitchen, so everything is too good for it's own good. 😂",5
Best ever! Steak was perfection.,5
"The food was good, it was pretty crowded and the customer service was ok",3
"We tried this place on the spur of the moment. We were totally impressed by the staff, the quality of the food, the local options, and the whole experience. Take the staffs suggestions for what’s great. I love that there’s a place in very commercial Pigeon Forge that’s trying to promote eating local.",5
Awesome food! Good atmosphere! The hamburgers are huge and my wife got the Fettuccini Rocco.... It was the best ever!!!! Def going back here again!,5
"This place gets 5+ stars!  Everything exceeded expectations. I had the Farmhouses Burger. Awesome! Everything is made fresh there and you can taste it. My bride had a steak and both were the most tender we have had in a long time! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. It’s become too common at many other so-called steakhouses we go to that we have to send our steak back. Even something as small as dressing and the butter are made fresh on site and you can taste it!

We got there around 5:15 on a Friday and got seated right away. The dining room is very large to accommodate a large following.

Our server was exceptional. We were very thirsty from a day at the park and Raven kept our glasses full. This is also an area where we have noticed over time service has gotten worse at many restaurants. He was friendly and very helpful with the menu. He should be promoted to manager!!",5
Very Disappointed.  Will NEVER GO BACK!  After telling our server about allergies for one of our children he told us not to order the fries because of the cross contamination of egg however he never mentioned the egg used in the burger.  We ended up at the Urgent Care.  When I told the Manager all he said was we take allergies very serious end of story.  The server started to say he was not informed when I reminded him of his comment about the fries.  Someone from the Corporate Office owes this girl an apology.  This is the first time in 15 years that we have had a problem in a Restaurant so you do not take this SERIOUS.,1
"We were a party of 2 and when we were told that there would be a 20-30 min wait...it wasn't.  It didn't take long at all. The food was great and Cal, our server was good. This is a fun and Awesome restaurant.",5
"The TN Whiskey Glazed burger was amazing. It was juicy, delicious and fresh tasting. Same for the whipped sweet potatoes. I recommend trying this place.",5
Really enjoyed this casual dining experience overall! Started with the fried deviled eggs which were certainly unique and tasty! I would recommend them if you're a fan of regular deviled eggs for a fun twist. We ordered the ribeye and sirloin with the ribeye being very good plus being cooked to order correctly. Unfortunately the only issue we ran into was my girlfriend's sirloin was a smidge overcooked (Ordered Medium Well) but it was well done being on the dry side. Other than that their service was excellent but 100% recommend making a reservation as they are packed. We will certainly be returning to try other items!,4
Steak Nachos was awesome. The service from Robert was outstanding.,5
Best local clean food restaurant in the area.,4
Great service from Timothy.  This was our first visit and I will return.  Food was good but I am not a fan of thin short fries.  Pimento cheese burger was great.,4
This is the best smoked pork chop I've ever had. We also got the fondue dip and it was to die for.,5
Appetizers were great. We had fondue pretzels and deep fried deviled eggs.  Burgers were good but the buns tasted stale (everyone at the table's thought so). Service was perfect.,3
Best food ever!  Returned several times during our visit!,5
"Always a pleasure to dine here,had the fried deviled eggs ,I shared, but i wanted more lol the Hawaiian ribeye was delicious , great atmosphere",5
First time here but definitely not the last! Absolutely a great atmosphere. Superb staff and the food is AMAZING! Locally sourced and made on site at the time of order makes a huge difference in the quality and taste of the food! This will be one of our go to places from now on!,5
Homemade. Great quality and freshness.,5
Great food !  Awesome drinks.,5
"Nice restaurant. Great food!!! One of the best burgers you will ever eat. You have to try the steak nachos to start with. I will advise you to make reservations or be ready to wait a little bit, but it is worth it. Place is always pack because of the good food.",5
Great place to eat! Food and service was on spot!,5
Delicous! Best spinach dip,5
"My shrimp was cold, no flavor, no seasoning whatsoever!
My husband's fries were cold.
Never got water refilled after we were told he would be back to refill.
The restaurant has a stench like wet rug or something.
Save your time and money and go elsewhere!!",2
"Great food and service, get a reservation they are very busy.",5
Great service and food. The cheese fondue is delicious and an endless appetizer. We had steak and a pork chop dinner. Both were cooked to perfection. My only regret is not saving room for dessert.,5
"Great food, the workers were very friendly",5
Amazing dinner. Their juicy burgers. Cool Jello shots. Everything we ordered was flawless. Would recommend this to anyone who visits pigeon forge.,5
"To start the evening correct, our party of 4 was seated right away, our server (Zach) was right on the job the whole time.  Our meal started with the Deep Fried Deviled Eggs, and they were amazing. I ordered the Billy Burger, the swiss cheese was great, and the burger was cooked perfectly. Great experience, and a great last dinner here in Tennessee.",5
"Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable on everything on the menu, loved Alex,  shout out to her. The food was great, one of the rare timesy steak was cooked the EXACT way I asked,  medium.",5
Burger options! Great wings too!,5
"Great atmosphere, Great Food, Great Service.  Having to wait outside in heat when they have seats in A/C Lobby was rediculus.",4
Best burger I've ever had,5
I saw numerous cars at the Local Goat so I thought it must be fantastic!!!! The service was absolutely fantastic but the food was lacking taste. I ordered the shrimp and crab bisque which tasted good but was lukewarm and too thick......then I ordered the half rack of ribs and tenderloin shiskabob. The waitress said the ribs were the best shed ever had.....naw naw....no flavor and awful bbq sauce....but they were tender like they'd been boiled. The tenderloin tasted ok but it was tough like sirloin.,3
"This was by far our favorite restaurant we visited in Pigeon Forge. The wait is long, but totally worth it. We had fast, friendly service, and the ribs were to die for. If you're in Pigeon Forge, you must stop for a bite to eat.",5
"While staying at the Hampton Inn in Ooltewah, Tennessee (I was traveling from out of state), I went to the Local Goat restaurant which is right next door.  There was a lot of people waiting to be seated so I figured the food must be pretty good. I called in an order for pick up. The food was ready by the quoted time I had been given. Once back in the hotel room, the disappointment came.  I ordered their marinated tenderloin kabob with fried rice and steamed broccoli.  My mom is vegan so she ordered the plant based burger with fries. My rice was awful. It had a few orange pieces in it that was supposed to be carrots.  The rice itself was extremely overcooked to the point that it was mushy. The broccoli was un-seasoned and pretty much overcooked also.  I asked for my beef to be cooked medium well(some pink), it was very rare. My mom's fries were greasy and unappetizing but she said the ""burger"" was ok. My advice,  choose somewhere else to eat",1
Awesome 👌,5
"Many good items on menu. We especially enjoyed cajun shrimp appetizer, shrimp and grits as well as Hawaiian chicken",5
"Fabulous place! Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, amazing food and drinks! We were vacationing over Thanksgiving break and made 8pm reservations for 2. We got done with our other adventures early so decided to head over and check out the bar. Bartender was fun and friendly, very skilled. I had a local seasonal cider, my husband had a couple signature cocktails, both were great! They seated us early for dinner, despite being slammed. I ordered the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer, they were Devine! My husband got a steak, I got the shrimp and grits. His steak was flavorful and cooked perfectly, very well seasoned. And these were the best shrimp and grits I've ever had, and I've lived and traveled in the south most of my life. The bacon jam should be bottled and sold! It was nice to find a farm to table restaurant in the middle of all these chain restaurants. Well worth the price! Can't wait to go back, will definitely stop by every time we are in town. Absolutely amazing!!!",5
"Very good food and our server Nick was very informative since we have never ate here, he was a really big help and kind. We tried burgers and grilled chicken salad. No complaints.
We will definitely be back to try the ribs and steak!",5
This place was absolutely amazing. The food and the atmosphere were great. We ended up going there twice during our week in Gatlinburg. Definitely make reservations a coupe of days in advance. Food is absolutely delicious and next time we are in town we will definitely go back. Go check it out!,5
Is a very busy place the service was right on top of it good job . her name was Jessica. I would go back,5
The hospitality was 2nd to none.,5
Grwat services and food was good would gave 5 star but deep fried eggs was slightly on the cool side and I understand where this place is busy but yes if the deep fried eggs came out hot and crispy would be a 5 star for sure.,4
Food and service was good. Could use a little more seasoning on the wings and meat for sandwiches. Quality food though.,5
Usually they eat there are pretty good.... However today the french fries were way overcooked and the food was greasier than normal....,3
"Stopped here for lunch, Jeff was our server and he was great! Quick service and awesome food",5
Super busy but got in right away in the bar. Burgers were great and cooked perfectly (the Elvis and the BGT). Loved the homemade fries. Kyle was on point with the service. We will be back.,5
great food and service! Wait was long but worth it. The drinks were beyond delicious!,4
Great food friendly and friendly staff. They use locally-sourced ingredients their sriracha ketchup and dressings are made in house and are delicious!  They also make their own hamburger buns Etc...  The Local Goat is a must try if you are in the area!,5
"#1) Get reservations before you go!
They are busy, but they handle it.
Food is great",5
Food was great & prices are fantastic. Make sure to make a reservation because they are busy. Food is locally sourced and they make their own ketchup and buns. Fries are wonderful!,5
"We were told to wait an hour for a table, we eventually waited almost three hours. We had to sit on bar stools to eat a tasteless meal and burnt fries. Can you imagine that! They gave tables to locals who came after us. I will never ever visit again, neither will I recommend it to another.
Such a nasty experience!",1
Everything was great except for the parking. Parking lot is not big enough for the amount of business they have.  Which in itself shows how good the place is.,5
"Would definitely recommend the Local Goat! We arrived and good ordered a delicious appetizer of fried green tomatoes (pictured), and were given a seat before our order came. When they seated us, they transferred the order, but something happened, and we were probably sitting around for 10 or 15 minutes without a waitress approaching us or taking our order, though the appetizer did come. When we flagged down Priscilla, one of the waitresses, she immediately apologized and took our order. The burgers (pimento, and Tennessee whiskey) came within the next ten minutes. Emily, the manger, also came over to apologize and comped our meal for the inconvenience, which I think shows how much they try to make sure their customers are satisfied, even when things go wrong. We'd definitely go back!",5
Great food and place to watch college and pro sports,5
"Food here was pretty good.  Our waitress Madison was great, very engaging and personable.  The food servers had an issue with the order, for some reason we had 1 order come out before our appetizer then our other 3 orders came out.  The biggest issue was, a young child SCREAMING at the top of his lungs for a while and this happened a few times.  This disturbed the entire restaurant, literally everyone in the restaurant was looking toward this kid wondering what in the world was going on....     Given the parents did absolutely nothing to stop this.  I feel like a manager should have asked them to step out, instead of disturbing the entire restaurant...",3
"The reviews were good and the parking lot was packed, even early on a very slow day when we had Dollywood to ourselves. Upon entering it actually smelled like a goat, so we were leery. But The Local Goat did not disappoint!

The cocktails were OK (margarita and mojito); not particularly special one way or another. The appetizers, though, set the stage for something spectacular! I consider myself a connoisseur of friend green tomatoes and shrimp and grits, and I ordered both. The tomatoes were some of - if not - THE best I’ve eaten, rivaling Supper!’s in Richmond. These had a little spiced sweet chutney on top. The breading was light and just right. Husband ordered fried deviled eggs, which we had never had before… wow. First, you should know that no one makes a better deviled eggs than myself. It’s what everyone asks me to bring to every event; people who claim to hate deviled eggs… love mine.  I make hundreds every year. Frankly, I don’t expect much from deviled eggs unless I make them. These.. not only was the light batter on the egg white a fun and delicious treat, the filling was just right. Husband and I agreed it was quite delicious and they could rival my own!

For entrees, he had the ribeye with salad and baked potato, and I had the shrimp and grits. I also ordered a taste of the blue cheese cole slaw since it was served with most meals so I thought I should try that twist.
- slaw: it was good, just plain cole slaw with blue cheese added. Unique and I wouldn’t turn it down, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to order it again or say you must try it
- ribeye: perfectly cooked, very good albeit somewhat fatty (perhaps that’s what happens with a local cow, so we weren’t too concerned - we only really have ribeye for our own grass fed cows to compare to)
- shrimp and grits: the piece de resistance. If you’re a bell pepper hater like myself, these are the SNG you want. I tiny bit on the too-sweet side - they might have backed off the sauce ever so slightly, to make room for the cheddar flavor of the grits (I didn’t particularly taste). The mixture of flavors and textures though, went perfectly together: wilted spinach and mushrooms included. Because we were full by the time our entrees were served, we took most of this home. It was equally good the following day and with all the flavors and texture melded together. Reheated perfectly.

Priscilla was our server and she was delightful and perfectly attentive. The smell of farm animal in reception dissipated in the dining room, but the dining room is very loud. Suggest sitting in the bar area if you have hearing or speech issues; it’s quieter.",5
Cute place. I went around 5 and the food was very quickly delivered. We had the deep fried deviled eggs and they were good and different. My steak kabobs were very tender. Crab BLT was a hit too. Friendly service. Local beers.,4
"Yes, yes , yes! Try this place! Gluten free buns and many gluten free options for me and my partner loved his meal and the choices as well. Great options, great prices and I love how fresh everything is as well as supporting the local farmer! This place is phenomenal. You can not go wrong eating here! Our waitress was incredibly sweet to top it all off.",5
"This was our first time visiting The Local Goat and we will definitely go back.

We shared the fried deviled eggs and they are just amazing.

I got the farmhouse burger with fries. That was the best burger I have had from a restaurant in a long time. And the buns....oh my!

My husband got the smokehouse burger and he was pleased but the burger itself needed a little more seasoning for his taste. The onion rings he ordered were out of this world amazing.

Now to the sauces - the homemade ketchup, wow. This is better than anything you can buy from the grocery store. The ranch - fantastic! Anything would taste amazing dipped in that ranch.",5
I love this restaurant.  Can be up to a 2 hour wait but totally worth it!!  The deep fried deviled eggs are beyond good and the burgers are really big and delicious!!,5
"Was excited to try, drinks were water down, burgers buns were way to big, couldn’t taste the meat. Daughter did not even eat her nachos and server didn’t offer to get something else. Kinda pricey",2
"Try the deep fried deviled eggs. So weird, but so good! ❤️",5
"We've been super excited about trying the food here after moving here locally and seeing all the great reviews. Porkchop was super yummy, but the ribeye we ordered came to us too dry and overcooked. Very disappointing, especially when we were expecting a juicy medium-rare and received a sad piece of leather. The fried deviled eggs were okay, but instead of a panko batter it might taste better with a breading that was crunchier to combat the soft egg.",3
Best reataurant in pigeon forge! This is the best value in town.i had an amazing burger and the fried green tomatoes are to die for! Service was spectacular! I waited one hour for my tavbe and would wait 2 hrs to come again! If you don't stop here you are missing out,5
Delightful dining experience. Fantastic food and desserts. Staff is friendly and hardworking.  Menu has many choices. Restaurant has plenty of seating. This is a must eat at spot. Good job folk's,5
Good food Robert was hour server great job,5
"Visiting the area for a bit and thought we'd hit up The Local Goat for a dinner.

We were seated promptly at a nice sized booth and quickly greeted by our server for our drink ordered.  No issues with sweet tea and root beer, so it's on to the deep fried deviled eggs as an appetizer.  I am a pretty big fan of deviled eggs and was eager to get my pudgy little fingers on these things.  They came out super quickly and were delicious.

For our entrees, I ordered the BGT Burger (with onion rings) while my wife ordered the Smokehouse Burger (with fries).  These did NOT come out as quickly as the eggs which was extremely disappointing because my burger was cooked well-done when I asked for it to be medium...so I had to wait even longer for them to make a new one.  When it finally came to me, it was a good tasting burger, but unfortunately, not worth the wait.  It's a massive tower of a burger, which makes it even more disappointing that it didn't taste as good as it looked.  My wife enjoyed her Smokehouse Burger and it was cooked correctly as well.

Now the fries and onion rings were delicious...but sadly my burger came up short.

Oh well. Overall it was a good visit with a nice friendly staff.",3
"The prices are good for the touristy area. Expect to pay $25-30 for an aged steak and two delicious sides. For the price, you cannot beat the quality. Their ingredients are sourced locally and of high quality. The deviled eggs were savory and the fried green tomatoes with goat cheese were a delightful twist on a classic. Portion sizes are plentiful and the food was presented without the tell-tale hot plates which are indicative of food sitting under a hot lamp. The waitstaff are attentive and friendly. While being tourists, we usually don't eat at the same place twice, we were so impressed we have decided that will eat here again.",5
"All of the reviews are correct...  This place is amazing!  Not one negative.  It's Clean, friendly, quick service, and TASTY!",5
We had appetizers and really enjoyed them.,5
"Extremely well priced for the location. Reservations are easy to get on short notice. The atmosphere is comfortable. The cheese fondue is a great choice if you're unsure about an appetizer. I dropped a star because the lamb on my burger had practically no flavor. Service was exceptionally good. It wasn't overwhelmingly loud, despite going at a popular time. I feel like they could have done better seasoning & preparing their meat. I expected better food quality, but for the price it makes sense.",4
"Good food.  Nice atmosphere.   Decent portions.  Good sauces, all housemade.  A little pricey.",4
"Great food! Fondue appetizer was amazing, smokehouse burger, and drinks!",5
"This place is awesome. The food is local sourced and truly tastes fresh. Our waiter Jonathan M was fantastic, he took his time to explain the premise of the restaurant and make sure we understood what we were ordering. He never let our drinks get low and was prompt with the check. If you're looking for good food and Better service stop here.",5
"Went on Mothers Day. Never were my Mom and I told Happy Mothers Day. Food was good nothing spectacular. Prices I feel were high for portion size. No dinner rolls or bread with meals. Our waitress had  no personality at all, making it not a great experience. Sat at the back of the restaurant in a corner when there were plenty of open tables up front. Not sure if we will be back. Parking lot is awful. Not many handicap spots making it very difficult for someone who has trouble walking to walk up that incline.",3
"Fresh local food, non GMO, antibiotics, steroids, or high fructose corn syrup. Food and service was really good. Good cheesecake.",5
The food and customer service is AMAZING.,5
"We had a wonderful experience at Local Goat!  The food was amazing!  Everything was made from scratch, including fresh ground in house burger, and the bun it was on! I love finding great locally owned restaurants, and that's exactly what this place is.",5
"Good portions, nice atmosphere, decent prices,and excellent tasting food.",5
Best place hands down! This was our first time here and not the last! Everything was amazing! Every single person on staff that we encountered was AMAZING so....must have great management! Our server was Jeremy P and he went above and beyond! The best server we have had anywhere!,5
"Our food was amazing! One of the best burgers I’ve had. Hubby had the shrimp n grits, they were delicious as well.

Our server was busy with a big party, but he paid us equal attention, was very attentive and just a very friendly guy.

It’s always super busy, so make sure to make reservations a day or so in advance, otherwise you’ll wait for an hour or longer.",5
I had the best portobello burger of my life here - I didn't miss the beef one bit. It was that good. Bravo guys,5
"Nice selection of food, good variety of beer, wine and cocktails to choose from. Good for a large group. Reservations are recommended. Cheerful staff.",4
"Food and service were great, and prices reasonable for a touristy area.",5
"Wow, what a great place. Owners have done there homework at this place, fresh grass feed beef, homemade sauses, buns freshly made...really did there homework for a great restaurant.  I am impressed.  I enjoyed my food.",5
Had a wonderful dinner at the Local Goat. I’ve been many times and everything I order is just spectacular. All the ingredients are fresh and bought local or made in house. I would recommend the steak kabobs. By far my favorite restaurant in the Pigeon Forge area,5
First time trying it  it was busy but no problem but we ordered the rack of ribs they were dry and looked and tasted like they had been cooked in a crock pot  all day wasn't worth the money on them and they tried charging us for two orders of chicken strips and fries  luckily I look at the recipet before I pay and they took that off dont know if I will try it again maybe the steaks might be better than the  ribs because they cant cook ribs,3
"The food was amazing!! We had the Ahi Tuna app, Salmon and pork chop loin entree (Both amazing) Staff was very friendly and attentive(Can't remember our server's name, but he was great and all his recommendations were spot on).  We had a great experience and will return!!",5
"We tried the fried green tomatoes, ahi tuna, and fried deviled egg appetizers. Let me tell you this was an experience. Every bite had flavor,  texture,  and a surprise in store. If you're visiting this part of the country you'll want to add this place to your MUST HAVES list. Did I mention the crab cake burger? 😍😍😍😍",5
"We tried it but comparing it to cracker Barrel, there's no comparison. At the goat, dry pork chop. Never had a dry one at the barrel. For two of us at the goat, $58. At the barrel never above$35.",2
We had a wonderful time. The server explained to us the menu. We tried the fried green tomatoes. Omg they were delicious! I had a salad with grilled salmon. My husband had chicken wings & fries. He wasn't crazy about the fries but everything else was great. Serve was excellent!!!,5
This place was a amazing experience. Staff super friendly knowledgeable about their menu. Prices are excellent and the wait wasn't that bad. Food was amazing but unfortunately I didn't take any photos 😕,5
"It was an awesome dining experience. The parking lot was full, but they still seated us in 10 minutes. Our server was great. Food came out in 10 to 15 minutes and was spot on. Go with one of their signature burgers you won't be disappointed.",5
Local Goat is the encounter of a modern pub ambiance with a good restaurant. A little bit  pricey but is a great place for one special night.,5
Delicious! Service was excellent as well.,5
"We had burgers and they were just ok. The meat patty was small, fat and dry. Tall burgers look good but never taste great.
Let make burger that are wider not taller!",3
Good food. I found out that i love deep fried deviled eggs.,5
"The kids meals are a big portion for only $5. Our kids loved their cheeseburgers, chicken tenders, grilled cheese & hot dogs.
I went out on a limb & tried The Elvis burger with smoked bacon, peanut butter & fried banana. The banana & peanut butter were very mild. The bacon, burger & bun were phenomenal!
We also tried the gluten free option on the Smokehouse burger. A-MA-ZING!!! The gluten free bun is house made & delicious. Smoked gouda cheese, BBQ sauce, caramelized onions & smoked bacon... where can you go wrong?!
If you're not in the mood for fries, we highly recommend the whipped sweet potatoes. It's like dessert. So yummy!",5
"My wife and I have visited the Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge area for many years. We have passed by this restraunt and thought it looked interesting and finally decided to try it. We were very glad we did! First off, since this is in the foothills of the Smokey Mountians, make sure your parking brake is in good order and you know how to operate it. The parking lot is pretty steep and you will need to set your parking brake. We arrived around 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon. They were already busy, but we did not have to wait. The dining area is nice with brown, black and gray accents on the wall. There is a lot of seating areas. I saw large groups so they are able to accommodate that if needed. Our waitress was very friendly and prompt. She said they source most of their ingredients from local farms and makeots of other items from scratch. We ordered the fried green tomatoes to start. They were fantastic; topped with goat cheese, bacon jam and caramelized onions. My wife ordered the Black and Blue burger. She said it was very good. The burgers are large, especially after they add the stuff that makes your burger what it is. Hers had creamy blue cheese, fried onions, thick bacon and a blackening seasoning. I did not want a burger so I went for the Fettuccine Rocco. Wow was it good! Probably the tastiest I have ever had. It was a large bowl of pasta with a large quantity of great ingredients such as spinach, wood grilled chicken, bacon, mushrooms, onions tomatoes and a fantastic sauce. If you want something different, give it a try!",5
"Great food, service and prices!",5
The Ribeye was just okay. Nothing like Connor's steak house on Turkey creek.,3
Amazing food😍,5
"One of the main reasons I like visiting Sevierville is the food. Local Goat has to be one of the BEST places to eat in town. All the appetizers are wonderful, the burgers are perfect, and the customer experience is great. I will say that if you go at a peak time, it can get pretty cramped in there. So if you are not comfortable being crammed into places, try to come at an off time.",5
"Super popular restaurant for a good reason.  The food and atmosphere are great. Menu has a good selection. Seating is comfortable and not to close to other diners. I made a reservation early in the week and the day I arrived I was seated with 8 minutes from the time I checked in.  Our waitress left something to be desired is the only negative i can offer. My group remained thirsty. Condiments, salt and pepper on the table would have been nice. But I will be back for the quality of food.",5
"One of the best places I have ever eaten at. Food is amazing service was great. Huge plates, almost everything is home made. Definitely makes a difference!",5
excellent food and service! Highly recommend this place!,5
Excellent food and top notch service!,5
I'm gluten intolerant and have really bad reactions. This was an amazing burger! The gluten free bread was delicious! They do have a separate gluten free menu as well. I forgot our severs name but he was so nice. Everything was timely and the place was clean!,5
Excellent service and food was great,5
Wow!!! Amazing food and staff!! I wish this wasn’t our last day because we would of eaten there every day! It was that good!!,5
"The “median well” ribeye came to the table rare. The mixed drink tasted like soured pineapple juice was used. Other than that the waiter was nice and the ribs were wonderful. Too
many better places to eat in PF- not the wait.",3
Really good food. Beth was our server. Good quality good. Make reservations a couple days ahead,5
"This was a great find in Pigeon Forge!
The food was very good, and tge choices were vast. It covered all the spectrum for my family, and was able to be under budget for what we had planned. We will definitely be back!",4
"We went on a monday evening, our wait for a table was less than 20 minutes. Our server was amazing and very attentive on what I considered a busy night. He shared that this was not to busy considering January is their slowest month 😯. The hubs ordered the lamb burger, I snagged a bite and it was delish! I ordered shrimp and grits, omg, my first time ever having and it was so good!  I also got the irish snowstorm, not only pretty to look at but it was yummy as well! Our son order the teriyaki kabobs also delish. We also enjoyed the deep fried deviled eggs( deep. Fried. Deviled eggs. ). We will definitely be coming back the next time we are in the area. Highly recommend.  Even if you have a wait time. It's worth it.",5
"There was a wait but it was quicker than expected to be seated.  If your looking for authentic southern fried green tomatoes look somewhere else.  They're just prepared different before they add everything else.  I had the Farmhouse burger with goat cheese instead of american.  Their buns are huge 2x's lgr than the meat which I asked for medium and came well and dry.  Not crazy about eating mostly bread. The fried egg was over easy and squishing the bun down broke it and ran everywhere.  Everytime I tried to bite into the overly tall burger the egg would slip cause the top half to slide.   Could not keep the burger together.  It was a huge mess and embarrassing to eat.  Their homemade fries are limp and nothing special and you get a lot.  My husband had the Whiskey Glazed burger and it was dry, he added steak sauce and it helped.  Didn't care for his fries either.  For what we paid with the appetizer and all to say we were disappointed would be an understatement.",1
"We love this place it is our stop at least once every trip! Food match the prices, great tasting food! Waiters have always treated us great.",5
The fried deviled eggs were different but delicious. There were three of us and we each got different burgers which all 3 were delicious.,5
"Our experience wasn’t great.  we ordered  our hamburgers medium to medium well. And when we received them they were way over done. The out side was even a little burned.
It was busy so we did not send them back
The waiter did notice we weren’t eating  them and he also acknowledged they were over cooked. And said they didn’t usually come out like that.
He did offer us a free dessert.
Even if they had not been over cooked, it seemed like just a average hamburger nothing special.
Maybe we just ordered wrong,  but we were disappointed considering the reviews and how busy the always are.

To the bright side the service was good. The food came out in a timely manage",2
"This was hands down the best meal we had in Pigeon Forge during our week here.  The burgers were amazing, the fries were perfect, the beer was cold, and our server, Dillon, was attentive and on top of everything we needed.  I wish our cabin was closer because it’s an every meal type place.  Highly, highly recommend.",5
I've never left a review but it felt necessary because this was the most over priced and worst food I've ever had in my life. I do not say that lightly. DO NOT EAT HERE!!! You will regret it!,1
"Simply amazing that this restaurant has everything is made in house, and uses local sourced food for its menu, our server(Bella) was very attentive and took great care of us as well as telling us the high points of the menu, our Ribeye steaks were cooked exactly the way we like them( medium rare) and the cheesecake with a strawberry compote was delicious. A must stop and try cause there is something for everyone on the menu.",5
Good place to eat need get there early stays pack,5
Great food! Fast service.,5
"If I could give more stars for this I would! The food was incredible, our waiter Dillon was extremely kind and had great recommendations. The atmosphere was great. This will be a new staple in our visits, I can't imagine visiting Pigeon Forge without visiting The Local Goat anymore.",5
Very good food!!  We had burgers and fish & chips and all was great.  We will be back!,5
It had been a long time since I had such great tasting food along with amazing service by Janice. I left her a 25% tip that is how good she was.,5
Best restaurant in PF by far!! Always great! Worth the wait!! Great family run business. Love this place!!,5
Fantastic! Ribs were fall off the bone good and the steak was perfect. The homemade fries are great too!  Make a reservation just to make sure you get in!,5
Everything we hoped it would be and more. We chose Local Goat for my birthday dinner after reading reviews and checking out the menu online. The fried deviled eggs were amazing! We ended up going back a second night during our stay. We can't wait to visit again in the future.,5
One of our favorites! Make reservations - it's popular - but well worth the wait. Food is excellent and service is fantastic!,5
"Well worth the wait, food was great. Met a nice couple outside while waiting for our table.",5
From the unique food options to normal food options; whatever you get it will be delicious. In addition 99% of the food is from scratch and is sourced locally. Can’t wait to go back,5
"Great food, fast service even with being packed. Waitress was very good!!",5
"Great food and service. I loved that they did not use styrofoam for leftovers. That's hard to find in the area. Sustainable, fantastic place!",5
The food was GREAT!! My kids can be quite critical when it comes to food and they loved their meals. Gerard our server was very friendly and attentive. We will definitely visit again!,5
"I tried their chicken sandwich which had ham on it, too. It was delicious and such a huge sandwich! Unfortunately I could only eat half of it before I was full. It was one of the best sandwiches I ever had! They also had really good fries and ketchup. Their ketchup had a little ""kick"" to it which made it so good. If you ever visit this area, I highly recommend.",5
This was one of our favorites during our trip. I got the Hawaiian steak. It was delicious. The fried deviled eggs are a must try. So many amazing choices to pick from. A must when visiting!,5
THE best place to eat in the area. Usually long waits but always worth it,5
"Son and I agreed best burgers we ever had. Gluten-free buns. Eclectic drinks. Upscalish atmosphere. Fine bar. Fun mountain coaster, tubing...next door.",5
"Almost two hour wait to be seated, but once in there, service was quick and food came out fast. Great waitress and delicious food.",5
Made a reservation early afternoon (~5 pm)  for late evening (8:15 pm earliest available) and showed up for our reservation to a dark and empty restaurant……,1
"RUDE MANAGER.   NEVER AGAIN 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
No help needed.  Email from Mgr. Just will not be back and will spend my money elsewhere.  Now they wanna help. SMH",1
"Overall good food. Was a little underwhelmed by the fried deviled eggs. The Elvis burger is a must if you’re a peanut butter fan, like me. My husband ordered wings and loved them. Reasonable prices. Wait time was a little long at 3 pm. Overall, would return.",4
"Fried deviled eggs, beer cheese, 4 hamburgers chicken salad amounts to a fine delicious family meal.",5
"Loved my meal
Boneless pork chop",4
"5 stars doesn't do the Local Goat justice. The food was absolutely delicious not one complaint. Madison was the best, her recommendations were perfect. Thank you to the chefs, the owner and everyone else involved with the Local Goat",5
"Have good food, but service was a bit lacking.

The server did not know what beer was on tap and did not feel the need to find out (I asked if they had any apple ales on tap and was told, ""we can change what is on tap hourly, so I don't know what we have now."").  Then the server gave me the wrong salad, which turned out fine because it was good.

The daughter said her mac & cheese she had, other than Grandma's.",3
"Awesome drinks, very busy but food was excellent",5
"Very enjoyable. We had reservations. But were seated 25 minutes early.

Our server, Elijah, was super. He was very attentive even though they were on the busy side.

We enjoyed our meals...from ribeye...ribs and salmon.

Looking forward in returning soon.",5
"Best food and best service, prices were right to",5
They make a pretty good burger!,5
"Excellent food, beer selection and great service. Jeff was great as a server, answered all questions and very helpful. The burger was amazing, definitely the best I've had. I would recommend this place to everyone, get there early, it gets packed fast.",5
This is the best place to eat at in Pigeon Forge! Everything was freshly made! I can't wait to come back and visit!,5
this is the only good place in this town. everywhere is so freaky and we finally found some sense of normalcy at local goat. food and service was amazing!,5
"Good place to eat,everything was delicious",5
Great food Great waiter but expensive for what you get but it is a tourist spot,4
Appetizers were delicious!! Absolutely get the fried green tomatoes and the shrimp. Only 4 stars because entrees and service were not great.,4
"The food was good, kind of pricey, a little overrated in my opinion, lots of other places in Pigeon Forge I would personally prefer, the food was by no means bad, it was very good, but not what I expected.",4
Unique and tastey entrees plus the drinks and desserts are off the hook,5
VERY VERY VERY YUMMY PLACE!! We went back two days in a row because their food and service was so good!! Highly recommend this place!!,5
"They are all locally sourced with a lot of items being handmade, like mayo and ketchup. It's absolutely amazing!!",5
Rarely do I post a bad review...started with the bartender (with a beard).  He clearly had an attitude.  I asked him if the jalapeno margarita was good...gave me some smart comment.  Come to find out other staff members agree.  Next is the barbeque shrimp (see the picture).  Soaked in grease (was told it was butter).  Not good.  The reason for 3 stars is that the salmon and tuna was average.  Won't be back.,3
Oooo the food is fantastic ..,5
"Second time there... had to wait for 20 minutes to get in... Nachos were amazing..
Service was good.... out of Onion Rings  😕 worth the trip if your in the naborhood...",4
My boyfriend and I had an amazing meal and the service was great!!! Will be coming back.,5
"Food was excellent. Customer service, our server ""Olya"" treated us like royalty.  Salmon was good,  lamb burger was good.",4
"Really an unbelievably good meal! We love Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, but many of the restaurants there lack creativity and that fine-dining level of cuisine. Local Goat manages to pull that off without coming across at all stuffy or pretentious, just delicious, creative good and excellent service. The ribs were truly the best I've ever had in my life! Do not miss!!",5
"Our food was so delicious and our server was kind, attentive, friendly and my kids loved her! We will definitely be back next time we are in town.",5
TN Whiskey Glazed Burger was excellent. Cheesy grits and whipped sweet potatoes were delicious.,5
"My wife and I ate lunch here on our way out of town. Everything is made on site and sourced locally. Our server, Jennifer S, was delightful, upbeat, and very attentive. She suggested the fried green tomatoes, which were some of the best I've had. The burgers were great too. We will definitely return next time we're in Pigeon Forge.",5
Thankful they were open until 11 as we were late getting to dinner and the first restaurant we went to had just closed at 9. Teriyaki kabobs and fish and chips were good.  Steak nachos were good as well. It was late so a few of our group of 7 split plates and that worked out well. Finished with a tasty lava cake.,5
Everything was delicious and the staff were very pleasant. I would eat there every day if I could.,5
We are at this place several times when we were there a few years ago.  It is amazing!  Try the deep fried deviled eggs!  Can’t wait to get back down to Gaitlinburg.  Will definitely go there again!,5
"Great food and price, skip the line, check in online",5
Amazing!! And the deep fried deviled eggs are a must!!,5
This place is so good!!  I cannot even tell you in words. Just mmmmmmmmmm. Go try it. If there is a wait. It's worth it. I promise. And so much beer to try!!!!!,5
Loved the place..!! Very good food. I am a vegetarian and in the menu I found a pasta which I could convert it to vegetarian option.,5
Great Food and Excellent service.,5
Good food. Friendly staff. Nice environment. Go early to avoid a wait.,5
The meal was delicious at least mine was lol. Very decent place food was awesome. May not be every one's cup of tea as they say. Has lots of variety.,5
"This will be a go-to on any future trips to the Smoky Mountains for sure! The friendliest staff and management I have ever encountered as well as DELICIOUS from-scratch food.
Thank you to our server Maria and the managers (didn't catch your names) for your kindness and understanding when one of our littles got sick. I was feeling panicked and stressed and you changed all of that by making the transition seamless to a new table. The toddler is fine, and my mental health is fine, too, thanks to this experience.
I will recommend this establishment to anybody I hear planning a trip to this area.",5
"Great place to eat in Pigeon Forge. Local, sustainable, incredible staff, great atmosphere. Always busy for a reason. Highly, highly recommend!",5
Great food and service. Very much enjoyed.    Ribeye.  So delicious,5
"I love this place, as a local I tell many people about it and bring friends and family often as I can get in...
I went today and ordered my favorite BLT Crab cake burger.
I was surprised today as normally there are lumps of real crab that are wonderful. Today its was mushy and not the norm.
When I asked the server if they
changed it, he said nope it's that same as always. I told him I eat this often and this was mush rather
than actual lumps he got a bit testy as if I was lieing.
I still still enjoy eating here and the food is wonderful...however,  I can say I do know the difference between a lump and Mush...
I truly hope that they go back to how it was...",4
Yummy food. Nice place.,5
"Homemade dressings and burger buns!!!, large portions.  Great happy hour and drink prices.  I'm clearly a fan of this place.",5
"Should be in Nashville; not Pidgeon Forge. In the middle of commercial excess and neon glitz, there is a restaurant that makes all its own sauces and stays farm to table.",5
"I actually love love love this restaurant. I visited 4 years ago shortly after they opened and fell hard for the place. Now, fortunately for them, the place is so busy, the service and food were not as good as my first visit. I will still visit again the next time I'm in Gatlinburg/PF and will recommend it to others.",4
"Clean, beautiful restaurant. We came about 45 minutes before closing, and I can tell you that the employees are all very kind and clean this place WELL. Nooks and crannies, they take apart the booths and move them and thoroughly clean, everything.
Service was perfect! Food was great. The fries are amazing, steaks are tender, and if you’ve never tried their in-house ketchup it’s sooo good! Many of their foods are local and made in-house.
Such a great atmosphere and business! Please open a restaurant in [south] Louisiana! You’d make a killing for sure",5
The food here is phenomenal!!!! Olga was our server and she was great. Provided some great suggestions and told us a little more about the restaurant. I had the steak and the flavor was just out of this world. My wife had the burger with the fried egg on it and that was really good as well. The fries here are a must have!!!! Will be back here everytime we visit Pigeon Forge!!,5
"I was excited to eat here while visiting due to all the great reviews it had recieved. I got the grilled chicken sandwich because it sounded good. It was decent, not what I excepted though from reviews I had read. The fries tasted like they had been sitting a bit, but the portions were adequate.",3
Delicious burgers and fries,5
This is one of the best places I have eaten at food and staff are awesome very friendly we had to wait a while but it was well worth it,5
Steak overly seasoned. Tried to make reservations for Saturday night at like noon Saturday... first available Sunday at 345. Salads were awesome.,2
"Amazing food and service! It was a very crowded Saturday night,  so we made reservations earlier that day (2-3 hours ahead of time). Our table was ready right on time, which is unheard of considering all the people waiting. The server was prompt and friendly. The food was amazing and service was fast. The beer flight did not disappoint,  and the cheese fondue was large and refillable! I had the shrimp and grits. Would highly recommend. My picky daughter got the Maui chicken and ate all of it. It was the best dining experience of our entire trip.",5
"Great place to eat. I always try to eat at locally owned places while on vacation and this place was a MUST! We had the fried deviled eggs and the pimento burger with their homemade fries. They make all of their stuff homemade daily (including their ketchup) and they get it from local places as well. Makes it taste that much better!

The only thing I was disappointed in is they didn’t have a goat as a mascot outside 😅.",5
We came here because I liked the name and this place had amazing reviews. Let me say the food was delicious and our server Jenni was amazing. She went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our experience!,5
"This place is amazing! Our server Jenny was the best. She was kind and answered all of our questions. If you go, ask for her and tip generously! She's excellent!",5
I mean seriously! Best place in PF or Gatlinburg to get food! Our waiter was probably the nicest person I’ve ever met! The food? AMAZING! I got ribs that literally just melted in my mouth. You could cut it with a plastic fork! The cheese grits were best I’ve had in Tennessee. My wife had the steak with Mac and cheese and she didn’t want it to end! We will make the 14 hour trip just to eat here!,5
Got a to go order and they forgot half our food! Way overpriced for  the portion. $8 creme brulee with seasonal berries.,1
"4 stars because the food was good and the service was, too. I used to train servers and ours did everything I hope for when at a restaurant except she lingered at the table telling us all about herself. We are pretty personable, but she lingered too long and we now know more than necessary about her. She was sweet, but this was a date. Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars.
Also, idk why there's a big fuss and always a huge crowd. We could take it or leave it. It wasn't anything exceptional.  IMO",4
"Great food, very good service",5
Oh My Goodness!!! The food was WONDERFUL! The service was OUTSTANDING!!! A DEFINITE MUST IF GOING OUT FOR A GREAT DINNER!!!,5
I love the Local Goat. Amazing food and service.,5
"This place is always amazing and definitely worth the wait if you decide to go last minute, though they are one of the few places that take reservations around town. There are several reasons it's always packed and in a wait. Service is always above and beyond. Food is always delicious and on point every time. Cannot praise the Local Goat enough. If you like a little drank the Buckberry Old Fashioned is quite tasty. The ribs here are phenomenal and you simply have to try the deep fried deviled eggs at least once. Very casual though good for a date night too.",5
"Amazing service, but we did wait 75 minutes. They were out of the Chocolate Peanut butter desert and being that there are 2 Lodge cast iron factory stores in the area, I feel they could benefit from using for the steaks. The char takes away from the quality of the meat. That being said I was highly impressed and would recommend to anyone coming to visit. The parking situation is atrocious.",4
"The wait was 45 minutes but the food and service was well worth it.  We had a party of 10 and tried all of the appetizers.  Piquillo peppers were in season and they were wonderful.  Our server was awesome, she got a 20 percent tip and well worth it.",5
Very good food and service. The cheese appetizer was the BEST.,5
Omg a must stop the flavor of the food was awesome,5
This is one of the best restaurants in Pigeon Forge. The food is top notch and the staff is very friendly. Highly recommend! I got the ahi tuna burger cooked rare and it was perfect!,5
Our lunch was so amazing wecame back for dinner.,5
"Thought the menu choices were good with a wide healthy variety although the chicken options leaned a little heavily toward teriyaki. I love teriyaki so that's not a bad thing to me. 😁
TIP: Don't let the parking lot looking full scare you away. It appeared full as we pulled in but walked right into our seats (party of 4).
One little nitpick- the ketchup that comes with the meal is flavored with sriracha and waiter didn't mention it until I asked. Atmosphere was relaxed and food service was average speed for this genre. Would probably go back on another trip.",4
"Crazy Good!! All Fresh, All made in house sauces.  Great selection, Great service. Even my picky a** kids loved it. It made the ""must do"" list for our next vacation in the smokies!",5
"Shrimp n grits were good, ribs were good. Server was good.",3
"Great food, great atmosphere, would definitely come back again! Kids ordered cheeseburgers and requested gluten free bun w/o problems. I ordered black & blue burger - best burger I've had in a LONG time. Ketchups is spicy, which was a pleasant surprise! Husband ordered 10oz sirloin with salad and broccoli and he too really enjoyed the meal. The only downside is the wait, 35-45 min, but we talked to some locals while waiting and apparently this is normal all day, every day of the week. Parking is tough, so be prepared to fight for a spot. Despite this, highly recommend!!",5
Not bad. Glad to have something different. A little on the pricey side. Excellent service.,4
"Had a BBQ chicken sandwich, very good. Great service and friendly wait staff. Get a reservation or expect a wait.",5
"One of the best restaurants we've been to. Everyone at the table (picky eaters, and food critics too) loved their meals!
Our table ordered the sirloin with caramelized onion whipped potatoes and salad, farmhouse burgers and fries, a portobello burger and an appetizer of fried deviled eggs. Everything was so good and so fresh.
Decently priced for the quality of the meal.   Will definitely return",5
"Was told a hour, waited 80, went to hostess stand and was told another 20. After that twenty was told another 20.... (no coment)  once we finally we sat we ordered drinks, dinner it started good.  Ordered steak med, came out almost rare.  Ordered burger well done came out medium. Never got asked if I wanted another beer. Food was OK I don't think it's worth the hype.",3
Wonderful place to eat. Staff very friendly and the food was AWESOME! Didn't have to wait long and the food was HOT!,5
Service was great food was ok . best part of the dinner was the caramelized onion mash potatoes... Other then that it was nothing real special . went with a party of 5 and everyone has the same feelings about the food . 3.5 stars .,3
Amazing food and excellent service! The fried deviled eggs were a surprise and delight. The onion rings were almost as big as the dinner plate. I had the shrimp and grits and they were delish! Don't miss this gem of a restaurant if you are in the area.,5
"Everything about our visit here was excellent.  While alot of the dishes sound familiar, they are all executed with a little bit of a twist.  Our server, Trevor, was friendly and informative and took the time to male sure we were happy throughout our entire visit.  The tuna was excellent, ribs fantastic, crab cake BLT amazing, and the TN Whiskey burger was pretty good too(ordered it medium and got it well so it was a little dry)

We had a peanut butter pie, a lava cake, and a bread pudding g for dessert.  The bread pudding and peanut butter pie are big enough to be shared by at least 2 people.

Given how busy the restaurant was we were pleased with both the speed and quality of service.",5
"Place is very good.  Good service, good food,  good drinks.  Always busy and parking is a little scarce at times but I don't hesitate to recommend.",5
"Delicious food, and they use local meats...our waiter was awesome as well!",5
"The menu, service & food were all great!  Will definitely return!",5
Staff were very nice. Gave advice on dishes...due to the fact it was our first visit. Food came to table looking great on the plate and hot!!! Thank you for making this a pleasant experience.,5
"Fabulous food, friendly fast service and reasonable priced.  Had a full rack of ribs to share and was more than enough!  Want to go back soon!!!",5
We loved it.  Beer was really good and a large variety on tap.,5
"Great food and service. Only draw back was , why make. Reservation when you still have to wait another 40 minutes to get seated",5
"We went one day for lunch and it was so good we went back the next day, too! We tried several different menu items and each one was delicious. The burger meat is ground in house from whole roasts. The tuna steaks are sashimi grade tuna. The deep fried deviled eggs were amazing. Everything from dressing to buns are made in house.",5
"I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  This place was just ok.  Nothing special.  We waited over 1 hour for a table and the food was just OK.  Nachos, needed help.  Salads, very small for the price, I mean come on, how cheap it lettuce.  Burgers, ok.  I would definately not wait to be sitted at this place again.  Too many other GOOD restaurants in the area that have better food.  Not impressed.  Sorry",1
"This was our favorite place we ate at in Pigeon Forge! The food was good, the drinks were good, and the service was great! We expected a long wait when we arrived since the parking lot was so busy, but the wait was only 30 minutes, not bad at all. We got the Hawaiian ribeye and the coconut shrimp, both were large serving sizes and tasted delicious. The creme brulee was great for dessert!",5
Delicious food - we tried multiple menu selections and every single thing was amazing! We enjoyed it so much that we returned a second time during our trip. Can't wait to come back again!,5
"Great restaurant, but a bit priceyyyyy!",5
"We went the the Local Goat on December 5, 2019.
The hotel we were staying (the Clarion,  good stay and clean with free breakfast) Suggested we eat there.
We were sat immediately and our waiter arrived....I strained my neck...
A nearly 7' tall Gentle Ben was there to take our order.
Ben took care of us and was very helpful with the menu. He has a great personality.
The food:
She ordered the salmon and I had the ribeye (NOT the Hawaiian).
the steak was cooked to perfection but was not as tender as I hoped considering it was supposed to be aged for 28 days.
It had a good flavor however.
The baked potato was the kind with salt on the skin...the best.
For the side salad, I had blue cheese dressing. The blue cheese was not aged enough to have a decent blue cheese flavor...added more crumbles and salt...a bit better.
The salmon...was very good as well, however after eating a piece of my steak she was a bit jealous.
I will definitely be going back to the Local Goat next time I am town and if Ben is still there I will request him...
If not...good luck in your career!",4
"Excellent food, staff was very friendly",5
Fantastic farm to table restaurant.  The sweet potatoes were exceptional.,5
"If your taste runs toward gourmet they have several good choices. Several interesting appetizers like deep fried deviled eggs. Burgers were good but didn't justify the price. The ""hand cut fries"" were similar to Steak-n-Shake but not as good. Our party was 4 of 7 said they wouldn't return. Definitely be aware of cost.",3
"Not what it's cracked up to be,not worth the wait.",2
"It's hard to find a place that checks all the boxes. Great food great service and a great price! The place is packed to the brim! The 45 minute wait was more than worth it!

Highly recommend the fried deviled eggs. The sriracha honey wings were also very good!

Worth every penny!",5
Was very good food.,5
Pretty good overall. Server was awesome. Glad they did reservations.,4
"I highly recommend this place.  You will need a reservation because it's always packed.  I had the shrimp and grits which was awesome but made in a different way,  the shrimps had a sweet sauce with mushrooms.  The others had fish and chips and hai tuna in soy sauce.  Also coconut shrimp.  EVERYTHING WAS EXCELLENT,  except for the Cole slaw which was SPICY!! I love Cole slaw and this was disappointing.  It had no sauce. The hamburgers are really big.",4
Fried green Tomatoes were amazing! Service was very pleasant. And burgers are huge! Will definitely be coming back next time.e we are down here.,5
Great food. Good service. The deep fried deviled eggs were surprisingly good.,5
Decent food and good service.,4
The food thar we ordered was delicious.... Ran out of a food staple for each person in our group. Thought this was highly unusual for a 4 pm arrival. Great experience over all.,5
It was awesome all though i recommend calling in ahead as they are always extremely busy but service food and drinks are all amazing!!!,5
The food was FANTASTIC!   The service was great. Our waiter Kyle was great!   Make this a stop in your visit to Pigeon Forge!,5
Awesome food and exceptional service! Reasonably priced and everything was very fresh!,5
"Excellent food and friendly, fast and attentive staff. Will go back again",5
Great ambience. Ben was an excellent server. Steak salad was delicious. Huge burgers. Great portion size. Tried the deep fried deviled eggs. Will be back!,5
I loved this place! The food and atmosphere were great and the food was locally sourced. They also have gluten free options for those who need it.,5
The food was really just amazing and the customer service was excellent! I would drive back down from Michigan just to enjoy the experience again.,5
Excellent food and service was ok,5
"Based on the raving reviews, we made reservations here. I love that a lot of the ingredients are local. The service was fantastic, even though the place was packed!! We felt like the food was overrated though. Our burgers were just OK. We went back again, to give it a second shot. I had the Maui Chicken & my husband got the Ahi Tuna Steak this time. Both were mediocre meals. Better than a fastfood place, but for the price, it wasn't worth it, in our opinion.",3
Fantastic burger selection and tasty food! Ask for Yuri!,5
"I cannot begin to explain my love for this place. We live five hours away, but go to Gatlinburg for vacation frequently. We went to Gatlinburg to get married and chose Local Goat, our favorite, for our after wedding meal. We eloped, but had a gorgeous ceremony. We went in our wedding outfits after traveling all day and then getting married. The staff treated us so special. They were so kind. This is not new. We chose Local Goat because the staff is always great and the food and drinks are spectacular. Look, even their French fries are somehow special and more delicious than other fries. Anyway, they congratulated us and treated us to a shared dessert on the house (we chose creme brûlée and it was divine). It was so romantic. I seriously love this place. I wish we lived close enough to become regulars!",5
The food here was great! They make most things there. They even make their own ketchup.  The parking lot was packed everytime we drove by. I would recommend reservations.,5
"Heard great reviews, but it was quite mediocre. Had to send my $25 meal back because it was cold. Probably will not revisit.",2
"Great food, servers are awesome, make a reservation, they are usually on a 2 hour wait by 430 pm, Farmhouse burger, onion rings, and peanut butter pie are my favorites",5
"Outstanding unique flavors snd traditional favorites. They take reservations. Having as group over 10 required separate seatIng  areas, and they helped us be adjacent to each other. Great service!",5
This restaurant 😍🤤🤤🤤 they have the BEST burgers!,5
"Then local goat is great, we always make sure to stop in each time we go to Tennessee. Their steaks are great, and the deep fried devil eggs are the bomb. I highly recommend!",5
"excellent food and drinks, our server was great.  they accommodated our party of 10, it was wonderful!",5
First time at Pigeon Forge and our host at the Jellystone Park suggested this place. It didn’t disappoint! Great burger (I had the Black and Bleu....pictured) and hand-cut fries. Beer brewed in house is fantastic as well. I had the Pernicious IPA. Fantastic!,5
"I’m not entirely sure why there are so many 5-star reviews, because our experience was not good.  We ordered artichoke/spinach dip and onion rings for appetizers, rib eye and crab cakes for main course, and a dessert.

Appetizers were good, and the rib eye cooked decently, and lemonade was great. However the rest of the dishes were awful. Crab cakes were overly salty and dry like a pretzel. Side salad had some wilted, expired pieces mixed in, the steamed broccoli was so overcooked it disintegrated, and sautéed spinach was swimming in a bowl of hot oil. I get that some don’t like or care about vegetables (notice all the photos here—nothing impressive). But we do.

As for the dessert, the waitress delivered the wrong order—the pudding cake only she talked about. We had already spent a considerable amount of time at the restaurant (especially the time waiting for a table) and were too tired to argue about it. We took the check and left the dessert on the table.

From the reviews here, this restaurant has a lot of fans. We’re not one of them. Extremely disappointed..",2
"Every day we drove by there was a line outside before they opened, with good reason the food is fantastic. Definitely make a reservation, the wait times get a little long.",5
"Friendly service & good food.
We went on a Tuesday night around 7 PM.  It is a very popular restaurant; we were a party of two and had a 35 minute wait. The bar had some seating available with a slightly shorter wait. We chose to wait for the dining room. Very clean women's restroom.
We would definitely return.

I had the Portabella Burger with Seasonal Vegetables. The veggies were flavorful, a little fatty/oily for my taste. The burger was a little bland but it was very nice that there was a vegetarian option!",4
Amazing food and great service!,5
"Very delicious place. Have always wanted to go here, but sometimes the wait to get in is just too long. Fortunately today we only had to wait 10-15 minutes (it's usually upwards of an hour or so).  From the wings all the way to dessert, none of the fam was dissapointed. It truly makes a difference with local and fresh made ingredients. If there was a down side (ultimate sarcasm), there are too many things I want to try and eat. Definitely worth the wait and money. We will be back!!!",5
"Awesome food! Great service. This is a must try if you are in Pigeon Forge,  TN.",5
"The food, craft beers and service here are just incredible! Definitely a must stop every time we are in PF.",5
"As with every good restaurant in Gatlinburg, there was a line out the door within 30 minutes of opening. We were behind about 20 people when we first arrived but were seated within 10 minutes. Our server Katie was very attentive and ensured our table was satisfied with each plate & drink we ordered. The food is all fresh and made in house and everything tasted amazing. Highly recommend the Local Goat if you're in the area.",5
"Nothing special, not worth the hour plus wait.  Comparable to eating at O'Charley's.",3
Lots of choices of hamburgers. Your onion rings are really good. They can move a lot of people through there restaurant in a short. Of time.,5
"Very good, one of the few good restaurants in the area. This place seems to stay busy so call ahead. Service is good. We had fettuccine Rocco, southern salad, and a few other items. They also have a few vegan options as well.",5
"Very great service, food was really good also. Nice to find a place that has a great craft beer selection, really wide array of food to choose from, but also accommodates kids. Would definitely recommend.",5
"Came here to grab a bite before starting our Christmas vacation and we were blown away by the food and drinks! We had Taylor as our server/bartender and he was amazing! Great drink recommendations, great conversation, and the food was perfect. I had the Carmel Appletini, Joe vs the Volcano, Fall Sipper, and the Irish snowman, and a Bloody Mary. All visually appealing and delicious! This is the first place I've ordered a rare steak and actually received it rare. The portions are huge as well! Amazing! I seriously can't say anything bad about this place. Will definitely visit again if we're in the area!",5
"We ordered dessert first it was that good and get this the mixed drinks were reasonably priced ""8 bucks"" and man the food was great I got the coconut shrimp and Mac and cheese had lava cake for dessert appetizer it was all fabulous and to top it all off the staff we had was wonderfully nice",5
"This place is consistently great. Friendly staff, amazing burgers.",5
"Got the GMT burger best burger I've ever had,the hand cut fries were great. The bun which is made in house was awesome, the service was fast and friendly. The fried deviled egg appetizor was fun to try will definitely be back .",5
Local gem in Pigeon Forge. Local food and local beer. Prices are decent. Wait staff is decent as well. Food has been tasty both times I have been. $18 for a half rack of ribs with 2 sides and delicious.,5
"Great food!Not much of an atmosphere,  good prices!  You will need to make reservations or plan on a wait!! A very popular restaurant in Pigeon Forge!! We had very Good service and  we Will go back!!!",5
"Update, if I left a review in April. The Schrute burger is DISGUSTING now. My dog ate it but he literally eats ANYTHING.",1
"This place was nothing short of Amazing!!! The server, the food... everything! The fried eggs are fabulous. You must try the Mac and Cheese it was the best I've ever tasted. The drinks were perfect!!
Thanks Gerard for the best experience while trying out a new restaurant.  We will be back possibly even tomorrow for dinner. :)",5
"Great food, great drinks, great times. The fried devil eggs were amazing. The burgers are huge and cooked to perfection. We had the one with goat cheese and caramelized onions and the burboun glazed burger. The fried are outstanding. Reminds me of potatoe straws.",5
"We were expecting fresh,  not so much.  It’s just mediocre food, the run of the mill.",3
"Nice atmosphere, quirky theme, goats, and good food at reasonable prices. I had a nice ahi tuna steak.",5
"Extremely popular restaurant with over an 1 hour wait on a Sunday night at 8 pm.  We were going for apps and desert.  The cheese fondue was good and they offered free refills of the bread/pretzels for dipping.  My wife liked the crème brulee.  I had the chocolate lave a cake which was all cake and no lava.  Not very tasty at that.  The service was what you would expect from a busy restaurant, somewhat slow, but not bad consider the circumstances.  The table next to us was frustrated that they were out of a number of things on the menu and both the wait staff and the management handled the situation very poorly (rude and dismissive).  I don't think I would return to the Local Goat.",3
Was good food and the waiter was awesome.  Best waiter I've seen in years. Forgot his name though.,4
"Charlotte natives surrounded by great food and let’s just say we were thoroughly impressed. Per my husband “OUTSTANDING FOOD AND SERVICE!” - as someone who isn’t a steak person, I thoroughly enjoyed the steak and everything else they had to offer. This is definitely a place we’d come back to!",5
Great burgers! Great fries! A HUGE alcohol menu. Just don't get Jade as your waitress.,5
"Was recommended by another restaurant to visit this establishment. We tried reserving a table ahead but was unsuccessful however, upon arriving we were seated with in the time it took to park and walk to the door via text. The waitstaff was great, clean and wearing masks. Our server Jason was excellent and attentive to our family. By far the best food we had on our family visit. After a long day out exploring the food & beer sure did hit the spot.",5
"Great food, all locally sourced and made fresh. Definitely a must go if in the area.",5
"Omg the Hawaiian ribeye 🤤🤤 I don't know what is in that sauce but I assume the secret ingredient is unicorn tears.

We had an hour wait, zero shade to block from the hot sun. To the Local Goat  I highly recommend getting some umbrellas for out front or planting shade trees. We did find a hidden shade spot behind the building to wait. We just sat on the ground like a bunch of wild animals (we didn't mind), but for real get some umbrellas for the Karen's.
So we FINALLY get a table after squatting out back watching the ice deliveries for an hour . (Actual ice, not code for rhymes with hugs.

Our table we were given was the first one next to the entrance. Sooo I didn't get a good view of the restaurant. I could vaguely see a light up sign on the wall and some hipster looking decor. I'm sure it was nice.

Our server was prompt yet forgettable. We ordered deep fried deviled eggs for appetizer as it was recommended on Yelp. Ours didn't taste freshly cooked. More like the fried rubber eggs were sitting under a heat lamp for a while then they garnished them with filling. Not the best thing I've had in my mouth, but definitely not the worst. 😉

Both me and my child opted for the Hawaiian ribeye And Soo glad we did. It was a pleasant transition from whatever the rubber mess was Yelp told us to eat. I ordered spinach and mashed potatoes on the side, the spinach was sitting in a bowl of butter, every part of my being knew that couldn't have ended well had I attempted more than a bite. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Had to try it. Was ... Buttery just as it looked.
The steak tho... I'd go sit in a dim lit 90 degree alley as the ice man side eyes me all judgey, like a wild animal juuuust to buy another Hawaiian ribeye. The mashed potatoes were good too.

This place was packed and I'm assuming it's because they are all rushing there to buy that steak. It was a miracle I found a parking spot. If you have zero patience and get aggravated easily STAY AWAY FROM HERE. (Local Goat you are welcome)

Expect a wait time, Expect busy staff as this place is packed, Expect good food! Expect to sit in your car and wait if you don't want the sun scorching a hole in your soul. I wish we had ordered different dishes so we could try different foods. But every thing we did order except the heat lamp  rubber eggs were flavorful and delicious. 5 gold stars, highly recommend. Just for the steak.",5
"This place is expensive but it's good the Elvis burger was just ok but how many places serve a burger with peanut butter and fried bananas on it cooked to perfection those fries are right on.
Pricey. Be ready to climb a hill but after your meal it's all down hill from there",5
Great food. Impressive burger list and all sauces are house made.,5
Very good food! A little pricey but worth it if you are looking for a good meal. Server could have been friendlier. Would give 4 or 5 stars.,4
Absolutely amazing food.  No matter what you get you will not be disappointed!,5
"Absolutely amazing. Our server Josh was so nice. The food is pricey but so freaking worth it. My mom and stepdad are super picky when eating out and they loved the place. Food will fill you up and then some so you might need to split a plate, especially if you order an appetizer or 2.",5
Nice and clean. Food was fresh and flavorful. Shrimp and grits was excellent.,5
"We had a family of 12. We called ahead for seating. Which was a good idea because they were busy.   Sat promptly  on time for our reservation. Priscilla was our sever.  Our sever was amazing. Priscilla told us about the restaurant and an overview of the menu. Offered drink recommendations, which were fantastic.  My husband and I had ribeyes they were perfectly cooked. We also tried the deep fried deviled eggs. Just wow! If you are a tourist like us you must go.  We are from Nashville and will definitely be back next trip. I always love when you leave a restaurant and feel great about the money you spent there. I have been a GM of restaurants for 20 years. These people know what they are doing. Yum!",5
Amazing food! Onion rings were more like bracelets!,5
"Pretty good, but pretty pricey.",4
"My husband and I were vacationing in Gatlinburg, TN for the weekend and we ate at the Local Goat TWICE in one weekend because it was THAT good. Service was incredible, our waitress, Jennie was amazing and we had her both nights we were there! We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes (def recommend) and burgers both nights! Burgers were outstanding, however, we ordered them medium and they seemed to have been cooked to medium well. No biggie! Still amazing food!! We never waited for a table more than 30 mins on a Fri/Sat night around 7pm! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5
The food was amazing and the service superb! We'll be back!,5
Fantastic meal! We had a wonderful bartender named Megan. She gave us great advise on places to visit while in pigeon forge and Gatlinburg.  Great experience!,5
The best food in Pigeon Forge. Burgers are great. Steaks are great. Salads are great. Service is great. Stop reading reviews and go eat.,5
Top notch service and excellent wings!!!,5
By far the best place I've eaten in Pigeon Forge. I had the sirloin and shrimp both were delicious. My wife was eating ribs with a fork they were so tender. This will be one of the first places we eat when we return.,5
If I could this place 0 starts I would I was completely disappointed I never been to Tennessee I was so exited and I heard a lot about this place I wish they had better service and felt like it could’ve been cleaner. Justin was my bartender and he was rude had to remind him countless of times to refill my drinks. I asked him what you guys are known for since I’m not from the area and he ignored my question and he rolled his eyes and said everything and completely walked away. Will never go back again and will tell all my local friends who live here about this restaurant.,1
Awesome foodie experience.  A true gem.,5
Wow this place has great food!! Highly recommend trying it out but make reservations 24 hrs in advance.,5
We went in and tried to order wings that were on the menu and was told it would be an hour to an hour and half for them. We left. They tried to make us pay for food we ordered and did not receive. I would never recommend this place....ever!!!,1
"Great experience,  excellent food and exceptional service.  Food is locally sourced and you can taste the freshness.   Can not wait for our next visit to Pigen Forge and the Local Goat.",5
GREAT FOOD!! The burgers are amazing.,5
"Great Hawaiian ribeye, perfectly cooked. Good service. My only complaints were that the fried deviled eggs didn’t seem too terribly fresh and the burgers are so large that it drowns out all the other flavors in the sandwich which is a shame because the pimiento cheese on mine was terrific by itself.",4
Fantastic food and excellent service from Tiffany.  Really great place.,5
Great food and great service! We'll be coming back on the next trip up here 😊,5
"For a tourist town this place is a solid 4. I say that because most tourist town spots really aren't that good...but this spot is on point for 4 stars.

The fried deviled eggs were super tasty and I may need to learn to make my own. The onion rings were also good and the ranch dip was super.

Ribs were fall off the bone  good and sauce was tangy and I wanted more.

The burger was okay...I say just okay because I ordered a medium burger but all 3 we ordered delivered well done....not a hint of pink to be found. Why ask if you cook them all the same?? Fries were cut in house and had a bit of crunch, real good job on the fries.

Would I come back? Yes and I'd try other dishes.",4
Large portion size.  Very good food.  Prices are fair for what your getting.   It was a good experience.,5
"First things first - make a reservation. Then, have the stuffed piquillo peppers. With the goat cheese and balsamic, possibly the best thing on the menu. The fried green tomatoes are crispy, and the gravy is delicious. Both the lamb burger and the Tennessee whiskey burger are up there with the best burgers I've ever had. They should bottle and sell the whiskey glaze.",5
Excellent food and service.,5
Their burgers are delicious and are very big. Could easily be shared between two people. I will definitely eat here again next time I visit the area.,4
Service was great and the food was delicious.  Could not have been better.,5
"Came to spend spring break with 6 other people in pigeon forge, we arrived at 9:30pm. Nothing was going to be open late enough. The local goat was the only thing that was open until 11. We got there at 9:50 waited for 35 min and they were still taking names. Our waitress Madison I believe her name was, was amazing she was more than happy to stay past 11 as were all the other servers that were still there. The place was packed well after 11. The food was amazing. I had the Maui chicken yummmmm.  Yall everything that we all had tasted amazing. We had zero complaints. We will 100% be back. Thank you so much for the great experience.",5
Not the hype made up to be. Good service with ok food. We ordered Ribeyes with not a whole lot of flavor. Sad to say I've had better steaks at Texas Roadhouse.,3
Our server didn't bring bread to our table and we rarely saw him at our table during the visit. The steaks and the baked potatoes were dry also. The only good thing about our visit was the restaurant setting. Never again.......,1
"I got the Hawaiian ribeye. It was so good and a big portion. I ate it ALL!
The sear on that steak was definitely worth the price and the marinade was not too sweet.
The brocolini was amazing too. My man got the steak tips and rice and he loved it as well. For an appetizer we got the stuffed peppers with goat cheese and that was really good. I have to figure out how to make those now at home.

The Thai peanut dressing for my salad was the best dressing I ever had. Make sure you get that!

The drinks were good too I had the berry mule. It was not to gingery. Mostly berry.

We got there around 940 on a Friday and only a 10-15 minute wait. If we went earlier then it might be a 45 minute wait. This place definitely is worth it but you can tell it's one of the better restaurants so people go there.

They did sit us in the back room. It looked like a garage. It had a fireplace that was not on and it was cold. That was my only complaint.

The servers were good.",5
Food was wonderful and we will go back,5
Service was great. Food was ok.   They definitely did not live up to the reputation we had heard about,3
Great burgers,5
Good food!  Expect to wait for a table because this place fills up fast!,4
BEST BURGERS EVERRRRR!!!!   LOVE their 'Funky Monkeys'. And great Maui ckn and bread pudding!,5
My sister and I loved this place! The staff was super fun. My burger was ahhhmazing.,5
"The best restaurant in Pigeon Forge hands down! We have been herefor 3 days and this is the best we have had here. Ilona was excellent and attentive.  It was so good, we made a reservation for tomorrow night. Pass all the other places and go here! Reservations are recommended.",5
Excellent!!  Food and service were both very good.,5
"Great Burgers, amazing fries.",5
"The food here is GREAT! Everything is locally sourced, and made from scratch, and it shows. They even make their own ketchup.",5
AMAZING! I'd give it 6 if I could!,5
We were seated quickly. The manager welcomed us right away and checked on us after a while. The appetizer Fried Green Tomatoes was excellent! The food was very very good!! Great service!! We felt very spoiled!,5
EXCELLENT food and GREAT beer!!! Wait staff is very attentive! One of the best steaks I've had at any restaurant!,5
Stopped in for lunch service. Fried deviled egg appetizer is a must! Husband got a lamb burger and he loved it! We willful sure be back!!,5
This was a decent restaurant but it was very pricey.,3
"The food and service are great!  This is, without a doubt, our favorite restaurant.",5
Great Ribeye steak and salads,5
Service and food was great! Good liquor choices as well! My first burger with an egg on it won't be the last. The fried deviled eggs were soooo good!,5
Best place to eat in the Smokies!,5
"The food was so worth the wait!!! I despise deviled eggs, theirs were incredibly delicious! The chicken and burgers were great! The cheesy grits and taters were delicious. Customer service was on point and friendly. All great things about this place!",5
A great selection of local craft beers that are quite good.  Try Bearded Iris (any of them). The deep fried deviled eggs are fantastic.  The peppers and shrimp appetizers are also quite good.,5
Wonderful food great atmosphere.,5
#1 Restaurant in the area’,5
Steak nachos were good but the ribeye was extremely bland & charred.,2
Food was worth the wait.(2hrs). Server was from Chicago and did an amazing job.,5
Amazing food. 10/10 would go again,5
"Dinner here was amazing! We got the spinach dip, onion rings, tn whiskey burger and teriyaki kabobs. Everything was amazing! Definitely call a few days ahead to make a reservation because we came at 4:30 on a Wednesday and waited almost an hour but was worth the wait!",5
"This is our go to restaurant when we visit the area. The staff is always very polite and quick on their feet. The place is usually very busy but you never feel rushed. I recommend making reservations. The food is consistently amazing. Very fresh and always prepared how you ask. I recommend the deviled eggs, the beer cheese app and any burger. I would eat at the Goat every day if I lived closer!",5
"If you are vegetarian, DO NOT get the plant based burger. It is incredibly disgusting. I've had multiple plant based burgers from restaurants in the past and this was by far the worst. I also got a mouthful of what I'm guessing was either plastic or parchment paper from where the patties were separated. Overall just a very gross experience.",1
"Excellent food, great service! My wife and I came for lunch. She had the Tuna Steak and I had the BGT Burger (Goat Cheese and bacon jam! Add bacon, you will thank me later!) Ben was an excellent waiter!",5
The wings were amazing!!,5
Sat at the bar. Great service!!!,5
"You will need a reservation if you don’t want to wait an hour. Big selection of beers and mixed drinks. Food was delicious with a big variety of choices. Our waiter/service  was decent, he seemed overwhelmed at times, but  they were slammed. We would come back again.",4
Very different having fried deviled eggs for the first time,5
Food is amazing and the bread pudding was out of this world.,5
"We've eaten here a few times and always been very happy.  It is a nice change from the tourist cafeterias that litter the area. The menu is varied and inspired. The servers are friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. On our recent visit we waited at the bar for our table and again we were impressed by this place.  The bar staff was just as good and the drinks were stellar. Our little band of eaters has a pile of food requirements too, severe gluten intolerance,  vegetarian, cow dairy allergy and keto. Probably our favorite spot in the area and we've been visiting for many years. Try the fried deviled eggs ;)",5
"Make a reservation or expect to wait over an hour. Staff was very friendly. Food was good, but a little pricey.",4
Very good food and service!,5
Food was amazing. Try the fried deviled eggs.,5
Great atmosphere and great food!,5
"I visited on Sunday April 25, 2021 and ordered the 10 oz. sirloin, baked potato and house salad.  The salad and baked potato were the best part of my meal.  The steak was tough to cut and very chewy.  This was my first visit to the restaurant.",3
"Great food and excellent service!
The only none related food problem is the parking, it bits the big one! 🤡",5
"Fantastic, Great Food, Atmosphere, and Staff.",5
Matt was the best! The wait was long but it was totally worth it. The food was amazing!!!,5
"Loved it! We were seated immediately and we each had a burger except for my youngest, who has many dietary restrictions and got grilled chicken. The burgers were delicious and the fries were amazing! Great beer selection.",5
"Got the onion rings, bacon cheeseburger + fries, wings, & sweet tea. EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious. Our waitress informed us that almost all of their ingredients/supplies used are made in house (THE BUN TO MY BURGER WAS MOUTH WATERING). HIGHLY suggest this. Just make sure to reserve ahead! May be in for a wait!",5
"The Local Goat seemed like the most popular restaurant in the area, and boasted a good menu. The parking lot was a bit crowded, but we were seated within about 30mins of waiting. The service and appetizers were fine (cheese fondu and spinach dip), but the entrees of pasta, steak salad, and chicken/rise were a bit bland. The chicken pasta did not have any real flavor, and the cheese did not taste very fresh. The burgers and ribs seemed like a better option, so if you decide to visit this restaurant stick with bar/tavern menu items and avoid any other types of entrees.",3
We really enjoyed this place. Excellent food and awesome cocktails.,4
Very nice restaurant and staff. Really good food and drinks.,5
"Food was horrible. I will say, however, we was seated within 5 minutes. They was very fast, but I still won’t be back.",1
"Great service, delicious food and a wide array of options. Would definitely go back again!",5
Food had an amazing assortment and twists to American Classics.  The Elvis Burger is definitely worth a try and our server Lane was one of the best waiters we have had in a very long time.  Will definitely make it a point to visit again when we are back in town.  Service and food was awesome!,5
The best shrimp and grits with wilted greens and caramelized onions. Try to go off hours as they are very popular.,5
Food was the best in the area with fresh ingredients for sure,5
Nice scrumptious food made from scratch. We had the Ahi tuna appetizer fried green tomatoes lamb burger seafood bisque. Quick service and not a long wait on Easter Sunday.,5
"Second time eating here a year apart. Repeatedly awesome results. The fried deviled eggs are amazing! Great burgers, great place overall can't recommend them enough.",5
Great Fish n Chips,5
"Jacob was our waiter and he was excellent...he was very friendly and helpful...shared some local activities that fit our schedule. Now for the food most excellent, burgers, fried tomatoes, tuna and great salads. Will return",5
"Excellent food and selection for adults and children. Next time we're in Pigeon Forge, this is a must-stop for dinner!",5
Absolutely wonderful food. The shrimp and grits were amazing.,5
"Great food, awesome burgers & local brews. Friendly & good management & staff",5
"This is the third time I have ate here, and it is WONDERFUL! I highly recommend the Hawaiian Ribeye. I have ate at a lot of 5 star restaurants, including out of the country, ans I have to say this is hands down the BEST STEAK I have ever had. Everything is good. Onion ring appetizer, yum. The fact that the food is all local makes it that much better. Can’t wait to see you in Chattanooga. 🤞",4
Absolutely delicious! I ordered the 10 oz sirloin with a house salad & whipped sweet potatoes. Everyone at my table enjoyed their food. We will be going here every time we visit PF!,5
Very friendly!! Even the visitors/customers. The food is delicious!,5
Most amazing food I have had in my life. I absolutely would recommend giving this place a try. It was very busy but so worth the wait.,5
"I wanted to get dinner somewhere that wasn't so touristy.  This place caught my eye.  The environment is on the nicer side of casual.  Our table service was excellent.  And the food... It's rare that I get a specialty burger that I don't wanna doctor up.  But not this time.  I got the TN Whiskey and my wife got a goat cheese thing.  Both were excellent and filling (yes, I stole a bite of my wife's).  Bonus, the ketchup is made in-house and was right up my alley.  I've never felt the need to review a condiment before.  My only complaint is that I hate shoestring style fries.  But some people love them.  So who am I to judge.",5
"Wonderful experience.  My husband got the tuna and I got the nachos. He was skeptical when he got it with it being raw for the most part but tried it and was blown away. Best fish he's ever had he said. Our server, Justin, was phenomenal!",5
"Oh if you're in Pigeon Forge, don't miss this restaurant. It's worth the wait! No wonder the parking lot is always full, it's because they serve very good food! Friendly servers and yummylicious food, you can never go wrong. Southern hospitality at its finest! Would love to go back there! <3",5
Excellent food. Waitress was very accomidating.,5
Amazing burgers! Got the Smokehouse Burger and it was massive!  I could have easily shared it with my husband.  You can get fries which was a generous portion as well.  My husband substituted for a side salad at no additional cost that was also a generous in size.  I highly recommend and the staff were extremely nice.,5
"This place is amazing, I found a momma goat and her two babies in back of store they are so adorable.",5
This deserves all the praise it gets. Food was more than delicious!! We came here twice in one trip because I said I couldn't leave without eating the salad again. Best salad ever. There is a huge wait but it's worth it. You can also reserve ahead of time.,5
Was a great experience as always,5
Absolutely amazing. I had heard great things about this place and was a little worried with it being in a tourist trap area. But it exceeded my expectations and I will be back,5
Good food and plenty as well,5
I was excited to eat somewhere different in Pigeon Forge but was sadly disappointed.  The burgers were good but not worth the price. My daughter ordered the coconut shrimp and they were not edible. They tasted like they were soaked in sugar. We ended up wishing we had eaten at The Old Mill.,2
"Excellent place to eat, definitely earned their #1 rating with us today. Food and service were great with hardly any wait. 5 stars for sure.",5
"A burger here is a must! Be sure to save some space for dessert as the bread pudding will NOT disappoint! Service was great, restaurant is very clean, and our food was out quickly!",5
"I am a beef producer and a steak man , but that steak let me down .The Rib-eye was well done (burnt) and I ordered rare . If one is paying top beef price for a steak then one should order it where there is a trained professional that takes pride in their prepared creations that actually knows
the difference between rare and burnt when it comes to an almost 30$ steak . Before the disappointment of my steak  I ordered a drink and my wife ordered one as well . My ”Old Fashion“was not drinkable not to mention high (14$) , my wife’s “sunrise” had black particle matter floating in hers . She was about to drink it and thought maybe that it may be part of their recipe . Then she starts thinking to herself  what could be the black particles  . After several minutes of her trying to “Chopstick”
the particles out of her cup with her mixing straws she questioned our waiter . To no avail , the particles were foreign and not part of a special new way this place does it’s tequila sunrise . Still , evenwith the disappointments... I gotta give credit where credit is due and  our waiter was great ..  but what was handed to him ... not so much . If I’m paying top shelf price I would have expected a top
shelf drink .If i pay for. 30$ steak I expect a knowledgeable  cook to cook it . I  can leave this review with these words  of praise and say that out of the experience  ...  my wife’s ribs was on time and my daughter loved the hot dog.",5
Local sourced food. All condiments made in house!,5
Best food we've had in Pigeon Forge or Gatlinburg. Definitely worth the wait. Excellent food and very keto friendly!!,5
The food and service were top notch.  The Fettuccini Rocco was the best chicken and fettuccine dish I've ever had.,5
Great food and service. Definitely go more towards lunch if you don't want to wait,5
This restaurant had a really cool atmosphere.  The burgers were good and the steak was amazing.  We were not overly impressed with the starters.  Would visit again.,4
Try the pepper's and the burgers are amazing!,5
"Not just a clever name! Service was great. We had Vladimir who was very professional, helpful and attentive. Food was creative, big portions and really really good. Great beer selections on tap. We're from out of town and would definitely come back again when/ if we come back.",5
Great food. And service,5
"Very good, unique food. Family friendly as well. We'll be back.",4
"Great food and great service.  Made a reservation, got seated right on time.  I ordered the ribeye, it was cooked perfectly and was delicious.  Highly recommend!",5
Great food and concept. All locally made down the the dressing and sauces,5
"UNLESS YOU WANT TO WAIT 2 HOURS MAKE RESERVATIONS, AND MAKE THEM NOW!  Even with reservations we waited 30 mins past until we got seated.  The food was excellent, nothing bad to say.  Parking was a PITA, the whole parking lot appears to have been designed for nothing but little econoboxes.  There beer selection is superb.  The only thing I would say needs a little work is there gluten free selections.  A person in our party had a gluten allergy, and for everything being made fresh, blah blah blah, they had VERY few gluten free options.  This is/was disappointing, because you would have thought the chef would have come out and inquired about how they could accommodate, considering everything is MTO.  IMHO any establishment that is worth there snot, especially one that claims everything is MTO and has there waiters and waitresses boast about it would go out of there way to make sure those with food restrictions are taken care of...",3
Amazing food and service.  Deep fried deviled eggs are a must!  Comfortable and casual atmosphere.  Sincerely recommend the Local Goat.,5
Great locally grown food and everything is homemade.,4
"Great atmosphere, little up scale with good vibes. Wait staff are professional. Food is fantastic, great selection of beers. Definitely a go to spot if you're in pigeon forge.",5
Best place to eat because they don't have any hormones in their meat and the food is amazing,5
Our family really loves getting burgers and fries at Local Goat! We’ll drive from Knoxville just for the food.,5
Don't waste your time and money is all I'll say,3
"We could not say enough great things about Local Goat and our server Sara Jane! The food and service were spectacular. I ordered the Jalapeño Mango Margarita which was great and the BBQ chicken nachos were incredible as well. Be aware that wait times are usually long if you visit during peak hours! The wait is definitely worth it and our server was very friendly, quick and charismatic. Excellent experience!",5
"This place did not disappoint. The wait was only 15 minutes, they do a heckuva job getting you seated.  Then the food all I can say is WOW,  you have to to get the Deep fried deviled eggs awesome.  The cheese fondue was also very good, our entrees did not disappoint burger was so good. The staff is excellent,  on the ball very good.  I strongly recommend this place when you're here",5
Local Goat was good.  Local farm to table restaurant.  Reasonable prices.   The restaurant was crowded.  The food was good.,4
A little disappointed. Crab cakes were subpar and burger was just ok.,3
"First the manager was great by relocating us to a booth as requested with no problems.  Second our sibks were perfect.  Third was our fondue appetizer was great. Our waitress Jenny was amazing. From recommending the ribs to bringing us extra jalepeno ranch that she loves, to being so friendly. Dinner was awsome. She was the best waitress we had all week and would be back in a flash. Thanks for the great conversation as well. Loved it 👍👍👍",5
Best shrimp and grits ever,5
Me and my fiance came here from a recommendation that the food was amazing. Which the burgers and fries where amazing and the salad where delicious but the appetizers where absolutely horrible. The steak nachos where practically inedible because the chips where super stale even though the waitress expressed so many times that every thing was made fresh which the fried deviled eggs where not fresh they where cold. Maybe they make them fresh in the morning and then just leave them in bin until someone orders them. Do yourself a favor and stay away from their appetizers.,3
"This is a place the locals also go so that says alot...
Food was good, impressive bourbon selection for not being in Kentucky..
Service was friendly and on top of it...
Usually a wait to get in so try not to go during peak times...",4
GREAT FOOD AND EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!,5
"Great food, great service. Deviled egg appetizer was different and delicious.",5
Great food.   Long wait but we'll worth it.,5
The cocktails were Amazing! Definitely try the watermelon crawl if you like mixed drinks.,5
"Great service and food! We had the best waiter! (Tall with an accent, can’t remember his name.) We will definitely be back next time we visit!",5
"5 stars because they truly deserve it! We came on a Sunday, and only waited about 30 minutes! We had probably one of the best servers I have ever had at a tourist restaurant. Ben was outstanding! He had excellent customer service, was friendly, he recommended great dishes and even handled and corrected a minor issue we had. The Ahi Fish sandwich was spot on and the fries are to die for! We had wings for app, and the jalapeno ranch is a great dipping sauce! Great atmosphere, great staff, and heat burger joint. Will definitely put this place on my try agains when in the area!",5
"Read reviews about cleanliness and good COVID precautions....NOT the case when we went on a Tuesday night. Very over crowded and many guests walking around without masks on. When cleaning tables it was a very quick wipe down of the table top only, not chairs or cleaner that sat more than a couple seconds. We were very uncomfortable about the safety and cleanliness and wish we would have left before ordering. Food was pretty good and our server was nice, just didn’t see him much probably because it was so busy.",2
"Amazing food and service!!! This place is REALLY busy, I now know why....",5
Excellent… can’t wait to come back again. This will be a future dining spot for us.,5
"Tavern steak, strawberry salad, and fried green tomatoes are delicious!",5
"Ok so if you've been on the parkway you've probably drivin right past this place an saw a PACKED parking lot, which is deceiving. The wait here really isn't that long at all, we got a party of 6 in as soon as we walked into the door. So don't be fooled by the parking lot.

The food is pretty good. Definitely worth trying when your down there!",4
Good food and a nice variety of beer on tap. Place seems to always be super busy. Wait was an hour and a half. Ended up finding a spot at the bar.,5
Always enjoy the food was crazy bust still only waited 10 minutes for a table,5
"Not bad.  A bit pricey.  The lava cake was mostly cake, not much lava.  Not worth it.",3
By the name I probably would have never tried eating here but a co worker insisted so we tried it and were very pleased!! We had fried green tomatoes I had teriyaki chicken and fiance had steak and kabobs food tasted so wonderful and the goat cheese on the tomatoes was surprisingly amazing. We will def be back! And the waitress was so wonderful,5
Excellent food and service.  My fish and chips were most and flaky.,5
"Great food, good beer select and friendly staff. Would definitely go again",5
"The food had unique flavors that were executed well, and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. I knew we were in for a good experience just based on the number of cars in the parking lot. The fried deviled eggs were a great starter, and the burgers were cooked to order and delicious! All meat is ground in-house. Highly recommend.",5
Solid place to eat. Service was good. More casual than we expected. Mashed potatoes were overworked. Not the greatest food in my opinion but an accessible menu with friendly staff. Leave early so you can get a parking space.,4
Local Goat had a great atmosphere to the place. Our waiter was very kind and knowledgeable. The food was pretty good as well with good value considering how popular the restaurant is.,5
"This place was so good!  I had a burger with goat cheese, crispy onions and bacon jam. Oh my goodness yum!  Fries are super good too. My husband had steak and crab cake. Also very good! My son really like the chicken tenders. Burger and steak were cooked as ordered.  Definitely would come here again.",5
"This was my third time eating here. The cheese fondue is so good! It comes with apples, white bread, and pretzels and the pretzels were amazing! The burgers are huge and tasty (I had the TN whiskey glaze burger) and the fries are crispy and delicious. We tried the fried green tomatoes but whatever was on top took away from the tomato too much but over all it was very tasty. We did not have a reservation and we were seated within 20 minutes on a Friday afternoon.",4
"We loved our visit to the Local Goat! This place has the best food, it was well worth trying.",5
"Great meal, great service, and great beer selection... Add it all together and toss in some incredible prices for everything and you have an unbeatable combination. Everything we ate and drank exceeded our expectations. David was one of the best servers we have had in a very long time and we were there at the end of dinner service. I would strongly suggest the Fried Green Tomatoes, Black and Blue Burger, David as your server, and anything he recommends! Oh! And those fries. OMG!!!",5
Great place everything I wanted an more. Would love to go back,5
Fantastic food. Expect a wait. Very friendly service. I has the hawian ribeye and it was delicious.,5
My husband and I google places to eat when on vacation and pick places based on google reviews. I’m excited and thankful that we found The Local Goat! The deviled eggs were spectacular! I got the sirloin with grilled shrimp and he got the ribs....Amazing! Our server was also awesome! We will definitely be back the next time we are visiting Pigeon Forge!,5
"food, drinks and service was top tier! James did us well! we will be back",5
Great food! Even went back a 2nd time on our visit . The only problem there is the parking.,5
"The food and atmosphere was awesome. The food is very fresh and made to order. Everything was delicious. I got the Maui Chicken and it was beyond amazing. Super juicy and tender, perfectly cooked. The rice was awesome. My wife got the ribs and the meat literally falls off the bone. Everything was wonderful. Last but not least the service was perfectly on point. I highly recommend going here, oh! and the prices are very reasonable; I'd say almost underpriced for the quality of food and service that you get. This is one of those restaurants you need to try.",5
"Worth the wait! Local Goat is a treasure!
Parking lot is crazy and very steep, but the food is worth the work!
Teriyaki Medalions were delicious. Strawberry salad was divine. Fondu was stupid good!",5
Very good food. Reservations are a must if you don't want to wait 90+ minutes.,5
"The burgers are to die for; imagine a hint of sweet mixed with a lightly salty and sour flavor...Also, the customer service was on point. We came almost at closing time, and yet, the guy seems so happy to serve us. Even though, he was not expecting anymore customers, he went above and beyond. I wish I remembered his name...",5
Love this place!  Always the 1st place we eat everytime we come to Pigeon Forge.,5
Fantastic!! Every bit as good as I was told it was..I can't say if they have the best pasta because I didn't get it while there...they had plenty of options for vegan/vegetarian it was very refreshing and very tasty! Will definitely be back.,5
Best ribs...amazing service..,5
"Great ambiance, service and food. Will definitely come back soon!",5
Absolutely love this place. Our new favorite go to restaurant. Always busy but WORTH the wait. Great service and atmosphere. Best food around.,5
We were told about this place from some people we met while zip lining. Waits are crazy long but well  worth it. Food is amazing and priced better than we expected.,5
"One of the best places I've been in long time . It's a MUST!!
So first off everything is local and fresh no gmo and also have gluten free options. Everything was made in house and fresh.
We started with the fried deviled eggs. Fettuccini Rocco was awesome, rich creamy sauce and super juice and tender chicken. The bread was great also something about the flavor and the homemade texture made it finger licking good!!!
Shrimp and grits😍😍😍OMG!! the seasoning was GREAT!! Yum yum yum is all that can be said!! The one little... whatever. Our salad came out with our meals. The homemade dressing....😍😍🤗lort HELP!!! I may have to try and go back before I leave. This is night one and if the rest if the trio is as good as dinner... this will be my favorite vacation spot!!!
Did I forget to mention MOST IS LOCAL AND FRESH MADE!! Ask for Kaylee she was very sweet and friendly!
They also have a very long list of local brewed beer. The bartender was very helpful and recommended the perfect beer for me!! I need this restaurant back home🤣🤣",5
OUTSTANDING!!! Yuri was the nicest and most attentive server I've had. Our food was so delicious and fresh tasting. Definitely would love to return again!!,5
"Yuri was awesome, food was great",5
"Great fun! Wish the line had been shorter, but the experience was really fun!",5
Great food! Glad we got reservations! Very popular place to eat!,5
"Excellent food, the crab bisque was amazing and our waitress Nic was awesome! I’ll definitely eat there every time I’m in pigeon forge! Totally recommend, you won’t be disappointed!",5
Good food and fast friendly service. Reasonable prices. Really enjoyed the Bearded Iris IPA.,5
This is a nice place but the quality didn’t match the price,3
"Amazing food, tons of options and excellent service. It's a must try I'm my book, you won't be sorry.",5
Outstanding burgers. The whole family got one and we all love them. The fondue as an appetizer was out of this world.,5
Definitely a must try!! Ask for Angela O. She was truly the kindest most helpful and attentive waitress! She truly made the experience wonderful! Amazing food and again even better service! MUST STOP AND TRY! Definitely will be coming back! 🥰,5
"Fries were to small
and steak was chewy",2
"Superb food, great prices",5
"We waited 45 minutes for a table. I didn't mind the wait, we were prepared for that, but sitting in the hot sun was bad. Very few outside seats and NO shade. I found the man who takes your name to be a little rude, but he was strictly observing the covid rules. No going in the lobby even for a minute to cool off. Our waitress was very helpful when we were ordering, the homemade ranch dressing was delicious, good salad! They use Sriracha a lot,  so if you're like me, you might have a hard time finding something to eat. My husband loved it, me I wouldn't bother going back. That being said every time we drove by it was crowded.",3
Sat at the bar and had a flite from their amazing selection of craft beer.   Delightful and attentive staff.  Enjoyed their steak nachos and deep fried deviled eggs! Saving this place as a favorite and will return!,5
"I would give 6 stars if I could. This place came recommend to us by our bartender at the resort we were staying at, and let me say the information was on point. The food and service were amazing. The appetizer came out super fast as well as the main courses. The server was very attentive and we wanted for nothing. If we are ever back this way, this place is must for stopping in.",5
Delicious and unique food choices.  The deep fried deviled eggs were amazing!,5
"Good, modestly priced food. Service was excellent. We stopped in on recommendation of a friend. Glad she told me!",5
"The BEST LAMB BURGER OMG!!! Local Goat... first time impression has been a lasting impression! Loved it and ....our waiter was a amazing. HE was short, slim and said he'd been with local Goat since they opened I believed 3yrs ago...... anyways , he treated my husband & I very well.",5
Probably the best burgers I've had in Sevierville.  We had the farm burger but you can't really go wrong with any of them.  Give them a try!,5
Smokehouse Burger and Buffalo wings as appetizers. Trust me.,5
Amazing food! A new favorite when we visit this area.,5
It was ok. There is a variety of options. The food is ok. Probably won't go back except to pick up the white chocolate bread pudding!,3
"Great food, friendly staff",5
"Average. Average service, average food and super packed. Not bad but there is definitely better options for the price.",3
It's ok definitely not worth the hype.,3
Very clean good food and drinks. Would go back,5
"We drove by this restaurant our first night in town and made a comment about how it must be good because the parking lot was packed! The next day at lunch time it was less crowded so we decided to give it a shot. Best food decision of our entire 8 state vacation!!
The food was amazing!! I ordered the Pimento cheese cheeseburger and it is by far the best burger I have ever had at a restaurant. It was cooked to perfection and so very juicy. The onion rings were good and crispy and we loved the jalepeno ranch.
We highly recommend! This is a must stop if you are in this area.",5
"Service was great. Kara was very helpful with menu choices and attentive to the table needs.  We had about a 10 min wait to be seated on a Saturday afternoon. The food was prepared well and served hot. Everything is scratch made including the ketchup (which can be purchased by the bottle, but they do ask that you call in advance so it can be prepared for you). Really wish the frys had been cut a little longer so you could dip them easier.",4
Hands down the Best food in the 3 city area.,5
"Made a reservation for a Monday evening (due to it being packed on the wknds). This place is a ""winner winner chicken dinner"" Excellent service and the food was a 10 in both taste and presentation. Will visit again for sure next trip",5
Service at the bar was terrific.   Burgers are huge and delicious. Thanks for a great experience.,5
Great service and delicious steaks!,5
"Food was excellent, service was top notch,  and the atmosphere was off the charts.  My daughter has everyone in the place dancing with her. Really had a great time.",5
Excellent food! and they take reservations. Rough for elderly and handicapped. Only 2 handicapped parking spots and the parking lot is an uphill climb.,4
The food at the local goat was phenomenal and service was great. However social distancing is not being followed here . No one is 6 ft apart and the place is packed.  There is signs about wearing mask and you will wait in your car to be called to your table. After that rules don't apply!,4
The wait time was rediculous but the food was good. Our waitress was great. Decently priced. Everything is from local farms.,4
"Beat our expectations for food quality, flavors, presentation, and service and our expectations were pretty high based on the reviews!  We had the deep fried deviled eggs, shrimp and grits, ribeye, and the creme brulee.  All was phenomenal!",5
"Great food and drink, unique selection",5
Awesome shrimps and grits¡,5
The smokehouse burger was delicious! The fries were fresh.  The onion rings are enormous and crunchy.,5
Food and service was excellent highly recommended it,5
What an awesome place. Highly recommend this restaurant  Great food and awesome service. The deep fried deviled eggs are to die for.,5
Made me so sad. Talked it up with our friends who were vacationing with us even splurged on an expensive meal but it did not meet my expectations from previous years. The crab cakes did not have large pieces of crab anymore and they were half the thickness if not thinner.  There was something wrong with their soda machine so even after getting replacement it still tasted off. Went from no syrup to being completely flat. The only thing I really enjoyed was the fried green tomatoes.,3
If you come here you have to try a burger..... everything is delicious including salads but the burgers are amazing,5
This place was packed when we got there. My wife got a Burger and I got a chicken sandwich and we split it. I thought each were very good. The service was good for how busy they were. Beer was cold and excellent.,5
"Food was terrible. The staff was nice although our waiter seemed to not understand any english of what we had said, chef had to redo two steak we wanted medium rare, you cut the center of it and it is COLD AND RAW. disgusting.",2
Great food and service.,5
The salmon was bland. The chicken tenders ok. The fries and coffee were great.,3
"Plenty of parking, very nice set up inside.

It was extremely packed on a Wednesday night, and for a group of 7 we waited for 55 minutes, which was not bad considering how busy it was.

However it took a while for our food to get here. To be fair, the power turned off once or twice for a minute due to weather, which made us anticipate the food even more.

Started off with the Steak Nachos. They were barely room temperature. They were alright, we were all hungry so we munched on those. I decided to get a burger with smoked bacon, jalapeño-garlic aioli, pepper jack, and cooked medium rare.

The fries were big portion, and remind me of Five Guys but with less salt, a good thing.
The quality of burger meat was fantastic, you can definitely tell that it is fresh and local. Everything else was meh. The aioli was barely on there and had little taste, the pepperjack had almost no flavor. I ended up just eating the rest of the patty and enjoyed the tender and juicy meat.

I don’t think anyone finished even half of their plate, it was just average. I think the general synopsis was “it was okay, not worth the wait though”. I was also told by my friends who drank tonight that the Jell-O shots were dry and had more of a smell than actual flavor. “Not worth the $10” they said.

The servers were pleasant and made sure our drinks were filled as quick as they could due to traffic. Probably wouldn’t come back unless it was dead and we didn’t have to wait.",3
Honestly one of the best restaurants I’ve been to  in a while it was really really good!!!,5
I’ve been waiting for so long to try this place and I am thrilled to say it’s a must to visit. It worth the price. I highly recommend to try the onion and ale soup and the roasted beef Wellington.,5
"Dined here for an early lunch. We ordered appetizers and the pub burger. My son had the burger and said it was the best burger he  has ever had. That’s high praise considering he has had burgers from some great foodie restaurants. The rest of us had spinach artichoke dip with truffle, truffle fries, shrimp and lobster rolls, and nachos. The nachos were really good. They were made with fried potato chip and had pickled peppers and short rib! Yum! The bread for the lobster roll was delicious and the lobster shrimp mixture was delicately seasoned and well balanced. The spinach artichoke dip was not too creamy, but could have had smaller artichoke pieces. Truffles fires were served with a truffle aioli and Worcestershire ketchup. They are known for their beef Wellington and braised ribs. We also ordered a dirty martini, which is something I get everywhere. It was delicious! The only suggestion I have is to serve it in a martini glass. My husband had a beer, but I forgot the name and it was very good. Our meal was $170 for the four of us, but it was enough food to satisfy us. This place is worth trying.",4
Most amazing dining experience I've ever had. The food was to die for. The beef Wellington was worth the hype and the price. We ate here now years eve had a set 3 course meal. Had a bottle of champagne to celebrate the occasion. This was a once in a lifetime experience and im glad I got to have it with my husband at this amazing restaurant.,5
Overall it's a good place but nothing extraordinary in my opinion. Food is not bad but is only good/average. Good service and nice selection of beers and other drinks. Nice atmosphere and good to visit for the Gordon Ramsay experience. You should try the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert.,4
"Great service, amazing food... definitely a once in a lifetime experience. Menue matches the restaurant exceptionally well. Was very busy on for a Thursday afternoon, was quite a long line outside, so reservations are definitely recommended. At $100+ person this is definitely an upscale option.",5
"Unbelievable dinner! Beef Wellington did not disappoint.The onion soup was the best I've ever had! Chris was our server, he was busy but we never felt neglected. Can't spend the big bucks like that everyday but how often do you get to Vegas when you live in Florida? Highly recommend!",5
"Slightly disappointed if I am honest. There's nothing wrong with the food, in fact the Wellington was amazing, the fish and chips and the burger was better than average but did not justify the price points. If you take away the Gordon Ramsay name you could get the same quality for about 20% less cost... So good job Gordon Ramsay.
The biggest issue I had was with the service. The hostess was dismissive as we asked for a high table, as ""they are for larger parties"". But when I went to the washroom I saw a row of empty smaller sized high tables, so we asked to be moved to one of them.
The waiter was friendly but slow. Took 10 minutes to take our drink order, another 5 to take the food order. Then the food arrived before we got our drinks. We wanted so much to love this place but the experience made it difficult.

However, faith was restored in the Gordon Ramsay name the next day at Gordon Ramsay's Steak in Paris LV. Details are in my review.",3
"Located inside the Caesar Palace. This place is uneasy to find and foods are extremely terrible. The onion soup is too salty, greasy and cheesy, and hard to swallow. I believe Macdonald’s can make better fried fish and chips than this one. You can even have a bag of Caesar Salad at Costco which is in a much larger size and much better quality than here. The Wellington beef is over-cooked while its puff pastry shell is sticky, soggy, and fully soaked by the meat juice. Extremely disappointed! Don’t waste your money.",1
"This is place is so good! I got their pub burger and it was good. The meat was a little dry, but still very tasty.  My husband got the 3 course meal with the beef wellington. 😋 I highly recommend this if you want to try desert. Its 80$ for a appetizer, dish and desert. The ambience was loud but it was pretty busy. I do recommend making a Reservation in advanced..",5
"Service was great, our server was professional, knowledgeable, and fun. Food was beyond fantastic.  Could cut through my beef wellington with my butter knife. And do yourself a favor and try the nachos. You won't be disappointed. Also, I'm not sure how it's made, but if anyone knows the recipe for the sticky pudding do share it please.  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD good!",5
"Very nice restaurant. The atmosphere was wonderful. There was a plethora of food and drink varieties. The food was delicious and for the portion and quality of food you receive, the price wasn't too bad. A nice place to celebrate the anniversary or have a date night. We were able to watch multiple games on the televisions that they have. It was a high-class restaurant with a high class sports bar feel to it.",5
My husband and I took my mom and daughter out. We celebrated my mom's 75 birthday. We chose to go there. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. They pay close detail to everything. My daughter ordered the beef Wellington and it wasn't quite right and a member of the staff grabbed the plate and took it back before she could ever even touch it. They had only given her half of it and when they brought it back out she had more beef Wellington on her plate. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and the bread they use for dipping was seasoned and tasty. Over all we absolutely loved the place. It is expensive but you get what you pay for. Once in a lifetime experience for us.,5
This place is a hidden secret to get some of Chef Ramsay’s best dishes.  Most people think you have to go to his other places like hells Kitchen or Ramsay Steak but you don’t!  This place is usually easier to get a reservation and it even has his famous beef Wellington.  The kettle chip nachos are awesome.  The best deal on the menu is the 3 course dinner for $80 that gets you pretty much everything you probably want.  I’m giving up a big secret here!!,5
"We made reservations because the other comments recommended it. We were seated quickly, but to get our drink orders completed and greeted by sever it took about 15 minutes. We ordered drinks and food at once. The appetizer came out quickly and surprisingly the nachos were amazing. My husband loves nachos and this landed in the top 5. The beef wellington comes medium rare which is how I always order my steak. Overall it was a delicious meal and would eat there again.
We ordered nachos, fish and chips, and beef wellington.",5
"I've been here twice now and both times my food was exceptional.  Get the Beef Wellington!  It's lick your plate good.  Really good deal on a 3 course meal, the toffey cake with ice cream made was heavenly.

Only issue would be the Caesar salad dressing was not very good and my salad was a little dry.  The croutons are way too big and really dry.  Maybe it's because we went late at night.  Still 5 star!  Definitely get the onion soup over the salad.",5
"I reserved a table through open table, but sat at the bar instead since I dined by myself.
The bartender (Werner) was very attentive, my soda was never empty! I ordered the fish and chips. Super large portion (at least for me)! The fish was delicious, crispy on the outside (even thought the breading was a little thick here and there) and glistening on the inside. The steak fries were crispy as well, tartar sauce good and I actually liked the malt vinegar a lot with the fish and the fries. I didn't care for the peas, but I'm not a pea fan, so there's that.
For dessert I had the sticky toffee pudding of which I forgot to take a picture until I halfway ate it.
It is a very sweet dessert, but oh so delicious. I didn't finish the ice cream, but didn't leave a crumb of the pudding... Now, 2 1/2 hours later, I'm still sickening full from my meal, even though I didn't even finish all the breading and fries of the fish and chips. But hey, gotta live a little once in a while, right?

While the prices are obviously up there because of the name and the location, the food was really good and the service from the bartender was great also. I will definitely recommend and come back next time around!",5
"Delicious food & obviously an expensive dining experience eating at a Gordon Ramsay establishment. Service was mediocre but friendly. Atmosphere seemed rushed and loud as we were seated towards the front, across from the slots and near the small food court. Fun time & enjoyed it with family, but I'd only go once as a Vegas tourist. Gonna try a different Ramsay restaurant next time.",4
Delicious food!  The sticky toffee pudding is not toffee or pudding but it is sticky I suppose 😆... It's actually a FANTASTIC date cake covered in caramel with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  11/10 dessert.  HIGHLY recommend.  The rest of the food was really good too,5
"Highly recommended the 3 course dinner! One of the best Sticky Toffee Puddings I've had in ages!
Great value compared to the rest of the menu and 2/3 the same (the most important 2/3) as Hell's Kitchen for a decent bit cheaper.",5
"It was impossible to get a reservation at the World famous Hell's kitchen so we decided to try Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. I tried the 3 course meal option. Started with a Cesar salad, then had the amazing beef wellington and ended dinner with a sticky toffee pudding! Words can't describe how good the beef wellington was! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to experience Gordon Ramsay's menu but unable to get a reservation at Hells Kitchen.",5
"Little bit of London in Vegas. That’s not a bad thing at all. Honestly, you won’t be disappointed if you decide to dine here. The good choices are great and cooked to perfection.

Let me know what you think. Keep on eating and have fun.

#chicosreviews76",5
"Just ok.

We ordered some appetizers (the ale soup and the spinach artichoke dip) and they came out quickly and were very tasty. However, the had barely started digging in before our mains came and we had to cram everything on the table. Very poor timing. Something Gordon would never appreciate. Our server even noted that it came out too fast. Our server was great and very friendly.

The food. The Beef Wellington itself was super. However it came with cold mash and cold vegetables - which I imagine is something Gordon would also not approve of. My fries with my grilled cheese were cold too. The mac and cheese was gritty and disappointing. The sticky toffee pudding was a delicious finish, but I felt the cake itself was also too cold. The pudding should compliment the ice cold ice cream.

I know this isn’t fine dining, but there should be some better food holding practices and timing from the runners.",3
"We were looking forward to this restaurant experience as part of our Vegas trip. Our server wasn't the greatest, not what I would have expected. The other staff bringing drinks and the food were great and very attentive.

The sides with the Wellington weren't hot, and the Wellington itself was barely warm. It was VERY tender and tasty though. Didn't get to tell the server about it because he came around so infrequently.

This didn't live up to my expectations of a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.",3
The chef’s 3 course meal was flawless! The onion and ale soup was definitely a good way to start the experience at Gordon Ramsay’s Pub and Grill! Beef Wellington cooked to perfection and the Toffee Sticky pudding was unbelievably the perfect dessert. Loved the decor and atmosphere as well! The wait staff were friendly and provided excellent service. We went for a 4pm service which felt perfect because it was the end of the lunch time frame and right before the dinner service at 5pm. Our family loves watching Hell’s Kitchen and we watch Gordon Ramsay’s YouTube channels to learn how to make some of his signature dishes! Definitely will be making reservations at Hell’s Kitchen next trip to Vegas!,5
"Honestly nothing special. We did the prefix  menu.  Beef Wellington was extremely salty on its own and adding an excess amount of coarse salt on the meat did not help(and I'm a person who prefers more salt on food). My partner had to eat the beef on its own adding small portion of pastry each bite due to that.

The carrots that came with  beef Wellington were slightly undercooked which was a surprise.

The only thing that was fairly good was the  dessert and even then it's a pretty big portion that you can split between two people.",2
"Food is great especially the steaks! Don’t skip the sticky toffee pudding. Ask for Sara best server in Las Vegas.

But on our most recent visit the restaurant has a fruit fly problem. We’re being buzzed by them no matter where we sit which is unappetizing.",4
"The food was just okay! Dont expect anything special because you are going to Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant. We ordered nachos, it was good but the burger was just okay. The 2 dollar signs on google is completely misleading. It’s relatively pricey. I paid $42 for a burger and a soda.",2
Great food and good staff. They had lunch and dinner special packages which I recommend! I walked around the shops while I waited for my table but you have to make a reservation.,5
We ate here for the first time.  We sat at the bar and was served by Mike.  Food was amazing as expected and service was top notch.  We had shrimp and lobster roll and spinach and artichoke dip.  Of course drinks!!  Dirty martini was spot on.  Thank you Mike and thank you Gordon Ramsay!!! Shout out to Pablo!!  Whiskey is amazing!!!   Thank you,5
"Out-frickin-standing! Let's face it, you have high expectations going into dining here, and I don't know how they can miss the mark. We made reservations but showed up 15 minutes early and were seated within 30 seconds of arriving. Our server had been there since the opening of the store and was by far one of the best we've had in all of our travels. If I could find someone with that passion I'd bring them aboard all day.

Get that 30 ounce mug of beer.... its bigger than you think but it sure hits the spot! Our table ordered a variety of meals and we all were excited to share with each other. AMAZING! But the Sticky Toffee Pudding.... watch out. Honestly I'd recommend sharing one. It's the best dessert I've ever had but boy, they're going to need a wheel chair to get you back to your room.

Overall, yes, you're going to spend some money... but it's worth every single penny! Amazing experience",5
"Got the 3 course meal and I wasn’t disappointed! everything tasted great, but the beef Wellington was a little too salty for my liking. I still ate it all! Our server Carlos (I think that was his name) was very nice. He gave us an extra toffee pudding dessert so we all didn’t have to share. We do wish the dress code was more enforced. There were people there wearing tie dye shirts.",5
Absolutely delicious. The restaurant has a chill vibe. We sat at the bar and received quick & friendly service. Pictured is the short rib entree and bacon cheeseburger w/ truffle fries. Definitely reccomend.,5
"The food was good. Service was good. Maybe not as fantastic as I expected... the Beef Wellington was beautiful, but ordinary at best. Same for the Prime Rib... it was bland and unimpressive. Just not somewhere I think I'd go again... especially at $100 per person before cocktails.",4
"Let me first say what a huge fan I am of Gordons, so this is just an honest review definitely not meant to be offensive to his brand or name. He is a passionate man and puts that into everything he does so I’m sure he would appreciate my honesty.  The food overall was good, but the portions vs the price were vast. The Caesar salad was bland as were the croutons.  The fish and chips were cold and we had to ask for hot chips. We had the beef Wellington and it was as good as all the positive reviews say. But for $66 we had a smear of mashed potatoes and two small carrots along with a piece of asparagus on the bigger plate. Now I understand the presentation aspect and what caliber of restaurant this is but here’s my qualm-  we split this meal as we wanted to try some of the other entrees collectively. My portion was half of the Wellington served on a saucer- No vegetables or mash.  The short rib kettle chips  were amazing and the pickled peppers made it. The drink I ordered was lovely as was our sticky toffee dessert.  The waitress was very sweet and accommodating with all our requests. The plates and silverware were beautiful. The pub is beautifully decorated and clean. The hostess’s however were extremely rude and even though we had reservations we were refused seating until the rest of our party of six showed up, even though the place was half empty. I get that the tables are valuable and there’s always the possibility of our friends not showing up, hence not needing a bigger table but the restaurant was half empty for almost two hours. They should have offered the option to sit at one of the open high tops- they could have made profit on selling us a few drinks while we waited. This is their policy so unless you want to stand and wait, make sure you arrive with your entire party or kill time gambling. Overall it was still not a bad experience but there’s definitely some tightening up that needs to be done- Chef Ramsay style.",3
"Amazing and simple menu items all cooked to perfection,  located inside Cesar Palace Casino.  I definitely recommend making reservations.  The staff is friendly and fast. I highly recommend this restaurant.",5
"Great customer service. Rosie was a gem 💎 She made sure we were well taken care of up until the point our server arrived. The food was disgusting. Mainly because everything lacked flavor.  Which is not what you would expect from a world renowned stress. We had the fish and chips, 3-Course Meal which included the mini Beef Wellington (gross, it lacked flavor and was super gamey) - clearly, I did not enjoy it. They paired that w/a mash potato medley which was BOMB!! I could have just eaten the side of Mash w/The Onion Ale Soup which was outstanding.  Honestly, the soup was the first course and it was super Delish!! Since I disliked the main course the server, Jorge, was kind enough to replace it with the filet mignon- NOM!! NOM!! Last, but never least, my friend who also had asparagus wanted me to share that her entire meal was not worth it, at all!! In conclusion, the service was above par. Gordon needs to add some more flavor to his foods.  Next time we’ll try Hells Kitchen- fingers crossed that will be worth it.",2
"It was good and very interesting experience .I may agree with other people who said,nothing extraordinary . The menue not too big and fish and chips are the same as in restaurant to go by Gordon Ramsay as well cross the street. I think the bar looks very cool with British like phone booth installations for the TVs.",4
"Well decorated and clean, service was fantastic!
Food was amazing, the burger I had was light and not overwhelming and juicy enough with flavor. Picture perfect burger!
My friend had the fire wings and dam was that good too!! Definitely a must!",5
"Beef Wellington was amazing.
It was worth the wait.",5
We had to send the beef wellington back for being over done but the server was very accommodating and did not bat an eye at the request! The manager even sent us an extra sticky toffee pudding to make up for the inconvenience. I ordered the braised short rib and it was delicious! Definitely reminded me of the types of foods I ate back when I was in London. I was worried the restaurant's appeal would just come from the Gordan Ramsay name but everything was really well done and I was pleasantly surprised.,5
"Temper your expectations. We went here for lunch on a Thursday. 3 of us ordered one dish each, the lobster & shrimp roll, fish & chips and the fried chicken burger. The fish&chips and the fries of the burger tasted like it was done in a pretty refried/reused oil. The lobster & shrimp roll had pretty average filling and the bun was too rich in butter.
If you just want to experience the Gordon Ramsay brand, then go in with average to low expectations.",3
"We wanted to love this place so much. There’s many reasons for the low rating, but the worst was the fact that I found a piece of plastic in my food, and nothing was done about it except “My apologies” and they took the side off our ticket. We were completely ignored most of our visit, I assume because we didn’t look the fancy rich part like everyone else. Eating here was the biggest disappointment of our family vacation.",1
"Went to the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill located
in Caesars Palace for the very first time! Everyone all around enjoyed their meals. I did order a chicken caesar salad and my meal came out with no chicken. They were kind enough to bring it out fast. Our service was not the best. We constantly saw our server taking care of other tables before us. Sometimes would wait at least 15 mins waiting for him to come back to us. Overall great place and experience, expected Gordon Ramsay to have a different outcome.",4
The staff here is delightful and genuinely interested in your experience - even if you're dining alone. The food is always delicious and consistent; just wish they would offer a gluten free bun for their burgers.,5
The burguer is fantastic one of the best. Its so good that I forgot to take the Picture Jajaja.,4
I had a blast. Rodney treated us with the up most respect. My mom got a free dessert. I got the three course meal. It was so amazing and worth it. It was a honor.,5
The Beef Wellington will knock your socks off! Go for the combo if you want to try the onion soup (you do!) and the dessert (you really do!),5
"Burger was cooked medium rare as asked, meat was very tender, melts in your mouth, bun was very buttery, liked the raw onion on the burger. Regular fries were tasty, nice garlic and ketchup dips came with them. Truffle fries were a little bit greasy, regular fries were nicer I thought. Meal was nice, quite heavy and decadent, is a big burger and fries so maybe to be expected. Service was good. Pricey but is Vegas.",3
"One of my favorite places to stop in for drinks and food.  I love the nachos they have and I ask them to add chicken.  These nachos are fabulous and of course with or without an alcohol drink, I prefer with.  I'm not too sure how many times I have ate here and had this same very thing.   Location is in Caesars Palace close to the casino floor",5
"So glad I could book a reservation since most of Gordon's restaurants were all reserved. I ended up getting the 3 course meal, the onion soup was so good, but the beef Wellington was a bit to raw for my taste but staff was so nice and sent it back for another one. The toffee pudding
Was so good almost wanted another one, but I was so full. Definitely would come again.",5
"Gordon Ramsay’s Pub and Grill is a top-of-the-line establishment where you can enjoy any night, on any occasion in Las Vegas! My partner and my experience was absolutely phenomenal. Between the exquisite food and hospitable service, my partner and I were treated like celebrities of the night. Although the staff’s overall service was extraordinary, in particular, I want to thank our good friends DJ and Sladjan for creating a 24th birthday my partner will never forget. You gentlemen have miraculous spirits and a high altruism towards others, and because of that my partner and I will forever appreciate our time shared at your establishment. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in Nevada or visiting the city of Las Vegas👌🏽. Gordon, you should be proud to know your enterprise is in great hands!",5
"Underwhelmed..   we were so looking forward to trying Gordon's Pub.  Husband ordered hamburger, ordered med rare, came out medium to well done, despite waiter promises that they never overcook burgers!  Could just see how Gordon would react to that.  Waiter did take it off the bill.
I ordered fish and chips.  Cod was good but too greasy.",3
"It was such a fabulous experience, great food, awesome desert, couldn't be better!
Highly recommended",5
Fantastic burger and fish n chips. Went to the Gordon Ramsey Fish and chips wasn't impressed. This made up for it for sure! Wait staff and manager were as great as the food. Will recommend and return next trip. BTW the old fashioned was balanced and great with the pub burger.,5
"Wow, simply wonderful. This was agenda item number one for my birthday weekend, and it lived up to the hype. The soup was great, the Beef Wellington was stunning, finished off with a sticky toffee pudding that tastes even better than it sounds. Wonderful service, the drinks were a little slow but the place was hopping and it’s understandable. Highly recommended.",5
We enjoyed our time. The food is of course delicious 😋.  The atmosphere is casual and relaxed. The staff is friendly and caring. They took good care of us. We were able to just relax and enjoy a yummy dinner. We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary tonight. I would recommend trying the 3 course dinner. My hubby said the burger was good too.,5
"We came for dinner service with reservations. Unfortunately, we were full from lunch and did not get to enjoy some of the signature dishes, but we did get appetizers and dessert.

We tried the spinach artichoke dip with pita chips, onion and ale soup, lobster rolls, and the toffee pudding for dessert. The spinach artichoke dip was our favorite. The pita chips were soft, yet crispy, and the dip itself had an interesting tangy flavor; although we could not taste the truffle. The lobster rolls were extremely fresh and some of the best we've ever had. The onion and ale soup had a rich flavor, but the broth was much too salty. The toffee pudding was the real star of the show, and was absolutely delicious.

The service itself was very good, albeit a bit slow. It didn't detract from the experience, and the server was attentive despite having several other large parties. We would definitely come back again to try more dishes.",5
Good friendly service... They should add mixed grill and strawberry trifle.  The chicken Tikka marsala was under spiced and bland compared to normal Indian places. And the naan was under whelming at that price point.  The Beef and chips appetizer was really good.  Overall doing experience was okay,4
"First off, the service was absolutely on point. Our server, Rodney, was attentive, personable, and made great conversation. The food...was amazing. Best fish and chips we've ever had. I tried the Wellington, and loved it! The lunch portions were perfect. I got the 3-course lunch, and it was just right. Highly recommend you eat here if you're in the area!",5
"Super great food!  Loved the Beef Wellington.   My wife loved the short ribs sandwich.  I got the lunch 3 course meal for.... $50ish? I forget, anyways, I was a bit worried if it was enough since the lunch was only half a Wellington, but it was totally enough.   The onion ale soup was spot on!  Best soup I've had in a long time.  The Toffee desert I had at Hells Kitchen and HAD to have it again.  Super delish!!!",5
"Delicious! We only stopped in for drinks, appetizer, and desert. The truffle spinach artichoke dip was delicious. My Old-fashioned was perfect I had 2. The absolutely best dessert the sticky toffee pudding, it's a must of you go.",5
"The serves was so amazing nice, helpful, and mind it to remember!! But the food was everything we thought and more!! Every bit and taste and smiles we got was the perfect experience! 🥰",5
"Oh my gosh, the food is absolutely the BEST. We went as a group of 5 and shared a bite of each other's food. The beef Wellington is a must as well as the lobster pot pie. The sticky toffee dessert was something we fought over.",5
"The host sat us and was fantastic. Not sure if he was the management on duty but he checked on our table a couple of times. He was great. The service was good, but they brought the starters out about 2 minutes before they brought entrees. We had the French onion soup (which was very good, but tasted about how must French onion soup does, nothing special) We tried the nachos and the spinach dip. The spinach dip weren't great. The nachos were. We of course tried the beef Wellington. It was fine, but I don't know what all the hubbub is about. I've had much better steaks. It tasted like pot roast but with a much higher quality meat. The lobster pot pie was the best entree we had, it basically was a lobster bisque pot pie, but had a miniscule amount of lobster in it, for $40, it should include a few ounces. The fish and chips were terrible. No flavor at all. All 5 of us agreed there was no flavor. We then had the toffee pudding for dessert. It was fine, sort of a cakey bread pudding. This was a very pricey meal. About $55 each with tip and no alcoholic drinks (& only 2 regular drinks) and we shared 3 entrees between the 5 of us. So if you're heavier eaters, it's going to be $85 per person for a similar meal. We didn't have an awful experience, but for the amount of money spent and the myriad of options available in Las Vegas, to there are just MUCH better options available.",3
"We are fans of chef Ramsey and we have wanted to eat at some of his restaurants, we could never book a reservation. They are always booked. We are from Illinois, we come to Las Vegas every year! We said you know let’s go in even if we have to sit at the bar, it’s worth coming to sit and eat at one of his restaurants. We sat at the bar and let’s just say the bartender was amazing he made us feel valued as customers, always making sure we were fine. We had to try Gordon’s 3 course dinner and I must say, it was well worth it. We will come back again definitely, I just hope next time we could eat at a table at one of his restaurants. The meal was amazing finally tried the famous beef Wellington, we’ve seen numerous episode’s. The sticky toffee pudding dessert was sooo amazing!! Wow is all I have to say! If your thinking of eating here do it, you will love it!!!",5
"Amazingly delicious experience....and i ate mushrooms without know it and said mmmmm the whole time.... and i hate mushrooms - the taste, the texture, just throws me off. But leave it to Ramsay to create something to fool me on a dish that was soo good I couldn't pick it out. Didn't see it, did taste it, no bad textures. The whole this was so good. I would have livked the plate if I wasn't in public. 🤣",5
This is by far.  One of the best priced and best food / atmosphere you can find on the strip. Hands down. Well Done Chef.,5
"I sat at the bar by myself and truly enjoyed the lunch I had. Great service and a really good sandwich. As silly as this sounds I really liked the ketchup. It was unique in flavor, and really tasty. The price is a little high but it is Vegas and a famous chef, so I would say worth it. The bar tender was excellent and attentive for as busy as it was. If your on the fence, I say go for it and enjoy the atmosphere, located right next the the casino floor.",5
"I sat at the bar and had fantastic service. Ordered the Ale Onion soup, chicken paillard, and toffee pudding.  All 3 courses were delivered quickly to no detriment of the quality. About as expensive as you would expect from a Ramsay restaurant in Caesar's palace. Overall a great experience with delicious food and drinks.",5
"Been here several times and it never disappoints!  UK style gastro pub. Laid back atmosphere , and not as fancy as most of the other Ramsey restaurants in town which is great if your not looking to go all out every meal.",5
"Good day Googlers, my evening at this place was magnificent. I enjoyed a dine in for 2. Getting in was easy for a couple since there were not many who come as a couple. We enjoyed the spinach and artichoke dip to start us of. The pita chips that came with it really added the taste of the dip. I do wish they had more of a crunch to them but delicious either way. I started my main course with the filet mignon which had a lovely smoked flavor to it with a side of asparagus. The asparagus was cooked to my taste which had a nice crunch to it still. My partner in crime had the Wellington and sadly was not overly happy. She felt the outer crust was a bit undercooked and took away from the rest of the dish. The veggies were delish. We finished the night with the sticky toffee pudding dessert and boy was that a great dish to finish everything off. Great experience with the staff!!!!",5
Best food ever!! Service was wonderful. We enjoyed everything.,5
"Came across this place while walking the Vegas strip and always wanted to try a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Wife had the PETITE Beef Wellington(1st time) 3 course lunch special for $57 and she loved it. I had a $27 bacon burger that was perfect. Great food, good service but the prices seemed a bit high for a pub & grill.",4
"Came here as a party of four, with reservations made in advance.

We were greeted and seated quickly without issue.

All four of us are huge Ramsay fans and my wife and I have a nice connection with him as he filmed his hotel hell show just months before we were married there (Landols Castle in Ohio), and we were able to stay in the same room he did, as well as have his recipes catered at our wedding.

I was delighted to find our wedding dish - Braised Short Ribs on the menu and it was definitely what I got, as well as my cousin. The girls got steaks, and, we all had our beers and wines.

The meals were absolutely delicious, as we wouldn't have expected anything less. Service was quick and efficient, and the atmosphere of the pub was extremely nice. Light music, sports on television, sort of loud and clingy but exactly the environment we were searching for- an upscale, but, still relaxing and chilling environment to let loose, share drinks, socialize, and eat some good food.

Our bill for the four of us was somewhere near $350, before tips. While one would think that was quite pricey, while comparing to other nice sit down restaurants in Vegas, it wasn't far more expensive, yet shared a much greater reputation, service, and food, so, I would say fair and comparable for the general area.

I loved the restaurant and my next time in Vegas I would definitely consider a repeat, and or, a stop at one of the other Gordan Ramsay restaurants in the area.",5
"We arrived on time per our reservation. We were seated right away.  The waiter was friendly but not attentive. Our water glasses were never refilled the whole time we were there. They had a limited menu to chose from. The drinks were lacking alcohol. When telling the waiter, he asked what do I want him to do.  I requested he take it back to the bartender.  The drinks returned and were great. We ordered lobster and shrimp roll which was delicious but lack enough lobster and shrimp.(mostly bread).  We than ordered the burger and braised short rib.  They were both cooked to perfection.  The burger included fries.  The braised short rib included mashed potatoes and cabbage. The braised short was really tender.  When the waiter brought us the bill it was incorrect, but he fixed the bill after telling him. The overall experience was good but highly recommend making reservation",4
"I wouldn't expect anything but the best at Gordon Ramsay's, and I was not let down the beef Wellington melt in your mouth, the sticky pudding, absolutely delicious French onion soup was to die for the nachos, absolutely delicious, definitely go to Gordon Ramsey.",5
"We came to have our one ""nice"" meal here in Vegas while we're in town. The food was fantastic and very detailed.  The hostesses were great, welcoming and professional.  The taste and quality of the food were top notch... Gordon Ramsay would certainly be proud!

I rated four stars vs five because of two reasons. I felt that our server was a bit rushed.  He seemed very short and quick to move on. Not so much because he was busy as I saw him talking with his colleagues... there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it's relevant because it caused him to come across as unnecessarily rushed.  Also, the water that was served was maybe a touch cooler than room temperature (no ice), and tasted like tap water.

Overall, I would go back if I were invited, but not out of my own volition.",4
"Great place to have a nice, pricey, but worth it dinner! From the lobster rolls to the wellington, everything was amazing! Be ready to spend about $80.00 per person, everything is worth every single penny.",5
We had high expectations… and really they were met except for the cold mashed potatoes and carrots. The Beef Wellington was amazing and the toffee pudding incredible!,4
The three course lunch was amazing! Soup! Beef Wellington! Sticky toffee pudding! We went for our first meal as a married couple and we couldn't have asked for better. A great day and a wonderful memory that we shall cherish.,5
"Great food, service and ambience. Food arrived a little too fast between courses. Order the sticky toffee pudding - you won't be disappointed!",5
"The food was as delicious as I hoped. The servers were wonderful even though they were short staffed. The atmosphere was what you would except from a pub, loud. The prices were high but not as high as Hells kitchen or Ramsay's steak house. I order the 3 course meal and was very pleased. For an appetizer we ordered the lobster rolls. So amazing and fresh! I would definitely go again!",4
The food I had was a shrimp cocktail and the beef short ribs with cabbage. Both were great. Ordered an old-fashioned It was a letdown. Our waiter was very personable and provided his true opinions about dishes It was quite nice. The dessert was outstanding The sticky toffee pudding. It was a nice Gordon Ramsay experience.,4
Food was wonderful! The wellington was perfectly cooked and the soup was presented so wonderfully and tasted excellent. Sticky toffee pudding with ice cream was amazing as well!,5
Three words.. TO DIE FOR. We HAD to stop as we watch every Gordon Ramsey show there is. We made a reservation and got right in at our designated time. The bartender was great. The food was THE best food I’ve ever had. The steak literally melted in your mouth. I could eat this food all day every day. Highly recommend! Very pricy but without a doubt worth it! Thanks! I’ll be back again one day.,5
Surpassed the hype for us. Food was unbelievable!,5
Came here for my Birthday weekend! Always wanted to eat at a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant. Was gonna give it 4 stars because they served our food to the wrong table so we waited way too long for our meal. But our server took care of us. He comped our drinks and gave us a free desert! Overall excellent service and the food was outstanding! Will be back for sure.,5
I made a reservation for my husband’s birthday. When we arrived they gave us a what seemed to be a 2 foot plank table next to some barrels. I requested that we be moved to a better table it took a few minutes witch wasn’t bad. It took 10-15 minutes for are server to arrive .  I order the lobster pot pie and my husband order the steak medium and water. When we got are water it was warm no ice. 10 minutes or so we get are food my pot pie was fine but my husband’s steak was cooked well done. They did remake his steak but it was still not cooked properly. They never came and asked us if it was better but when are server brought us are check they did comp the steak.So the best part of the meal was not paying for the steak. The reason for the post now is I’m searching for top restaurants to dine at on are upcoming visit.,3
Christopher did a great job serving us. He had great customer service skills. We had the lobster roll which was amazing. We then had the beef Wellington. It was tender and rich in flavor. I definitely would recommend it. The service was excellent and our food came out quickly. We would definitely return. The sticky toffee pudding is to die for!!! So delicious,5
"With all the hype and restaurants of his around the area, I was able to slip into this one and pick up a wedge salad and onion soup. It was a highly disappointing experience to say the least. Service was slow, the salad had barely any dressing on it and the soup was cold. On top of the fact it was over $50 for two dishes. I won’t be going back to any of these restaurants anytime soon. There are far better choices around.",1
"First, the service is amazing! Our waitress asked and used our names the whole time we were there and was so attentive to our every want or need. Second, the food! Come on, it a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Can't get better than that! Amazing",5
"I had been looking forward to this for a long time. We are big fans and I was dying to try the Beef Wellington. It was a disappointment. I did the three course lunch and my husband had a burger and fries. The onion and ale soup came out warm and delicious. The Wellington, the mashed potatoes, the burger and fries..all were cold. The cheese wasn't even melted on the burger. The mashed potatoes didn't have any seasoning and the meat was bland. My husband left half his burger. For the price you pay this was a huge disappointment. I gave it three stars because the soup and the toffee pudding were good.",3
Good good and service. Our fav were the lobster rolls. Great sticky toffee pudding. Fries and chips were just average.,4
"By far one of the best experiences in my many years of going to Las Vegas! Sarah the server from Hawaii is phenomenal! An example of what hospitality is, she was extremely attentive with us and my kids. She has amazing service and just is a beautiful personality. The food was great the drinks and beers were great, Sarah thanks for the amazing experience. Gordon Ramsay if you read this make sure Sarah stays with you forever!",5
"Amazing food, the beef wellington is something you must try here. The 3 course dinner was fantastic and the atmosphere was great. Top quality food, everything was perfect and delicious.",5
A little loud but service was good and food even better.,4
"We were so excited to eat here on our first night in Vegas!! When we got to the restaurant they seated us in the very front where everyone in the casino walks by you. We asked for another table further back to get away from the smoke and traffic. Our waiter told us the back section was closed and they seat people up front first so the restaurant “appears” to be busy. He managed to seat us couple tables in further, which was better, just not the best. We ordered the 3 course meal. The french onion soup was amazing!! The beef Wellington could’ve been better. It was barely luke warm, the potatoes and vegetables were not seasoned at all,  I had to ask for salt and pepper, which took a long time. (Long enough for my meal to go from luke warm to cold). Dessert was sticky toffee pudding, which was rich and delicious!  That was cooked to perfection, and served warm with ice cream. Our server was extremely pleasant, but we were pretty disappointed in the main course. I’m certain Gordon Ramsay would not have been pleased had he been served a cold and tasteless entree.",4
Amazing drinks and desserts but disappointed with main dish! @gordon why would you serve a microwaved chicken curry in the name of chicken tikka masala? Please take it out of the menu.,3
My first time eating here and let me tell you their Nachos are so freaking delicious! Definitely coming back!,5
The Gordon Ramsey Pub and Grill is in Caesars Palace and the décor is open and inviting. Had a reservation and were promptly seated and our server Elyse took our drink orders and explained the menu. I love that you don’t have a multi-page menu where you try to figure out your best shot at experiencing Gordon’s inspiration for the dishes…limited items so you can easily work through the menu. I asked Elyse if a smaller salad was available and she had them prepare me a nice side salad with blue cheese dressing…some of the BEST blue cheese dressing I’ve ever had…so creamy and loaded with chunks of blue cheese. For dinner decided on the Braised Short Ribs and Butter Poached Cabbage with white cheddar mashed potatoes…the meat was fork tender and the flavor of the cabbage was superb along with the potatoes. Seriously good food and exceptional service…wish Gordon would open a place in Nashville!!!,5
Took 3 course lunch and it's so delicious.,5
Sat for a while and no server ever came. 🤷🏽‍♂️ My silverware was dirty and so was my water glass. 🤮..... But... The food was delicious!.. Changed my rating because it tasted so good. Of course you gotta get the beef wellington.,4
"Walked into this pub and the barrels caught my eyes, neat set up, but I was there to eat. Our party of three sat at a high table, waiter brings our menus and water. Glanced over the menu, then we ordered, Nachos, Beef Wellington meal, Fish n Chips and Filet Mignon.  Thought it was strange at $48.00 you only get garnish on your mignon, no sides included. Ok, we’ll wait and taste the food. Our waiter Rodney was an absolute gem. He explained the meals and was very professional.  We waited 10 mins, here comes our salad, that was a meal itself. Very fresh tasting and green. Not like some places, you may get brown lettuce. We are from Washington State, but I insisted we go try this pub. One by one, our meals arrive. I turn the plate, lift it up, smelled the food and then cut into the beef Wellington, holy smokes, my first time trying this and it was amazing. We all shared our meals and the fish was excellent, along with the mushy peas and filet mignon. Mouth watering and very spectacular. We didn’t want to leave. We bought sweatshirts, left a generous tip to our fantastic waiter, Rodney, who was just a delight to have explain everything to us crazy fun fans of Gordon Ramsey. We will return next year. Thank you ❤️💙",5
"Loved it. It was a backup option in case we can’t get a reservation for Hell’s Kitchen, but ended up going to both on different days and it was worth it. My main curiosity was what is the difference between any other fish and chips you can get in the UK, and the meal you get here. It is huge, never had any fish and chips like this before. Though we did make a reservation, on a Wednesday we went it was possible to grab a table on the spot.",5
Typical English. Props for that. Everything came out nice and in trying fashion. The server was over stretched but didn't bother us. Cheers,5
"Great service and great food,  the sticky toffee pudding is my favorite!! Went for a burger this time around and it was delicious! Definitely recommend if you have an appetite!",5
"This place is amazing. Had the homemade short rib nachos and the lobster and shrimp rolls. They were delicious. For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding. Oh my, it was beyond amazing. It wasn't super sweet and it just melted in my mouth.  So worth it.",5
Every time I go it's an amazing meal! And the staff is always ready to help and so attentive.,5
The sticky toffee pudding was out of this world and if I had more. I would have eaten til I was sick it was so good. The beef Wellington was done very well but was missing some of the standards for a Wellington like prosciutto wrap with Dijon but still great.,4
Make reservations if you want a table and no wait. The food was excellent. Pricey but expected and worth it. The sticky toffee pudding is a must try. It was very delicious.,5
"Wait was crazy so we made reservations for the following evening.  Service was lackluster at best and the food was the sunless worst meal we had during our trip. Ordered drinks, apps, 3 course dinner and others. Food was quite disappointing on all levels. Flavor, temperature and execution.  All barely worthy of a buffet restaurant. Nachos cold , old and came out within 4 minutes of order. Clearly trash over ordered and sitting in the window. Wellington not hot,, looked precooked as the pastry had not criped all the way through and was doughy around d the duexelle. Caesar salad no croutons and way too much dressing. Didn't bother to complain, as I just didn't want them to remake it.  but I'll never spend another dollar",1
Always have an amazing dining experience. Food is delicious and the service is superb.,5
I love the idea it's Mr. Ramsey's restaurant. The atmosphere was good. I was not impressed with the service of the waitress. She insisted that we buy a main course. My wife and I had told her that we had already stopped by Hell's Kitchen for dinner. The waitress said we needed to buy a main. She wouldn't take no for an answer. She had told us 3 times that we needed to look at the main entrees 3 separate times. It was our anniversary. We had gotten the brownie with the ice cream on top. It was still not fully cooked on the bottom. We had also ordered the artichoke dip. It was not seasoned. It tasted like there was just cheese and artichoke. The tips of the pita bread were hard like a potato chip. the middle of the bread was soft. I am a huge fan of Mr. Ramsey. I have been watching him since season 1 of Hell's Kitchen. My wife and I were both disappointed by the service. I have been cooking in restaurants for 20 years. It was a disappointing visit.,2
"Absolutely stunning food. The Beef Wellington was so soft it almost melted on my tongue. Save some money and instead of a huge budget for gambling in Las Vegas, treat youself to this restaurant at least once for around 150 bucks for you and your partner. It is worth it.",5
"After watching all of hell's kitchen and masterchef, seeing that beef wellington, I'm just so happy to be able to eat one. It's the best. Ty :'3",5
"Everytime I come to Vegas, I've always wanted to try Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  I finally make reservations ahead of time this time and got in to the Pub restaurant.

We ordered the spinach artichoke and the 3 course meal. The spinach artichoke was delicious.
The 3 course meal, the ceasar salad was a lot bigger than I thought.  It tasted fine. Nothing too special. The beef wellington was delicious. I would order this again. The sticky toffee pudding dessert was delicious but I would not get the toffee sauce. It made it too sweet after a few bites.

The only negative I would say was service was a little slow. Our server was great but it did take a while to get our food.",4
"Overall good time and experience. Wait staff was on point. Hosts were off putting. Dining definitely recommended the 3 course, it's what's worth it. Other than that you won't really get your money's worth. The food did taste great.",3
Our experience here was great. We didn't have reservations for our party of 6. We were told that it would be a 2 hour wait but they suddenly had a table for us. While the restaurant was busy it wasn't packed and they turn tables pretty quickly. The Fish & Chips was outstanding. I would definitely return here when back in Vegas.,5
"Our server SARA treated us like V.I.P! She was amazing and was great at recommending drinks and the best dishes to order.
We ordered the fish & chips and the 3 course lunch special which started with onion soup, half a beef wellington and the sticky toffee pudding! I also had strawberry beer, a must try! Oh my goodness, this experience was beyond our expectations.
The onion soup was so good, I did not want to share it. The beef wellington was amazing and the sticky toffee pudding, wow wow wow I think we died after the first bite, it was heavenly!
Sara, it was an unexpected, top quality experience and the best last meal before leaving Las Vegas. Thank you!

"Not disappointed! Excellent decision to try to find a seat at the bar without a reservation!

The food here is excellent and a great opportunity to try Gordon's famous Beef Wellington without waiting for a reservation at Hell's Kitchen instead. I went with Gordon's 3 Course Menu which consisted of salad or soup (I chose the amazing French Onion soup), the Beef Wellington, and a dessert (Sticky Toffee Pudding).

The french onion soup was on par with some of the best I have had at many other fine restaurants (some with and without michelin stars) -- I would say to choose the soup over the caeser salad. The Beef Wellington is amazing and pairs nicely with a strong, bold red wine. The sticky toffee pudding is to die for and will finish the night nicely.

All in all, while the price is high as some other reviewers have mentioned and you can probably find better value, I think anyone who values good food will enjoy their experience and the food at this restaurant.

I give bonus points for maintaining a ""casual"" environment and not requiring reservations to sit at the bar like some other establishments do!",5
"I now have a new favorite meal…the Beef Wellington. I cannot say enough about this dish. It’s beyond delicious. It melts in your mouth and every bite is shear delight! Go here, get this, you won’t be disappointed!!!",5
"A must for Gordon Ramsey fans and foodies! Started with nachos, then Beef Wellington, and a grand finale of Sticky Toffee Pudding, it was start-to-finish extraordinary! Exceptional customer service (thank you, Taylor!), great ambiance,, and then a walk-off-calories stroll on the Strip. Perfect dining experience!",5
"The service is stellar!!! The bartender (Nick)was absolutely wonderful!! He created a nice rum based drink for me.
Social Distancing:None (bar area or restaurant)
Food: lobster and shrimp rolls...there was no flavor in them at all (not even salt or pepper). The bread was toasted hard and it was not a good contrast for the flavors. I honestly expected more.",3
The lobster roll was very dry with not enough filling. Fish and chips were good. The best thing of this place was service! The waiters were very friendly and helpful.,3
Fantastic service! Incredibly clean! And a wonderful bite! Ramsay pub and grill is definitely one to visit!,5
Such a treat. 2nd visit and I'll be back. Beef Wellington & Toffee pudding all the way!,5
Excellent service I can't say enough about the terrific waiter we had. We both ordered the 3 course meal. Onion soup was good. Beef Wellington was good. The potatoes on the side were cold. I thought the cake was dry. I think once and done with this restaurant.,4
"Fish and chips batter was raw in the center, so that was disappointing, but everything else was great! The stars of our experience were the truffle spinach dip, the beef Wellington, and the fast and lovely service! Also the salted peanut ice cream on the brownie is a revelation.",4
"The food , atmosphere and service was impeccable. Our server was amazing, we chose the wine pairing which was spot on. We asked for the the exact vineyard and she was gracious enough to bring the bottle and show us the label. The onion soup was the best we have ever had. The Beef Wellington was perfect. The dessert was to to live for. I highly recommend Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.",5
"I highly recommend the 3 course lunch with wine pairing. It is a little pricey, but everything in Vegas is. By Vegas standards it is a good deal. The beef wellington is extraordinary!!!",5
"Everything was great except the fish and chips, they kept forgetting to give me silverware.",4
"So I love Gordon Ramsey I watch all is shows and when I had a chance to visit Vegas I went to hell's kitchen, Ramsey burger, and fish and chips to take pics.. but I was super excited to go to pub and order the prefix menu which includes the famous beef wellington... however the first order was luke warm at best and I mean best which was surprising because the sauce was already dried to the plate as if it was sitting on the plate all day then they put the beef on it... it was so dried to the plate I could right my name in the sauce clearly...I sent it back and the next order was a little warmer and the sauce which was surprisingly minimal as if there was a sauce shortage. I can say the beef was cooked perfectly however it was clear it was not cooked to order as I expected at a real restaurant baring his name... disappointment is a understatement. I don't think I will ever go to another famous chef restaurant baring his name again.  I clearly understood that it is just a money grab restaurant attraction with no care or standard of food quality and Ramsey toughts THAT THERE IS A STANDARD!  by the way I'm not rich so to spend over $100 dining alone is a huge stretch for me but I was a fan and they took advantage. Below is a pic I was excited to take when it arrived prior to me examining and noticing no steam and the sauce as described. Oh and the second order had no garnish.",1
Excellent service friendly staff and the food was beyond phenomenal!!!!,5
This place was so yummy!! I didn't get a picture of the lobster and shrimp rolls but oh my gosh the best ever! Everything we had was good.,5
"I got the three course meal for $75. I figured the portion may be a bit smaller since it was THE Gordon Ramsey after all. I was wrong! The Caesar salad was like a large lunch salad. It was dressed perfectly. The Beef wellington was amazing! Just melts in your mouth. The puff pastry was perfectly crispy and the Parma ham added so much flavor to the mushrooms. I wish I had a bit more of the reduction on my plate to get a good swipe with every bite, but that's the only complaint. I was so full wasn't sure if I could even have a bite of the toffee sticky cake. And then this mountainous cake come out! And of course it looked so dang good I had to take a bite. I literally got the chills on first bite. I feel like this is what dessert in heaven tastes like. It wasn't over powering sweetness and it had the perfect spice. I ate about 80% before I could even stop. The only reason I stopped was cause I was so full I could pop. I would def recommend the splurge to get the 3 course meal. It has been one of the few meals that I have said was definitely worth the money!",5
Beef Wellington 3 course meal includes salad or soup and also a desert for $79,4
"We were not familiar with the major traffic along the strip and just getting to the parking lot, waiting in long lines (one of the parking ticket booths were down but no out of services signs indicated) was stressful and time consuming. We called twice to push back our reservations. We hate doing this to any restaurant. The hostesses were pleasant on the phone about our situation but didn't seem to want to hear it.

After finally arriving and seated, our AMAZING waitress Sara S. asked for all of names as she introduced herself. She actually called us by name each time she came around! She made everyone feel special, at ease and at home.

The food did not disappoint. It was amazing from the french onion soup (the best I ever had) , the beef wellington-so flavorful and tender to the toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream!

We will definitely be back and everyone must request to sit in SARA's section. She is the best waitress we have ever had! Sara made this meal a very memorable one for all 4 of us! Chef Ramsay should be proud of her!",5
Amazing food and service! Sarah was an incredible server and treated us like friends; she learned our names! We would return and have another meal next time we are in Vegas!,5
"This place is a must go to when visiting Vegas. It's safe, delicious, and welcoming when you come here. The server I had was quick and very responsive when it came to services. I ordered fish and chips, which was very clean and not as greasy for those who don't like fatty oils. I also love the variety of sauces so you don't constantly get sick of the same flavor over and over. For dessert, I had the toffee pudding and it was phenomenal. It doesn't necessarily have a pudding texture, more like a sticky and moist cake, but the flavor is very concentrated. The ice cream tops it off as well. Definitely will come here again and try out another menu item!",5
The food was amazing. The service was great!,5
"Food was amazing we ordered for appetizer wings, entrée fish and chips, sirloin steak and the bacon burger",5
"As a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen I was thrilled to have the opportunity to eat at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill inside of Caesar's Palace Las Vegas. The outside of the restaurant looked beautiful and the décor inside was inviting.

Unfortunately, I can't say as much for the food. I had the 3 course lunch special consisting of a Caesar Salad, a petite or half serving of the Beef Wellington and a Sticky Toffee Pudding.

The Beef Wellington was utterly underwhelming. After watching episode after episode of Hell's Kitchen I was expecting to have these incredible bursts of flavors like salty pancetta, savory willd mushrooms, a flakey crust and a filet that cut like butter, but that was not the case at all. I actually felt it was rather bland with a soggy bottom.

I did try some of the fries that came with my guest's Fried Chicken Sandwich and I thought they were great and full of flavor. I also really enjoyed the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Since I'm not a fan of toffee I was not expecting to like it so much and have it to be so tasty, but it definitely hit the mark where the other lunch items fall short.

For more food reviews and pictures follow me on Instagram @Aimee.Eats_",3
Food and staff were great! The the sticky toffee pudding was to die for!!,4
"First time eating here after seeing this place for years. The atmosphere is cool. Very nice and spacious. The service was nice.  We had some issues with our food and our server was super nice about handling everything.  As for the food,  it was just okay. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich and it looked horrible.  It was extremely overcooked and served in broken up pieces.  We had to reorder our truffle fries because they came out cold. The fish and chips were good.  Cooked well and had some flavor to it. The best dish of the night was the dessert.  Whatever you do, order the bread pudding.  It's amazing.",3
"Food was casual, but very good. Ambience is nice and relaxed regardless of the ongoing walking crowds in front of you. It’s a fun view of the casino and the decor is trendy English Pub. Service was amazing. Price is steep, but you are paying for a name, as well.",5
"Absolutely everything I thought it would be!
We did the 3 course lunch with the beer pairing. I would highly recommend it! Wish I could take a 5 lb box of sticky toffee pudding with new! Its soooo good.
We went back and had the lobster pot pie . (The Actual name escapes me at the moment.",5
"We made reservations at  the Gordon Ramsey Pub because most other restaurants were booked , so we gave it a shot. Unfortunately the fish and chips were tasteless and greasy and my Caesar’s salad was a poor & cheap attempt .. disappointing… but I must add the GR. Signature Chardonnay was very pleasant!",1
We were lucky enough to get seats at the bar.  Best cocktails ever. Seriously. But the best thing on the planet is the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Speechless.,5
Went there last night ordered oysters on the half shell and prime rib. Stay away from this place. It's not like his new York place. 1st off my oysters were the size of a nickel which was a joke at 6 of them for 25 dollars and then my seared prime rib came out. I looked at the waitress and said so since when is a prime rib seared. She said they had to sear it to get it warm enough. I said ok then I don't want it. She immediately brings out a correct steak. My wife ordered the 50 dollar scallop meal which we laughed at also. It was cooked correctly but she got 1 mushroom sliced into 4 pieces and the end of asparagus stems. We laughed at the entire meal. Stay away from this tourist trap.,1
"The fact that I didn't take but 3 literal pictures speaks for itself. Me and my family was so impressed with the setting and the food that we didn't take our usual pictures (well me). My son had the burger and fries, I had the fish and chips and my husband had the prime rib. The food sounds simple but the taste and the portions were spot on! We got full but we weren't overly stuffed with ""clutter"". The hostess and our server were very professional and friendly.  I hate to leave Vegas but we must move on. Gordon, you've lived up to our expectations!! Great job!",5
Unbelievable food. Great service. The Filet Mignon was grilled perfectly. The Beef Wellington is so tender it melts in the mouth butter.,5
"THE LEGEND HIMSELF BASHES OTHERS FOR USING FROZEN FRIES. WE GOT THE FISH N CHIPS. THE FISH AND TARTER SAUCE WERE DELICIOUS. HOWEVER THE FRIES WERE FROZEN. WE GOT THE BACON CHEESEBURGER WITH FRIES. THE BURGER WAS REALLY GOOD. THE FRIES WERE FROZEN AS WELL. IF GORDON RAMSAY HAD MADE SURE THE FRIES WERE FRESH AND NOT FROZEN, WE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS RESTAURANT 5-STARS. J L WILL PRAY AND WILL BE RETURNING HERE WITH THE HOPES THAT THEY WILL USE FRESH FRIES.",4
I've watched Ramsey for years and always wanted to try the Beef Wellington.  After years of anticipation I finally ordered it and it was everything I expected and much more. You have to try this!!!,5
"Made all 4 of us sick. The beef Wellington was DREADFUL and almost inedible. Cold, completely lacking flavor, the potatoes were dry and bland. The best part of the whole meal was the toffee dessert. $300 later it was definitely not worth it. I’ll stick with just about any other steakhouse in the area next time.",2
"A fourth restaurant by Ramsey Gordon that we enjoy a culinary experience.
Starting with the cocktails through the appetaizers we got to the main courses which were perfect.
The beef bourguignon is delicious as usual and the steaks were done with expertise and extently as we requested.  We pushed the dessert into our stomachs by force but it was worth it.
Beyond what is highly recommended.",5
"We ordered the Gordon’s 3-course dinner. Comparing to the prix fixe course from Hell’s Kitchen, this is totally off. The Wellington beef is not as fresh as Hell’s Kitchen’s. We just had 1 bite then we stopped eating it. The onion and ale soup has a weird taste. The lobster and shrimp roll is just tedious. I would avoid this restaurant in the future. No wonder why this restaurant is only 3.5 star on Yelp. I should have checked it before I made reservation here.",1
"We had lunch here and I have to say I felt like it was a disappointment.  My first complaint is that one side of the restaurant is totally open to the casino at Caesars so it was very noisy and kind of smokey.  My husband ordered a burger and said that it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.  I ordered the fish and chips, and it was just not very good.  The fish was somewhat watery on the inside, and frankly was not as good as fish and chips that I have had at fast food restaurants which was especially bad given that it was about $30.",3
Good food and reasonable prices! Nice staff.,5
Food was 👍good. Service was 👍good. 🍸🧉🥛drinks were 👍very 👍good.,5
"Perfect. The best service I’ve had… pretty much anywhere. The portions were large. The dishes were spectacular. We had the fish and chips, the fish was cooked to perfection. We had the lobster Mac and cheese.. ruined normal Mac and cheese for us. So good. Apparently you need lobster in your Mac and cheese. We also had short rib kettle chip nachos… minds blown. Also we had to sticky toffee dessert… best dessert……. The texture, the flavor… out of this world. But it wasn’t too sticky or sweet. Just perfect. Go here. It’s good.",5
Wonderful pub. Gordon Ramsey delivers on excellent food and quality service. Our waitress was STUPENDOUS! Will return next time in Vegas.,5
Absolutely great place to eat. Great atmosphere and the food was excellent! My daughter was just in awe!,5
"Top notch service, we sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive while still giving us enough space to enjoy our conversation.  Food was amazing...beef Wellington and French onion soup.  Each course came out quickly but timed perfectly, right after we had finished the previous.  The beef wellington was so tender and the soup was bursting with flavor and tasted very fresh.  Manager stopped by and said hi and was very nice as well.  I had a gin and tonic with Hendricks and they are heavy-handed on the Gin...which I appreciate.  Will most certainly be coming back.  This is just what you expect from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.",5
"Food was pretty good unlike service.  Seated for 2 hours 10 minutes, over 15 minutes to get even a drink order in and we never received dessert which was ordered at the start as part of the 3 course lunch/dinner meal.  Dessert was even asked about over 20 minutes before we had to leave to get to a show.  They didn’t seem particularly understaffed but were very disorganized.",3
Some of the best food my wife and myself have had. The truffle fries and shortrib grilled cheese was awesome highly recommend . Wait staff were great and super friendly,5
"Such a disappointing and Unfortunate experience 😕

we ordered the prix fixed 3 course menu with accompanying wine pairings. While still not even half way through our salad and wine, the main course beef wellington & wine showed up which they put to the side of our salads...what the??!!  way too early!  The Phyllo pastry was soft (read soggy) and undercooked, not crispy or hot. We actually didn't eat it as it was undercooked and cold. The dessert was good (is dessert ever bad??) But the supposed port that was served with dessert was NOT port, as advertised,  but simply the exact same wine served with the main course! We pointed this out to the server... you could see it, smell it, taste that it was the same. She Said she didn't know anything about port 🙄

Service was very slow (servers ignored tables while chatting in groups together) even though it wasn't busy in the pub.

We laughed thinking that Gordon Ramsey would certainly be yelling (screaming) at his kitchen AND wait staff here!!

I wouldn't recommend going here at all. If you want to experience a great meal and service, skip his pub and try booking into Hell's Kitchen down the street.",1
"Awesome, not much salt but my beef Wellington was like butter!",5
"It’s our Wedding anniversary and decided to try the food at GR pub & grill. Ordered the New York steak & Beef Wellington with salad and desert but to my dismay they forgot to give my Toffee pudding w/ ice cream. Went back the next day but was still close, there’s no phone to call them directly coz I really am disappointed with what happened. We paid the amount that was charge on us so it’s just right to get what we paid for. Hope you can relay my predicament to them, thanks.the food was good but not complete.",3
"Amazing food and service.  Food is brought promptly by friendly and courteous staff.  We had a Caesar salad (very fresh with awesome dressing), fish and chips and short rib grilled cheese (words can’t describe how delicious they were); all are highly recommended.  Gordon Ramsey and his staff knocked this one out of the park.",5
"The atmosphere was great, the bartender was very nice and the food was amazing",5
My husband are locals of Vegas and we decided to make a nice date night to explore the town. We always watch Gordon’s shows are what is the best thing to do is experience the restraints that he promotes.. it was the best choice!! We had a petite beef Wellington as well as the fish and chips.. all we can say is this is one of the best meals we have ever had. It was amazing to taste such wonderful food as well as the service was amazing! Love our local crew!,5
Everything was better than we imagined. So happy to have dined here for our honeymoon!,5
"10/10 will go here again. The food was amazing, the drinks were good, the atmosphere was vibrant and alive and Chef Michael was great!!",5
"Food was very good despite fairly limited menu (not a criticism,  just a warning for picky parties!) It was also pretty pricey. Lobster pot pie was excellent,  lots of lobster meat, very rich. Will definitely visit here again for the fresh take on old favorites.  Service was very attentive.",4
"had the 3 signatuure dishes. was tasty, but nothing wow. still an experience worth having if you've never eaten at gordon ramsay before. sat at the bar (only place available if you don't have a reservation) and service was great. Pretty pricy (to be expected) but the wine deal is great and well worth having.",4
"Quick service and great food. Went with the 3 course meal of salad, Beef Wellington, and sticky toffee pudding",5
"Great service. Great atmosphere. The food was fresh, delicious and amazing. Will definitely order from there again",5
"Good was amazing!!! But the biggest issue was our waiter. I will not call him out by name but he's lucky he gor the tip I gave him. We were there for an hour and he didn't check on us once after our dinner was served.
One drink my whole dinner.",3
"We were walking through the casino to get to the Forum Shops and decided to stop here for a bite to eat. We ordered the wings and truffle fries along with two beers. The wings were really good, even though they did not bring us the ranch we asked for. The truffle fries were amazing and the best part of lunch. The local beer was nice but $10 for one can of beer is ridiculous. The biggest issue are the Las Vegas casino prices. The food was good but there is no reason for it to cost that much.",4
"A must-visit for any streak lover.
The food is fantastic, savory, and perfect.
The rib eye is tender, soft and full of flavor. Add any of the three sauces, like the peppercorn house sauce, and add even more flavor.
The nachos are just heavenly, with minimal grease, if any, cheese with a sharp bite yet balanced with salt and sweet, thick chips from potatoes.
And the fries are to die for, salty yet not too salty.
Masks are required when you enter and move around, and the staff seam ok with me wearing my full-face respirator. Face shields are optional, as I do see a few guests wear them with their masks.",5
"Was the worst experience. New years eve menu unfortunately so disappointed paid 130 per person for non fresh bread lobster rolls dry chicken and brownie. The risotto tasted like rice pudding, the chicken was dry and all food felt like it was prepared the day before",1
Sadly very disappointed. The truffle spinach and artichokes dip and pita bread was disappointed. Everything else was mediocre. The fish and chips were very disappointed. For $30 I expected fresh cut fries....these look like they just came out of the freezer and had no flavor.,2
Absolutely amazing and delicious!! Beef Wellington was a 10/10,5
"Service was good. Food was okay. I took away that the price for the experience was too high, but I recognize it is a GR experience..",3
"Excellent experience overall. There’s 4 in my family but only 2 seats available via online reservation. I approached the receptionist and requested 2 additional seats. She promptly accommodated us. The starters were super good. The Beef Wellington was exquisitely delicious. We’re going to try all 5 of the Gordon Ramsey restaurants in Las Vegas. One down, four to go.",5
We were told it would be a 45 minute wait but was seated in 20. Yay! Service was great. Food and cocktails looked and tasted amazing.,5
Wonderful experience! Lunch was amazing and service was just as pleasing. Always enjoy our time in the Caesar Placae and the dining ambiance,5
Ordered fish&chips and for myself Ordered grilled pub burger and for dessert had sticky toffee pudding everything was delicious  i will be coming back next time I'm in Vegas,5
Only reason it gets 1 star is because the beef wellington was fantastic. Mashed potatoes were cold and flavorless. Lobster mac was cold and flavorless. Garbage tier.,1
"It's really a challenge to justify over $6 for a cheeseburger let alone $20 but Chef Ramsey comes very close. Maybe if there were something unique for flavors or adding rosemary and garlic on the fries? Just give it an extra pop that no one else is doing... In fact, his Hells Kitchen burger is the best I have eaten at a restaurant,  then his pub burger comes 2nd. If the Vegan burger was black bean based instead of soy,  that would be my favorite,  and no I don't like the impossible burger. My wife and I enjoyed the food and service here and we will be back.",4
"This was the $40 chicken dish.  A chick fillet sandwich without the bread.  Hands down, the biggest culinary disappointment In my 59 years.",2
"I had a truffle spinach & artichoke dip to start(havarti cheese, spinach, fried pita chips). Then a grilled pub burger(english sharp cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, fries). Then for dessert I had a chocolate brownie (pretzel chips, salted peanut ice cream). It was all amazing Gordon Ramsay's restaurants never disappoint me.",5
In my opinion this was way better than hell's kitchen in Lake Tahoe,5
It was so good the servers were very nice the food was excellent had a nice atmosphere and it was not expensive next time and I am in Vegas I’m definitely coming back.,5
Great food and service.  What you would expect from a Ramsay restaurant. Don't expect to get out cheap though for 2 people was 200$ but the experience is priceless.,5
I am a fan of Gordon Ramsay. You have to visit this place. Every time I try to order new things and it’s all fabulous. Thanks for the good food and the good service.,5
Food was amazing. Only issue was main course came out while I was still working on my appetizer and soup.,4
As expected. Got in fast and food was delicious as always.,5
Presentation was very nice. Flavors were as described as staff was friendly. Not my style of food. Not too spiced or seasoned so didn’t sit well with me. But I appreciate the flavors and the menu very well explained the food upon arrival.  Soup was amazing. Also tried the fish and chips which came out near perfect.,5
"Really Disappointed, love Gordon Ramsay and love that on kitchen nightmares  he teaches restaurants how to provide great service, I made a reservation and was super excited to eat at one of Gordon’s restaurants for the first time. Unfortunately after being seated and watching multiple servers walk past me for 15 minutes without even saying hello or giving me and my table a glass of water we had to leave. If Gordon had been there that night I’m sure some people would be filing for unemployment. Dreadful experience, what a joke.",1
"As per the suggestion of the bar tender and server, I tried the new York strip steak and mind you it was THE BEST steak I have ever had",5
Food was good (we had fish &chips and the Wellington meal) and the service was also good. Would come back again,5
What can I say about this place that hasn’t already been said. The food was awesome.,5
Just went and the steak was 100% better amazing texture as the last time I went but a lot less salty. If your in Vegas and want a really good meal go here for the 3 course. Delicious!,5
the Lobster roll was excellent....also the fish & chips 🍟 was outstanding....good food all-round....fast fresh food 😋,5
"Nice place to eat while at Caesars. The food has a delicious flavorful taste. I enjoyed the experience and would definitely recommend eating here. We sat on the edge next to the Casino , enjoyed people watching.❤️ Love Vegas.",4
Our server Sara was the BEST! She was so nice and was very knowledgeable other entire menu. We arrived 30 minutes after opening so it was quiet. I had a boddingtons and the 3 course lunch and my partner had the 12 ounces steak with weihenstephaner. Every thing was out of this world delicious. It was an honor to be in the presence of great company and outstanding food! Wish I could give 6 stars!,5
Great atmosphere. Staff is friendly. Food is dell delicious and not too expensive.,5
"The food was great. The waiters could have been a little more attentive, though. I felt a little rushed but I would go back because the food was so good!

Edit: ate here a second time and the burgers were amazing. I believe they make their ketchup in house. It was really good. Also, the white Cheddar mashed potatoes are a must.",4
Food was good there the chicken sandwich and coleslaw I had was fresh my partner had the fish and chips that wasn’t bad neither. Our server Rodney was awesome and simply personable.,4
Amazing food. Had the prix frie menu. Best French Onion soup I've ever had. The Beef Wellington was perfect and fig cake dessert was heaven. Ronnie gave great service at the bar and this was a highlight of our trip,5
OH MY GOODNESS!!! There is a reason this man has so many James Beard awards!!! Worth every $$$,5
The Fish and Chips were outstanding.   The Beef Wellington was amazing.    My absolute favorite part of the meal was the sticky toffee pudding.,5
"Great experience, in particular the lobster and shrimp roll, and the short rib nachos",5
I think Gordon Ramsay needs to visit and overhaul his own pub. This meal was average at best. It started when we tried to order a beer and 4 different brands were unavailable. Then our food came before our drinks arrived and my husband beer never arrived at all. I had the Lobster Pot Pie and it was more like lobster flavour pot pie. My husband had the fish and chips and he was very underwhelmed. The one bright spot was our server who was doing her best. I would skip this restaurant when in Vegas.,2
"This was a restaurant that I knew I had to try while I was in Vegas. The famous name that the restaurant holds, I thought I was going to be in for a treat. How wrong I was. It hurts to say this but the food was OK if this was a little hole in the wall pub. I had the fish and chips and was so disappointed.  The fish batter lacked any flavor, the fish was overcooked. The pea dip was really bland. The saving grace was the tarter sauce . The chips were good. I would say, save your money and go elsewhere . #heartbroken #customer #fan",3
"Had a great time here, food is superb and Sarah is such a darling!! Keep her!",5
This is a wonderful place for lunch dinner drinks... It's Vegas and Gordon Ramsay.... Bring your wallet... Will come back again and again,5
"We had to send back the checking sandwich because the meat was chewy.
The wedge salad was great, the onion soup was delicious. Great beer selections.",3
My husband and I had the most pleasurable experience at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. My husband enjoyed the beef wellington and I enjoyed the New York Strip Steak and all we could say after each bite was Amazing!! The Steaks were cooked perfectly.,5
Aside reading all this review looks great. But our experience wasn’t what suppose to be the Fish and Chips we ordered looks fish not fully cooked and the battered not fully cooked from the inside. After dinner  went back to hotel give me upset stomach the entire night.,3
It's pub and grill food. It's no hells kitchen. Presentation was on point. Beef Wellington was overrated. Maybe we had too much expectations. Came on a Monday. It was packed still.,4
"5 stars in every way.  Service, ambiance, food, everything was just amazing",5
"Very look forward to Gordon’s kitchen!
We tried set menu and wine pairing, stake and desert were not disappointed us, however wine was coming too late😌",4
Had a quick drink and couple of appetizers. Did have a large piece of lobster shell in our lobster rolls.,4
"Just finished up a week in Vegas.  I ate at the Pub & Grill every day there.  It was amazing.  There are simply no other words than amazing.  The service, amazing, the food, from the moment they set it down in front of you is amazing.  The smells coming off of each meal before I took my first bite were unbelievable.  The third time in they actually delivered the wrong sandwich to my wife.  The waitress took it back and they quickly fired the right thing and she had her correct meal in less than five minutes.",5
Dinner was pretty good they got our order incorrect and forgot a salad. Food was not very hot fries were cold and soggy not exactly what I expected from a Ramsay restaurant but the flavors were on point.,3
"French onion soup.  Beef Wellington, Fish & Chips with smashed peas and sticky toffee pudding for dessert.

Everything was spot on and our server was just fantastic to round out a really great lunch!!",5
"I’ve been watching Ramsay cooking shows and samples for several years. Being able to be here and taste his 3 course cuisine, it did not disappoint. Definitely recommended",5
"Awesome awesome, awesome food. OMG........ Everyone has to try it because it's so good",5
"I had a great time at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill, I had the onion soup and it was excellent, the new york steak was cooked perfectly and béarnaise sauce was an excellent choice of sauce, and the piece to resistance was the sticky toffee pudding it was the bomb, I highly recommend you try these items",5
"We tried to eat dinner here a few days ago and had to leave as there weren’t any vegetarian main options on the menu.

There was a veggie starter but no veggie main.

Absolutely baffling in the year 2021.",2
OMG!! The best meal I have ever had! HANDS DOWN! We had the 3 course meal...the onion and ale soup was just amazing! Then came the beef wellington...I have never had it but it was delicious! There isn't a word in any language to accurately describe the delectable food that we ate. You NEED to try this! Bravo Mr. Ramsay!!,5
Excellent service and tasty food. Really decent beer selection. We had the lobster roll and truffle fries and it was the perfect mid afternoon snack!,5
"Gordon needs to visit in disguise and sit near the bar so he can see all the food going back to the kitchen and left on the table.  We waited an hour for Beef Wellington, it was served COLD. We sent it back and received a hot but bland blah meal. The Prime Rib was tasteless. Dinner at Waffle House would have been better. We were warned as we waited to be seated by someone leaving that we would regret it. We did, sorry,  never again.",2
"I went with great expectations and was left deflated by the reality. Good, not great. Service was superb but food was blase. Another mystery...the photos posted here show BOTH halves of the Wellington being served. My husband and I both received one half portions. Hmmm...",3
Wonderful food and service. Specialty crafted cocktails are amazing and the lunch portion of Beef Wellington is perfect!,5
"I bet you a million dollars Gordon Ramsey has not set foot in this place ever once since it opened... Their signature dish, we were told, is the fish and chips... so the three of us ordered fish and chips... and what we got was the most ordinary of fish and chips you can get. The fish? seriously tasted like every other fish in a fish and chips dish I have ever eaten. The chips? (fries) were under cooked so there's that... it's OK, don't get me wrong, you will not go home starving. The food is eatable and will not disappoint (too much)... but for a celebrity Chef like Gordon Ramsey to put his name on a mediocre noisy pub in Vegas, I was expecting a touch more (and if you're reading this Chef Ramsey, time to refresh the kitchen crew knowledge about how to make a decent Coleslaw as well). I guess if the place was just called ""a Pub"" I would have given it 3 stars for its mediocracy but given I expected more by way of pedigree, it gets 2 stars.... Bottom line: If you do not expect much you wont be disappointed.",2
"The Hell's kitchen restaurant was booked out for months but the Grill and Pub was able to seat us last minute with no problem. This is a relaxed atmosphere. Come as you are and enjoy great food. It is pricey but, hey it's Gordon Ramsay. The service was lacking. The waiter took our order, brought the food and never came back. We had to flag down another staff for drink refills and to get the check. The food was amazing! The taste combinations were a fantastic surprise. I will definitely be back if I get the chance. Hopefully with better service the next time.",5
Definitely the place to go if you want a little taste of each of the ramsay Vegas restaurants. They have something from each on the menu but at a more fair price. Everything is so delicious. Highly recommended.,5
Food was good but not great. Prices were insane! A wedge salad was $19 and main dish is $40-$60. Be aware the portions are small for the money spent and the food is sub par compared to the hype. Not sure why the guy gets all crazy with cooks on his show while the restaurant can’t even cook a filet. Order filet and literally all you get is a piece of small meat.,2
"4.5, wife insisted on a place with good food while staying in Caesar Palace. Ended up at Gordon Ramsay. Special for the night was beef wellington, should have ordered that! For appetizer we got pigs in a blanket, not what I was used to and a bit disappointed. I was expecting to get sausage rolls, ended up with sausage links wrapped in pastry. Got the Fish and chips with side of smashed peas for the entree. Nothing too special, fish was done properly, crispy outside and flaky inside. I guess I was expecting a lot more from the visit. Felt like going to the pub next to our home expect paid double for food!!!!",4
"I found it a good place to dip my toes into the myriad Gordon Ramsay properties in Vegas to see if it lives up to the hype. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, and not surprised at all by the prices. Would absolutely visit again, though.",5
"To start off, coming here you will require a reservation,  if not expect to wait in line. Seating is comfortable and the seasonal drinks are smooth. The three course meal is very filling enough for two. You will not regret eating here, the food will make you forget about the price. This is one top stop you should make coming to Las Vegas.",5
The food and drinks were incredible beyond expectations! I highly recommend giving it a try!,5
Beef Wellington. Lovely!,5
"Atmosphere is nice. Restaurant is clean. The beer choices are good. I had the fish and chips,  mushy peas are good. Good battered fish and crispy fries.",5
So not worth  it! I was so disappointed with their food. The menu did not have that many options and the food is way over priced. I will never go back there again. And I highly not recommend it. Worst restaurant ever,1
"Everything you'd want from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, pub / comfort food style.",5
Great food and service.,5
"Enjoyed lunch today at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. We both enjoyed the 3 course meal, which is French onion soup or Caesar salad, GR's famous Beef Wellington, and sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The Barrel Aged Old Fashioned, and Cereza de Mule were nice afternoon vacation cocktails.
As we dined before 5, we got lunch pricing, which is an incredible deal. Our server, Katie, I think was her name, just amazing. Just the right amount of attentiveness. Definitely make a reservation, they're busy busy, and only able to seat half the restaurant right now.",5
"It would be easy to go on and on about the great food, but I’ll start by thanking them for their excellent customer service. We came in five minutes after closing because we thought they were open until eleven, and I had my elderly father with me, and the next nearest restaurant was too far for him to walk, so they were nice enough to work us in. We were so grateful.
Now, onto the food. The fish and chips melted in your mouth. The braised short ribs also melted   off your fork. The cocktail shrimp were seasoned perfectly. The spinach artichoke dip had delicious cheese, and was melted to perfection. The lobster rolls were delicious and delightful. Truly a great restaurant.",5
"Below average. Made reservations for my birthday and waited 15 minutes after reservation time to be sat, watched others walk in and be sat before our group. I ordered a New York strip medium rare and it was well done. The server didn’t follow up until about 15 minutes after food was delivered so re ordering was pointless. Server was inattentive however the water guy was very nice and attentive. Decided to split our bills and what looked like the manager gave a glare and waited at the front as we walked out without saying thank you or anything. Disappointing for how much the place cost and for wanting to visit a Gordon eatery. Would not return.",1
Was not that impressed.  Food is way over priced.  It gave me and my friend stomach problems after we ate.  Staff was friendly.   About $100 per couple.,2
"Well worth the experience of saying I ate at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Not worth the price. I like to watch his tv shows, but honestly you can purchase just as good of food in other places. Even a non aspiring cook with absolutely zero culinary ambitions, like myself, can do as well at home. That said, go ahead and go. I'm glad I had the opportunity to do so.",3
I had the 3 course meal and it was awesome. The restaurant is pretty busy so it is better to make a reservation.,5
"Its was absolutley delicious! My party sat at the bar, the bartender, warner, was a wonderful host to us! The drinks where delicious, as well as the appetizers!",5
Fantastic food the nachos are amazing. Had a great experience,5
Prime rib was 5 star!  Service at the bar was great,5
"Loved it. Price was to be expected, service was very welcoming, and they were very accommodating since I was eating alone.
The 3-course lunch menu was delicious!
The sticky toffee pudding was my favorite part. Would definitely return on a future trip to Vegas.",5
"Very disappointing 😔. Have been to Ramsay's restaurants in US and UK, this was worst experience. Food was cold, salad was over dressed. Will not recommend",1
"I gave it 4 stars because the burger was good.   Fish and chips not so good....nothing to write home about.  Batter was not seasoned, very bland. Looks better than it tastes.   I'd give the fish 2 stars.",4
Had NYE dinner.  Food was good. Everything in Vegas was pricey.,4
"If we're being honest, kinda feels like Ramsay phoned this one in. A collection of easy comfort food dishes from his other restaurants, quickly assembled in a pub setting, all at premium prices. Nothing really new or creative on the menu, and honestly a bit overpriced for the experience. I'd love to see Gordon either redo the menu/concept and add some originality + effort, or take his name off it. Regardless, service was really good and the staff professional. Food prepared to order, if uninspired.",3
"Good food not GREAT...I  think you would be satisfied with the meal I most definitely think it is over priced for ""good"" food.",4
Food was absolutely delicious. Service was a little slow though.,4
"Great service, nice atmosphere,  and the best wings I have ever had.",5
"Food was awesome, service and atmosphere can't be beat",5
The staff is friendly and caring. They took good care of us. We were able to just relax and enjoy a yummy dinner.,5
Very disappointed. Wellington was overcooked and bland.  Breading falling off the fish and chips.  Definitely not worth $120 bucks.,3
"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent! The service was the best we had during our stay in Las Vegas. I had the fish and chips. It came out hot a was very good. The atmosphere is like a pub in Britain. The stickey pudding was and awesome ending dish. Visit Caesars and try it out for good easy dining.",5
"Service outstanding from the hostess station to the bar where my husband and I had dinner. We love Gordon Ramsay so we decided to dine at one of his many establishments. My husband had the filet mignon with cream spinach and he absolutely loved it. I selected a Gordon's Favorite Fish & Chips knowing it would be the best... unfortunately it was just ok, the fish had no seasoning but the fries were very salty. Overall it was good experience.",3
Short ribs Nachos was super delicious 😋 Ari the new server provided great service he knew what he was selling.👍.,5
Absolutely 💯 delicious place to eat!! Definitely coming back again to try their steaks !,5
I’m doing 3 stars which is shocking for me because I follow a lot of Gordon Ramsay recipes. I was pretty disappointed in the food. I had ordered the beef Wellington with the French onion soup. The French onion soup was a little strong but it was amazing and it was probably because it was my first time ever trying it. I figured I’d try it out since it was Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant! (: When I received my beef Wellington it was beautiful and cooked to medium rare perfectly but it was cold. It was also bland to me which was disappointing. I was super excited to go to a restaurant of Gordon’s. It was worth the experience but definitely not coming back. Our waiter was also amazing but I wish the food was too.,3
"First off I wish the I remembered the servers name.  Chinese guy,  been there for 10 years or so. Hands down flawless. Story's told where fun.  Food was great.  Amazing.  I will definitely eat here again and again.",5
"By far a must try. I was so disappointed with the steakhouse at the Paris that I wasn’t planning on coming here. But we were staying at the Ceasars Palace for the night and it was was conveniently located downstairs. We didn’t have a reservation but we’re out on a waiting list and by the time we checked in we got a text to come downstairs. My cervesa mule was to die for ($18). I ordered the 3 course meal; Cesar salad, beef Wellington and dessert. I can’t even describe how amazing it all tasted. I will definitely come back on my next trip to Vegas. Only down side is that there isn’t a vegetarian selection. Even the Cesar salad had some anchovies ingredients that did not make it vegetarian friendly.",5
"It was such a disappointment. I really expected way more. The burgers was just NORMAL, not even good. Dry meat no flavor at all.

I really don't want to talk about filet mignon, you pay $60 for dry bad quality meat.

It was just Surprisingly BAD.😒😒👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",1
"I took test menu.Food was good, but does not worth this money. I expected more sophisticated desert, rather than plant biscuit even without filling and piece of ice cream. Steak was good, scallop contained crunchy parts, but still ok. Waiter was nice, environment is fine, but not excellent, tables stay too close. I think 4 stars is fear estimate considering all the factors. I did not understand why they gave me the paper bag with menu at the end of the dinner. Otherwise, it was pretty good experience.",4
A very lovely dinner.,5
"Awesome place inside Caesars Palace, Las Vegas. We went for dinner, I recommend to make reservations the day before coz it gets very busy especially on the weekends.

#fishandchips",5
"The nachos were nice, the burger was disappointing, the meat had no taste, the bun was dry. Overpriced!",3
This is a great restaurant five stars definitely the water was amazing spring water and reasonable price,5
"So happy to finally make it to this restaurant!  It was St Patrick's Day and covid, so we had to sit at the bar.  Dave was the bartender and he was that x factor ingredient that made the visit one I won't forget.   The fish and chips were phenomenal, and matched my high expectations.  This is a pub and not a high end Ramsay establishment, but it felt like everything he puts into his shows was visible here.  Simply exceptional.",5
Excellent service. Drinks were great. My fried chicken could have benefited from a dash more salt and some heat.,4
"It was just okay. Bloody Mary came with no celery, olives, salt rim, or anything else. Just tomato juice and a lime.  Wings were really good; the best part of the meal. Short rib grilled cheese left a lot to be desired. Bread was soggy, cheese wasn't melted and hardly any there, TONS of the pickled onions, and short rib was fatty... you could tell the sauces served on the side were old because they were crusted over on top. It tasted like something I would get at a $5 sandwich shop. The server did not even acknowledge the fact that I disected the entire sandwich and only ate bits and pieces. I definitely expected better from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.",2
Great food and great service. It is a more casual setting.,4
"Absolutely loved it. Our waitress Sara was awesome. The beef wellington, onion soup and sticky pudding definitely lived up to the hype. And that Avon Came Upon Sin was fantastic. Gotta try another of the GR locations on the next visit.",5
"Visited here for my honeymoon, wasn’t sure if we wanted to eat here and asked the hostess what was good on the menu before asking for a table! Gabriella was so kind and knowledgeable! She suggested the beef Wellington and sticky cake for dessert.. she also congratulated us on being newly weds!! She was so sweet and made the experience awesome!!!",5
"My friends and I were just at the Pub in Vegas @Ceasars, while the food was absolutely 💯👌amazing, the restroom was a whole different story! Very dirty and unmaintained for such an establishment. However my meal was fantastic but my stomach as a bit turned after using the restroom to wash my hands before eating. I know @gordonramsay wouldn't have approved.

BTW the lobster roll and truffle 🍟fries were on point.",4
Loved our hamburgers! The portions are very nice! The beers were cold and our service was spot on. I would recommend it to anyone that loves hamburgers and fries!,5
Charming waiter. Delicious food. Great service.,5
"Great food inside the Ceasars casino.
Casual ambiance , completely pub style has always  seating not like HK that one must book week in advance.
Recommend  their special filets inside a pastry filled with mushrooms  and the filet . Also special dessert  is great.",5
Great burger with a gluten free bun! I recommend it!,5
"Always a pleasant experience.  Love the food, which is always perfect. Highly recommend the short-rib nachos, though everything is superb. Service was friendly and prompt. No complaints, favorite place to eat in Vegas.",5
"Staff was extremely rude. All of the hostesses kept ignoring me and my party, all of the servers were walking around and watching our table that had nothing not until almost 8 pm. My reservation was at 7:30, but all of the other tables got served and acknowledged. None of the servers even came up to our table to give us water or anything. We felt neglected and because it was a corner table in the front, the servers would think that someone took care of us already but no one did. We even walked up to the servers and asked if there would be a server that would help us and get ANYTHING. We even called for the manager and he was pretty considerate. He told us that he would find out which server completely neglected us, he also gave us his business card to reach out to him for future inquiries with other Gordon Ramsay restaurants. We’ve been to the rest of the restaurants and we NEVER had this problem except for today. Respectfully, the service was not appropriate. Wish I could have given zero stars. We still don’t even know who our server is and what their name is…",1
"Great dining experience in Vegas. The atmosphere is modern and lively, very open and facing the casino. Some might consider it noisy... but do you go to a pub if you want privacy? I had the 3 course menu. Started with the onion soup, which was good but lacked a piece of bread to eat with, then the fantastic beef Wellington, cooked to perfection with a fantastic puff pastry around. Dessert was a delicious sticky toffee pudding with icecream. Portion are generous, bur the high quality of the food does not make you feel stuffed. It is definitely not cheap but not overpriced either - aligned with upper end Vegas prices for similar food and location. I would east there again when I have the chance. Highly recommended",5
"Appetizers came out before drinks, all entrees arrived one minute later. Wanted a card to pay the check without showing us the check. Service really sucked and they just tried to rush us a a fast as they could. Better options in Vegas.",1
"Literally one of the best restaurant that I even never visited. Very nice service, amazing and delicious food and most important you fell very comfortable.",5
It was a fun place. Good food. Strong drinks.,5
"Our server and helper were great, very personable and friendly.
I ordered the chicken Caesar, which was much larger than I expected but it was delicious.
Would recommend both the place and the meal if you're okay paying a little bit per person.",4
"I was there on Sunday September 19, 2021.  I had another awesome experience.  Whenever in Vegas we ALWAYS stop here and Fish and Chips.
The place is just amazing.  Our host was Christopher who made sure our meal was everything we hoped for.
I highly recommend this place.",5
"We were glad to find a place open after 9pm, but disappointed in the service and the pub burger.  The burger was bland and the gluten free buns we had read about online were not available.  The lettuce wrap substitution was pretty sad...  we have seen better at Wendy's.  On the plus side, the truffle fries were quite tasty (even if we had to order them twice and they showed up halfway through our entrées).",3
"My first time visiting this restaurant already visited Gordan's Burger restaurant so I gave this a try with my sister and brother. The Lobster Roll was seasoned really good I'm a big fan of lobster so that was worth it, the Short Ribs Nachos was great everything was put together nicely. The Beef Wellington was excellent and the Burger was a plus. Dessert was amazing the Toffee Pudding was delicious overall the experience was amazing the wait time for our food was at a decent time period our server Carlos was great made sure we were served and welcomed, Chef Mike came out to ask about the food told him the kitchen did a really great job and so did him to make sure the food came out right, I'll definitely come back in the future great restaurant! This place deserves more than 5 stars!",5
Great Place Fantastic Food We had the pleasure of being served by Eden she was such a nice person very attentive and we also had the pleasure of meeting the manager Jason  what an awesome person if you are in this area I recommend you come to this restaurant ask for Eden & Jason they will make you feel at Home.,5
The food was fantastic and the service matched.,5
"Mmmazing! I had the 3 course lunch consisting of Cesar salad, Beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding. Out of this world delicious and cooked perfectly.",5
"My husband and I each got the three course meal with soup, beef wellington, and sticky toffee dessert. We were seated promptly at our reservation time, and our waitress was very nice. We both enjoyed the soup, but the beef wellington definitely stole the show. The beef melted in your mouth...I found myself closing my eyes with each bite because it was so wonderful! I read other reviews and agreed with two things - the beef wellington is definitely a salty dish (it has salt sprinkled on top in addition to whatever is inside it), and one of our wellingtons was a bit cold. However we decided not to sent it back because in the process of determining it was colder than the other one, we each had a couple of bites and decided it was inappropriate to send back a half eaten meal. I am certain that they would have remedied the situation had we mentioned it, hence me still giving 5 stars. Plus even luke warm the beef wellington was still amazing (I took the cold one so my husband could enjoy the meal he'd been gushing about for weeks). We preferred this sticky toffee dessert to the one we got at Gordon Ramsay burger and left absolutely stuffed. Overall really enjoyed the food.",5
"Well… the food is great but unfortunately everyone in my table got their food and after all were finished, my plate arrived (the Wellington steak) by that time and after asking the server for my food twice I wasn’t even hungry anymore, they gave me a free dessert for the inconvenience but come on for that type of a pricey restaurant that shouldn’t happen, anyway my first and probably last experience at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant",2
"Had the shrimp & lobster rolls, prime rib, white cheddar potatoes & toffee pudding.

Favorite dish was the lobster rolls & prime rib! Would recommend just for the lobster rolls, they were THAT good!",4
Place was straight junk. This is not a true pub. Ordered the hot chicken sandwich. Fries were dripped in oil once they came out. After a couple minutes fries were very dry and crispy. I asked for bbq sauce they didnt have any. Coleslaw and chicken in sandwich was dry.(chicken dry/coleslaw not saucy enough)Very disappointing for such a big hype. Ive had much better. Wont be going back.,1
It was ok. Wouldn’t go back but at least we had to experience the great Gordon Ramsey food and restaurant,3
"Limited menu, soup and salad was so-so/okay. Fish and chips were excellent.",3
The food was to die for!! Our waitress was super sweet and fun! Best Birthday ever!!,5
"The waitress was wonderful the food so so. The fish was super greasy and fries soggy and not done. The shrimp and lobster roll was bland and had too many lobster shells, almost broke my tooth. I would not suggest this place especially for the price.",3
Excellent food that you'd expect from the name.  A cozy casual atmosphere that's not too stuffy. A perfect come as you are place. The service is excellent and puts you at ease from start to finish. Definitely get reservations if you can.,5
I was disappointed after waiting so long to try one of Gordon Ramsey’s restaurant. I am a big fan so I had high expectations. Gordon should do undercover boss to check on his restaurants. The fries were cold and hard and the ice cream for the desert was completely melted. I expect more from the reputation.,2
"The Beef Wellington was the greatest meal here. Must try if you come. Service was great, a little pricey for such a small portion.",5
Great company with friends.  Service was a little slow.   Decent food.  Lobster pot pie had good flavor but crust too hard to cut.  Would try again.,4
"We had the full three course dinner with wine pairing, yes it’s a bit expensive but OMG THE FOOD! So delicious! We had a couple of incindents but the manager and our server who I think was named Tommy handled it so smoothly so we had a great time with delicious food! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Recommend!!",5
Service was great...Adam our server was phenomenal...food was excellent..maybe the portions a bit to large....yeah right...overall good experience.,5
"Service excellent. My sister 50th birthday gave her free champagne.
Highly recommend the sticky toffee pudding. 10+",5
"I feel like if Gordon came here he would be disappointed… pretty sad because I know he wouldn’t want his name on this restaurant. Gross sticky tables, the lamp on my table probably hasn’t been cleaned in a year. The food was very underwhelming. Bland stake and the onion soup is sub par. Not worth the money or time. Sorry Gordon, I’m a huge fan. Maybe it’s time for a spot check.",2
Pricey but definitely worth the visit. The burgers are amazing,5
Loved the short rib plate!  I als loved the mayo side dip with the fries that came along side the burge... It tasted amazing... Not sure if it's the beef fat ratio or the fat the patty was cooked with but the burger was a little bit on the heavy side.. I felt so full before finishing it... Loved and enjoyed the vibe else!,5
I came yesterday and the food was ok but not the greatest. But I love giving a second chance. I ordered the same thing as yesterday “ The chicken Ceasar Salad” Today made up for yesterday and Rob rocks. Definitely be back,5
The Ale Soup & Beef Wellington was fabulous! The artichoke spinach was really good but the chips suffered from to much grease in the fryer. The asparagus was woody and the carrots were raw on the beef Wellington dinner. The chicken pollard was tasteless and suffered from the same greasy crust. A little more than disappointed with all the choices we had to choose from here and the fast that Ramsay is so hard on others.,3
Let me start of by saying I thought about what I was going to say here. We have been long time fans of Gordon Ramsay and the first place we wanted to eat was at one of his restaurants. We order the beef Wellington and the chip nachos. When the nachos came we started eating and noticed a hair in them. We told the waitress that we just wanted another one. Didn’t want a refund just a replacement. She took out plate and came back within a few minutes with the same plate of nachos reheated in the microwave. We pointed out to her that they were the same ones and she told us they weren’t. Now I was frustrated because they had a missing spot of chips where we were eating before. Now they were soggy and the cheese was microwave burned. Not happy at all.,2
Was able to get in without reservation 1HR wait.  Food good as expected but must try the dessert.  Sticky Toffee Pudding has vanilla ice cream and carmel sauce.   Great!,5
"Awesome Awesome Awesome!!!! David was the best bartender ever and I've met alot!!!! The staff, the GM super friendly!! I highly recommend going if you can't get into Hells Kitchen.  The food, the experience was worth every penny!!!! Go!!!!",5
I had a wonderful experience eating here. The burger and fries were delicious- complimented by our waiter being prepared and helpful. The ambiance and intrigue were consistent with the homemade ketchup and music. The Gordon Ramsey cab was particularly delicious with a group of flavors that lasted on the tongue. Perfectly oaked. It held up to the taste of the burger and paralleled the tiny charcoal taste that the grill made. One small thing I kept thinking as I sipped the wine was that it was a little bit more chilled than I would have preferred. A room temperature cab paired with the burger would have capped the experience. Bravo,5
"Good food, great service",4
My pub bacon burger was amazing! We did have an issue with our wings but the waiter handled it without us even having to ask! The pudding was absolutely decadent!,4
Nice place and polite staff but below average burger. It was not not juicy at all. My expectations from Gordon Ramsey were much higher.,3
I ordered the filet mignon to be cooked medium. I received an over cooked steak that was burnt black. The waitress took it away and had it replaced. She returned with a new steak and I slices it in front of her. This steak was rare really dark red. She took it back and had it cooked longer. The waitress returned and it wasn't exactly medium as requested but I accepted it. Who ever authorized my steak to be served to me should be fired along with the chef. The manager and waitress apologized at least 7 times that started to get annoying. I wish Gordon was there to see it. See the picture I included.,2
"Phenomenal food, service and atmosphere. Ordered the chicken paillard. Amazing. Oh and the Carmel toffee bread pudding with vanilla ice cream but fabulous.",5
"The staff was unattentive to our special needs they did not bother to call the manager to see if we could be assisted I ended up having a little salad and having to go somewhere else to complete my dinner do not recommend,  they are highly rated and overpriced will never go there again!!",1
"Do not order the New York Strip.  It was tough to cut and had many tendons.  The side garnish was simply four slightly cooked cherry tomatoes still on the vine.

What are you thinking Chef Ramsay?

The Beef Wellingon was excellent and is highly recommended.  The dessert; Toffee Pudding was the finest and deserves five-stars.

Actually, I should have ordered two Toffee Puddings and coffee and skipped the rest for a perfect meal.

Chef Ramsay; please review the provisioning and preparation of the New York Strip at Caesars Las Vegas.  Server was great; however he attempted to blame a dull knife for a horrible $60 New York Strip.  LOL",2
"We actually went here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  Both times the food was exactly what you would expect...outstanding!  For lunch my husband got the the burger and fries and I got the BLT and chips.  My husband said it was the best burger.  Then at supper, my husband got the Tenderloin steak and the lobster mac-n-cheese and said they were some of the best food he ever ate.  The mac-n-cheese was loaded with lobster.  I got the 3 course tasting menu of diver scallops,  Beef Wellington, and sticky toffee pudding.  The scallops were amazing and the sticky toffee pudding was the best dessert I've ever eaten.   Just Wow!!",5
"Awesome food
. One of the best... HOWEVER... ABSOLUTELY AND HORRIBLE SERVICE..
NOT WORTH THE PRICE, FOR THIS SIMPLE REASON.  THAT'S WHY ONLY 3 STARS..",3
"**Posting from January 2021**
The appetizer was delicious! The main courses lacked flavor, I was disappointed in the steak and beef wellington.",3
"Absolutely amazing! Couldn't get into HK or Burger until Monday, so went the casino route and wasn't disappointed. The decor makes you forget you're even on the floor of a casino, and the staff is quite attentive.",5
"The fare here is understandably quite expensive, but it is an overall good value, depending on what you get.

My wife got the three course meal, which featured the beef wellington, and the meal itself was quite delicious. The first course was a caesar's salad, which was about as ordinary as it gets. The wellington was of course cooked to Gordon's specifications, though the potatoes were about as bland as the powdered variety. Finally, the sticky toffee cake was perfect!

I, on the other hand ordered the burger. It was not the best burger I've ever had, but it hit the spot. It was cooked to my request, and it was big and juicy, but the bread was unfortunately quite stale. If I may offer a suggestion, do not ""upgrade"" your fries to the truffle fries, as they were far too over seasoned, and tasted purely of garlic oil and salt.

Overall nice atmosphere and service, but I'm afraid the food does not live up to my expectations. Perhaps it is due to the sheer volume of people sitting, or perhaps due to its status as a tourist attraction. Either way, if you ever wanted to try Gordon's famous beef wellington, then have at it, just don't expect much from the rest of your meal.",3
"Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill was our most surprising meal during our most recent trip to Vegas!! We came for a Saturday afternoon lunch and were seated quickly. The tiki punch was my favorite cocktail we had throughout our entire trip it was flavorful and had a depth of flavor I wasn’t expecting. The fish and chips, which is the best selling dish, was honestly perfect with a fantastic crispy coating and extremely wonderfully flaky fish and the steak fries were perfect. The pesto chicken sandwich was also delicious!! Highly recommend!!",5
"Excellent food, fantastic service. Our waiter was super helpful, friendly and had a great sense of humor.",5
"As usual, at a Gordon Ramsey place, you will find the servers are excellent. The food is very good, but what really tops the 5 stars for me are the nachos. Cannot recommend them enough.",5
3 course meal was incredible!,5
"Overall, wasn’t wowed by this restaurant like I expected to be. Would’ve enjoyed it more if it weren’t in the smoke filled casino. But the food was great and the toffee pudding a la mode was EXCEPTIONAL!!",4
Worst restaurant in life! Bad service /food,1
Had to try the beef wellington and the meat was melt in your mouth.  And the toffee pudding was one of the best desserts I've ever had.,4
Delicious! Definitely worth a visit!,5
Loud atmosphere on game days but fun and the servers were very friendly. Food came out fast and was great.,4
What a place to dine. Had the best steak I've ever had and will more than likely ruin every other steak for me. Great service and very friendly staff.,5
"The only way this experience could've been better is if Gordon Ramsay himself made a surprise visit, sat across the table from me, and graced us with his presence. Just, WOW. 11/10, I highly recommend the Beef Wellington - this was a treat and possibly the best meal I've ever had. Go try it out, you won't be disappointed!",5
"OMG! I am a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsey! I have a mild crush on him. Very mild. The food is good. Expensive for Vegas, not surprised. It was nice to get a chance to see it in person versus the TV. It would've been nice if the beef wellingtons sold separately, and risotto was not on the menu. Those two things I wanted to try. When I get a chance on my next visit, then I will go to the other Ramsey's restaurant. Maybe that one have what I want.",4
The best in Pub. Everything was awesome. The Shepherds Pie was phenomenal and the Sticky Toffee Pudding is the best Sticky Toffee Pudding on the planet. The service was also exceptional. Very professional and knew when to check-up and when to meet our needs. They make you feel like their top clientele. Thank you for amazing food and service.,5
"I planned a week ahead to take my husband here while in town.  Had a reservation at 5:30 pm on a Thursday night, walk to the restaurant & there is a line of couples waiting to get in. My husband stands in line while I look for the sign that ways ""reservations"", there was none.  That right there was disappointing.  Then we get seated at the rail, where everyone is stopping by to see the menu & prices.  Now during a pandemic I did not want to sit so close to the general public walking by, so we changed tables.  I ordered the Caesars salad, which was wonderful.  My husband ordered the filet mignon & the mashed potatoes.  He barely ate his, the filet outside was like beef jerky & potatoes were so-so. I paid $122.43 + $25 tip & we wont be going back anytime again.",2
"What can i say but excellent food and staff. Chris was our waiter and he was polite and courteous and answered all my questions i had. we had the fish and chips, beef wellington and then sticky putting for desert. every bite was wonderful and glorious. we will be back next time we go to vegas... what a great lunch and meal to end our stay in Las Vegas.",5
"If you can’t book a reservation at Hell’s Kitchen, then this place is an alternative for Beef Wellington.",4
Food could use tad more seasoning. Love the ambiance and layout of the restaurant. Being right in Caesar Palace makes it a even more unique experience of Vegas.,4
"Absolutely amazing! We went for happy hour before seeing “O” and came back for a late dinner afterwards. My thoughts were how good could this really be...now I understand that yes, it’s worth the price and why Gordon Ramsey is as famous as he is. The quality and attention to detail is superb. First 2 pictures are of an old fashioned, the ice cube had the restaurant logo on it! Hellfire wings, perfect spice and hot that didn’t linger! Wellington was well...look, perfect!!! Absolutely fantastic!!!",5
"The food was so good and the sticky toffee pudding was heaven.  Staff was great and really hustled.  Never had to wait for drink refills, for the bill, to order, nada.  They were on top of everything.",5
Had the 3 course meal with the beef Wellington. Very good! Ali was great and attentive!,5
"Food was excellent and came out fast.
Price was reasonable and I’d definitely go back!",5
I would have liked it better if the waiter was better. The food was great but definitely overpriced if your waiter is not that good.,3
"So, I passed by the place, and thought, I love Gordon Ramsey, I wonder if his standards are like they are on t.v. I walked in, sat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and knowledgable. The shrimp appetizer (amazing) I do not know where they come from but they are the best. Second, the burger oak fired was simply amazing with truffle fries. It was hands down the best burger anywhere that i have had, sorry Houston, but he has you beat. I wish I could have met him, they say he comes in frequently.  Maybe next time.",5
Food was good but pricey $$$$. Good size brewski.,3
Our server was so sweet and made sure our glass was never half full. I liked the spinach artichoke dip.,4
"Food was good and service was great - thank you, Christopher!  Fish and chips and short ribs nachos - yum 😋",4
Amazing!! Best meal of my life.,5
I used to love Ramsays place at Caesars but the prices have gotten too high. Honestly the  fish and chips is better at his fish and chips place by the Linq. Service is great and the place is fun just wish it was cheaper and better.,3
Overpriced but it's Vegas. Food and service were both okay. The spinach artichoke dip was very good. The chicken entree with fennel salad was okay but not great.,4
Magical pub! Our waitress Sarah has the sweetest  kindest energy in the world.,5
"Very disappointed, went for lunch today. Was recommended the fish and chips by the waiter, ordered it and bum! Tasteless dish… literally no flavor. Worst of all… got me sick fee hours later. Overpriced food and not at the standards you would think something with Gordon Ramsey’s name would be.",1
"Sadly disappointed. I have it 3 stars because we were able to get right in with no wait and the lobster rolls were delicious. But the burger was not very good. We ordered it medium rare but it was medium well. Fries were ok, but a little greasy.",3
It was truly amazing and delicious! Anyone who says otherwise is a donut.,5
"Great atmosphere. Outstanding food. Regardless of whether you choose the Beef Wellington or the Bacon Cheeseburger, you will not be disappointed! Worth a visit.",5
For me I not to good !! I eat in another small restaurant In Saint George I Peruvian cuisine the name of that restaurant is Peruvian flavor! That's restaurant the food have more flavor than Pub & grill Gordon Ramsay!👎 For me for i pay is not better than another restaurant you can eat much delicious I another place. Why? Because my wife eat I salad and the vinaigrette smell steal! And the flavor 🤢,1
I have had better fish n chips.  My loves Lobster pot pie was pretty bland.   Disappointed as I was excited to eat here.,3
"Not what I expected from a Gordon Ramsay associated restaurant. Truly disappointed. The fish and chips was lacking any salt or seasoning, absolutely bland, and that’s not due to it being British.  Wife ordered the 8 oz fillet mignon but we were instead served what seemed to be an 8 ounce striploin. I’m not sure if they ran out of the cut or are simply just serving anything to their customers. Not as advertised. Expected much more from Gordon Ramsay. Would not recommend.",2
"The salad was good, I really liked the dessert and our server was awesome. However the Beef Wellington was the worst piece of meat we have ever had. Forced myself to eat just over half of it as the bill was going to be over $200. My wife felt the same. Real bummer as I was so excited to try it after seeing it made on the Hell’s Kitchen show over the years. Actually got sick to my stomach just thinking about it again.",1
"Agree 100% of other posts. If you want to say you went to a GR restaurant then check! I'm a complete fan of Gordon and all shows! After watching the ""Young Guns"" season of Hell's Kitchen & seeing the winner torn apart on his fish & chips, I thought...I must order fish & chips! Clearly attention to detail is lacking here. The plate was not wiped, tartar sauce was in my vinegar, ketchup slung on chips, batter greasy and fish not seasoned at all.  I was a bit shocked that my rating of this meal was less than the Bar-B-Q stuffed potato at the Pawn Stars take a way shack.  Please get a new chef.  Also, would have loved the tasting menu, but you can only order the meat medium-rare...Medium should be acceptable.  I'm saddened greatly!!! But, I still bought me a fridge magnet, just not one that said ""done well"" cuz clearly not allowed here.",2
Good time. Staff was friendly. Would return. A little on the high side for prices,5
Amazing experience.  Food was incredible and the staff attentive. Make a reservation.,5
My beef Wellington was cold but the plate was hot..weird... taste okay..but I would love it if the food on my hot plate were hot as plate.,3
Delicious and good service,5
"Tasty, but a tad expensive. Large draft beer selection, but a disappointing selection of Craft beers.",5
"Amazing time at Gordon’s pub and gril.
From the moment we made it there we were really taking care of super nicely since we were late about 20 min
Getting ready to close and they still took us in with a smile and made me and my kids feel on top of the world , then we meet Scott  our waiter and he just knew how to explain and serve so well
We really enjoyed the soup of onion and prime rib
Couldn’t get to stop eating those fries
My kids are picky kids and they couldn’t stop eating
The fish and chips 🍟 I think speechless is the word.
So thank you all at Gordon’s very much for real good time .",5
Had the lunch menu and ordered a couple burgers and very dissatisfied. Bland dry burger and salad was soggy... definitely not as good as his other restaurants. Very disappointing also the prices were a bit speedy for sub par food. Gordon you need to make an appearance and yell at the chef and get this food as good as your other restaurants. It's about standards and taste and this place is lacking. Just my opinion.,2
Food was good but not great. Went for the Beef Wellington.  Was ok.,4
"Cool to experience some of the dishes Gordon Ramsay is best known for. Overpriced for the atmosphere. Only ended up here because Hell’s Kitchen was booked up. Beef Wellington a touch too dry, scallops I could have enjoyed same quality anywhere in Seattle. Service was a bit off too but super friendly nonetheless.",4
"Reserving in advance and excited to eat in a place associated with an ""award winning chief"", we were given a plate filled with oil! Signature fish and chips was too plaid with tons of oil. Total disappointment!",1
"Friendly, fast, food was good.  Noisy, loud, and peas don’t belong with anything let alone fish and chips.  Might have been able to swap them out but thought it was just a few peas not a bowl of smashed peas..do not care for peas but if you like peas you May enjoy them.  Drinks were tasty but again hotel restaurant with hotel pricing.  Would go back as I did enjoy.",4
"Is there a GR restaurant that's not good? This place is great. The food, the service, the atmosphere.  And the windows are so clean!",5
Delicious food good atmosphere great service but a little pricey I give it four and a half stars,4
"Great service, great food, everything was what I expected and wanted
We celebrated our 20th anniversary here",4
"Food and drinks were great, service was good. The high top tables were neat but I wish the chairs had backings and not just a barstool. Would still go back!",5
"The people were friendly as was the presentation of the food.  However, it was tasteless!  Nothing I had was any good.  I think Gordon need to put some focus on his own restaurant....",1
"Great food and fun atmosphere. We got lucky, with our party of 10, we had a private room in back and 2 excellent waiters. Food was awesome.",5
Amazing.  The food here is outstanding.   Our server Jenny was wonderful . Very friendly and had good conversation with us and was super attentive.   Will go back,5
The brunette hostess (forgot her name) was rude and not a customer friendly person. Beside that the server was polite and the wellington steak is good.,2
"No ice nachos too soggy from cheese sauce I should have ordered it on side taste like potato's au gratin and NOT nachos, weird film reside on table I was able to write my name on...burger was good",3
"The service is perfect in every aspect. But the music and noise levels are over the top, the casino is quieter.  The food is so so.  Definitely not high end but will help your hangover which is why we went.",4
"Gordon Ramsay would be ashamed. The nachos were great but the rest of the food was mediocre at best, especially for the price you pay. Waitress was pretty inattentive as well.",2
I would give this place a 5 star but only because its a Gordon Ramsay place I really was expecting more,4
"Both times I've gone to Vegas I ate here. The food was amazing 2 years ago and it was still amazing this most recent time. The truffle fries are EPIC! The service is also great, it's never too busy in there, and the prices are reasonable for the location.",5
"This place actually lives up to the hype of Ramsay.  We had the Beef Wellington, Short Rib, and Fish & chips.  It was simply fantastic.  Highly recommend if you are in Vegas.",5
"We came in 10/23  to celebrate my son's 15th birthday. He loves Gordon Ramsay and was looking forward to having the beef Wellington. As a party of 8 we were seated at high top table with bar stools  - there was not enough space for drinks and dishes to be arranged in a manner conducive for a comfortable dining experience. I actually stood to eat while holding my dish. One of our entrees was missing and we stopped the closest person to let her know we were still waiting for someone's food. Her curt reply ""let your server know"" was packaged with an eye roll and tone that quickly communicated her disdain. Quite disappointing. That said, the server (Michelle, from Utah) took excellent care of my son and even gifted him a t-shirt. Overall the food was underwhelming - the French onion soup was enjoyable,  while The beef Wellington, mashed potatoes, and asparagus were cold and lacking flavor. The sticky toffee pudding was a fantastic way to end the otherwise mediocre meal.",2
"Service was below expectations, especially considering that the restaurant was not busy. The featured entree, beef Wellington, was not served hot. Nothing on the plate was hot. Onion soup was good. Desert, sticky toffee cake & ice-cream, was tasty. All in all, just average fare.",3
Great staff and good food. Took my parents their for my dad's birthday celebration. The booth were separated with plexiglass. We feel safe with tables setup far apart from separated parties. All of our food selection were really good.,5
The server and the buzzer were absolutely courteous! The food is amazing! You get what you pay for.,5
Our waiter Chris was fabulous. He was very knowledgeable.  He suggested the lobster roll as an appetizer. It was delicious. We ordered the filet mignon I got a side of asparagus & my boyfriend got a side of the mashed potatoes. Everything was cooked perfectly. I can't wait to come back!,5
One of the best experiences in vegas.  All of the food was incredible and the staff was extremely helpful and attentive.  Thank you to chef Mike for the wonderful food.,5
Great food and atmosphere,5
"First time and a Gordon restaurant and not disappointed ! Nice ambiance and food. The pub style is very affordable and you have that british feeling that every one is looking for !

Nice beer list, i ask for suggestions and the serveur suggested me a very nice beer. The decor is adding to the experience! Make your way for lunch and enjoy. You have to try the toffee pudding for dessert.. it taste like a dream",4
"The food was good and so was our waiter. He kept telling how nice Gordon Ramsay actually is, which surprised us a tad bit! We got the Deviled eggs, crispy Calamari and Hellfire Wings. All of them tasted good and the wings were sure as hell hot!
For the mains, we had the dishes under Classic Ramsay: Butter Chicken curry and Shepherd's Pie. The chicken was really soft and well cooked, but the dish was not spicy. I expected the rice to taste somewhat better and the dish to have an Indian flavor. Guess the Butter chicken did have a Ramsay twist to it! The naan was soft and good. The person who had the Shepherd's pie liked it. It was good, overpriced food just because it was Gordon Ramsay!",5
Good food,5
"We went on Christmas day, got a reservation and got seated after a short wait.

The food was great, the staff was wonderful and the decor was interesting. We also got a lot of food for the price! The complimentary fries were also really good,so thank you!

I'm giving it 5 stars but if the choice was between this and the Burger one over at Planet Hollywood and I just wanted to eat at any Ramsay restaurant I would go there. It's nothing personal against the Pub and Grill, it really just depends on what kind of atmosphere you prefer.

On our next visit we plan to try the steakhouse, or maybe even Hell's Kitchen, looking forward to it!",5
"Quick seating no wait.  Attentive server, pleasant, but talked way to fast hard to understand him!.  Food came out hot and in a timely manner.  We got the cheddar burger medium rare cooked perfectly, fries and a great garlic aioli on the side for dipping, that was wonderful.  Calamari was good, a little rubbery, so over cooked just a bit.  Good experience overall.",4
"This place is amazing! Not only having good service and the food came out super quick, it was efficient and the food tasted wonderful. Will be back. Want to thank Chef Michael and our server Carlos for a wonderful experience.",5
"I don't traditionally eat fish, unless it's raw, but I decided this is a pub run by a Brit and he ought to know how to do fish and chips right... So I went for it.  Crispy batter, tasty tender juicy flaky fish.  Wow!  I'm glad I did it.  Truly happy with the experience.  Great service, great food.",5
Just wanted a quick bite. Went with the nachos. It was excellent.,5
Good food and great beer.,4
I had steak dinner here and I will definitely be back,5
Very cool experience. I ordered the nachos. A lot of meat to many small chips but overall great. Food came out faster than I’ve ever experienced.,4
"I had the fish and chips with a side of mashed peas.  My wife had the french onion soup and we shared an appetizer, artichoke dip with freshly made crisps, (potato chips). Definitely a five-star experience you must go!",5
Definitely an amazing place to visit and eat at. The food was amazing! Even though it did have the smaller menu. Definitely order the short rib kettle chip nachos. You won't be disappointed,5
"The service here was more than exceptional. Staff was super kind and helpful. The only problem I had was the food. I had ordered the Beef Wellington in the 3 course. So I had very high expectations. The mushrooms were salty for some reason. The food was not horrible, but more of average and overpriced but I ate it all anyways. I think the only thing I would order again would be the sticky toffee pudding. That was out of this world. My family didn’t seem to like their food too much. They said the buns on the food seemed as if they were stale and had been sitting out too long. Maybe I just didn’t like the taste because I’ve never had anything like it before. So if you go, definitely give it a try. But would me and my family go again? Probably not.",4
"Reservation: easy
Decor: Awesome
Staff: Knowledgeable and friendly
Service: Fast and friendly
Cleanliness: spotless
Food service: perfectly coursed
Food: AMAZING. PERFECT.
Drinks: beautiful presentation, tasted amazing.
Price: About right
Recommend? ABSOLUTELY",5
Huge fans of Gordon Ramsay! We went out for my husband's birthday and the staff all treated us like royalty. We had requested for drinks to be at the table when we arrived and everything was on point. The food was stellar too. Definitely recommend the nachos! My husband also ordered the old fashioned and that bad boy will make ya grow a pair! Oooohwee! Super smooth and delicious but very strong. Overall I would definitely come back another time!,5
"Great service. We wanted to try Gordon Ramsey's specialty - beef Wellington. It was very good. There is a prix fixe lunch menu with this as the main course, and it's a good deal. You are definitely paying for the name at this restaurant, but the food is very good as well. We also had the fish and chips - perfectly cooked fish just what we got in the UK, the bone marrow appetizer - even I had a second bite and I'm usually not a fan of marrow, and the sticky toffee pudding - exceptional. Would definitely return.",5
"Service … great
Fish and chips… great
Chicken sandwich… I’ve had better at popeyes for sure. This overcooked dried out biscuit was sub par. I expected more from a Ramsey restaurant!!! I asked for a replacement which the team promptly replaced with  the same result.",2
Food was ok service was horrible,3
"Not bad. Not good. Just acceptable. You're paying almost entirely for the Gordon Ramsay brand without, apparently, its associated taste and standards that one expects.",3
Great food. The Best staff friendly informative and knowledgeable. Great experience every time we go.,5
"Disappointed by the pub burger. Attention to detail was not present. Wait staff was exceptional good but food was not up to  par or what you'd expect from Gordon Ramsey""s kitchen.",3
"So disappointing. You watch tv and see the great dishes he creates and service Gordon likes to provide then come here and receive a burnt tasteless steak and service on par with McDonald’s. I came here expecting good service and delicious food considering its a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and got the complete opposite. Two stars instead of one since the nacho appetizer we ordered did taste very good. On the other hand my steak not so much. The steak had virtually no taste and was seared way too much. It was like it had a burnt crust shell on the entire steak. For some reason the bar also put ice in my cider. I have never once had any bar anywhere put ice in a cider. Aside from the food our server was terrible. He had a poor attitude from the beginning and seemed irritated if we had any questions or needed anything else other than your dining basics.
All in all, for $100 meal choose anywhere else out of the thousands of places to eat on the strip. This place was such a disappointment. Never again.",2
Great casual plate with 5 star dining. Love anything Chef Ramsey is part of. Beer selection incredible. Food incredible. Highly recommend this pub.,5
"The food was absolutely delicious.  Gordon Ramsay being on of my favorite chefs in the world, I knew the food was gonna be delicious.  I can't wait to go back there again",5
"We were seated right away and food came out at a good speed as well. The food was the high point eating here, some amazingly cooked steak, butter chicken, pot pie, mac and cheese, and the toffee cake dessert were cooked fantastically and would not disappoint. The only thing that prevented the 5th star in my mind was the slightly disinterested, though polite, waiter who served us. Despite his lack of personal investment in our visit this was a great place to eat for the great food and fun atmosphere.",4
"Great food, great service!",5
Awesome lunch! Beef wellington was delicious!,5
"Got the three course meal and lobster pot pie. Waiter never came to check in and Wellington was cold. I’d give one star but the other food was okay. I usually give five stars but here needed to deduct for service, atmosphere, and cold food.",2
Great Beef Nachos... Ever,5
Great restaurant at Ceasars Palace for a quick meal.,5
"The two young ladies at the front were the highlight of my first visit to Gordon Ramsay Pup & Grill. We ordered lobster rolls for an appetizer. We couldn’t taste any lobster, it was all mayonnaise. Our main course was fish and chips. The fish was very greasy with a lot of batter. The fries were also very greasy and had an enormous amount of salt on them. I only had a couple of bites of everything. It was extremely disappointing. The server never refilled our water.",1
Great service and amazing food,5
Went here on a food tour! The nachos are delicious! The apple cider was great too! ❤️,5
"The stools as chairs are awful. In any normal restaurant, it would ensure no more than two stars, regardless of service. However, the food was incredible. So, six stars for the food, negative two for horrible chairs, discomfort, and the ambiance of a running jet engine. Recommended, I’ll be back.",4
One of the waitress were very nice and had great customer service she took very good care of my husband and I. Kudos to her I dont remember her name but when I go there again I will definite know who she is because I never forget a face.,5
"Bummed out.  Wanted to eat here and made a reservation! It was going to be my first time at a Ramsay establishment and I’d had a reservation for 2 months.  Wife wanted to eat earlier so we went to try to get in earlier and move our reservation, the teenager up front said “everything’s running on time tonight”.  After a couple of gentle inquiries with this scripted line being the rote response, we went to Vanderpumps.  They were super accommodating and wonderful all around!  Bummer, I likely won’t bother with the “f’ing poppets” here, again.  Ruined it; I’m sure Gordon didn’t teach them that level of service.",1
"Love this guy and actually having his food was amazing! Ordered prime rib, beef welly (was not raw in the middle.) & Scallops that were not cooked like rubber!",5
"Overall, we had an okay experience here. The service was fine, but not very attentive and slightly slow. We shared the three-course dinner, which included the worst Caesar salad I think I've ever had, Ramsay's famous Beef Wellington (which was fabulous and made the visit worthwhile!), and a very good sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The Beef Wellington came with literally one carrot stick cut in half lengthwise, one asparagus spear cut in half lengthwise, and a small dollop of potatoes. They were more of a garnish than a side. We also got the spinach artichoke dip appetizer, which was fine but a little greasy and stringy. We had water to drink and our final bill with tax and tip was $120. The ambiance was like a somewhat upscale sports bar with TVs everywhere and was incredibly loud. We agreed that it was overpriced for the setting and service, and ultimately was just riding on Gordon Ramsay's name.",3
Awesome!! Wish I could have met Chef Gordon,5
The pork nachos were amazing! Gave us dessert for free for our anniversary.,5
"Great food, excellent service & ok prices!
We were looking for a restaurant in Caesars Palace and this looked interesting..  we were not disappointed!
We took the Rib nachos as starter. Beef burger, fish & chips and Caesar’s salad. The taste & the quality of meat is very good. Photos with all the dishes below.
Overall including drinks and tip it will go around 30-50$/person (unless you go for the menu which is 80$ or some signature dishes that go above 50$). I also attached the full menu from today, 30 October 2019.
The servers are super nice & helpful - they deserve a good tip!
Gordon has some nice places in Las Vegas!
Overall a nice place if you’re in the area. A+!",5
"As if I would dare criticize one of Gordon's restaurants! Seriously though, I had the best nachos I ever tasted here. They also caused this to be the first time ever I was unable to finish a steak. Thinking back on it now I wish I still could, it was absolutely amazing. Good times.",5
"Food was excellent quality, but the pricing was outrageous.  I suppose it's expected for the Last Vegas Strip, but I'm still knocking it a star for that alone.  The desserts were incredible - definitely recommend trying both options.",4
"Has very good food consistent with what you expect for an establishment with Gordon's name on it, however menu did seem very limited and be ready to drop some money for the brand. Had nice decor and a cool atmosphere to it. Inside casino so be ready for a hard search to find",4
"Not even in England  , have i eaten the fish ans chips you find here .  Yes , a great restaurant 👌",5
"This is a great experience. All of the food was top notch. This was a special of the day, so the price was very reasonable. Nicole was our server, and she was amazing!!

The portion sizes were perfect, very satisfied.

This is a sports bar setting, so the TV placement was great, any direction you look, you can see the game.

Bring a significant other here some time!",5
"Came during restaurant week. Was fantastic. The waitress was very helpful, funny, and made the experience enjoyable. We ordered the set menu, wings (5-6), slow roasted pork belly, beef Wellington, cheesecake, toffee pudding. Everything was fantastic. Beef Wellington melted in my mouth. I'd recommend the pudding over the cheesecake, unless you like fruity cheesecake.",5
It was great but I had better expectations.,5
We got salads. They were decent. Large beer selection. There were lots of gnats flying around.,3
I love this place the burger to die for and the mash potatoes are amazing!,5
"Went there thinking that the food will not be as good as the restaurant located on the Strip, But I was surprised with the quality and the taste of the food. My only complain was the attitude of the manager of the night shift (friday) who was extremelly rude with us ehen I asked for a different table. he yelled us and did not understand our frustration for being sitted next to the cutlery shelf when they were many empty tables. thank god the waiter fix the issues without telling him.",4
"Looking for a place to have a quick meal before meeting with friends and was able to get a bar seat immediately here. Full food service at the bar and the service was great. So were the UK Old Fashioned, Hummus, and Butter Chicken Curry. One important note on the curry: it has more heat than most butter chicken I have had. I really liked it, but if you are expecting creamy and low spice you are in for a surprise. The bartender was exceptionally attentive and we had a great time discussing NHL expansion in Vegas and Seattle. This is a very good place to grab a quick bite at the bar and the other menu items make me sure it is good for a longer dinner with friends.",5
Great food.  Great service. Fun environment.,5
"got right in.
service great .
food was good & lot of it.",4
Our waitress was so lovely and catered our meal for us. The food was delicious. I felt like I had died and gone to heaven. The desert was so flavorful it gave me goosebumps as eat flavour touched my taste buds. A must do! Book in advance so you don't miss out or have to wait in a line.,5
"My daughter and I enjoyed ourselves. The Beef Wellington was superb. The only problem ,“at the pub” was that there was anything to take my soup home in.  We left the soup. I was disappointed. I thought that a fine restaurant would have dishes to take your food away in. I suppose you can’t order soup to go? ☹️☹️☹️",4
"My wife and I  really enjoyed the food. The wings were great with the perfect amount of spice. We also got a steak which was AMAZING! the orange juice was freshly squeezed and was cold. The ceasar salad was not bad either.
The waiter was very nice and took our order and smiled and was friendly and she recommended the steak for me. We also had hummus and fries.
The vibe is nice but it's really loud which is not a surprise since the place is Inside a casino.
The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the host was not really friendly , maybe she was tired or bad mood, otherwise everything was great.",4
Had the beef Wellington and it exceeded my already high expectations. The bartender was slinging some seriously good cocktails as well.,5
"Great food, some of us had the burger and some had the grilled cheese with rib meat. All of it was amazing! Also the nachos appetizer was quite good. And service was wonderful, it's pricey but you get what you pay for.",5
"Too expensive for the portions! Food was so so.

Would not go back!
Waitress was excellent 💙💜",1
Excellent food and atmosphere! Server was very friendly and helpful.  All of my party was pleased with the food. My 6 oz filet was divine!,5
"To be honest, we had no intention of eating here, we just coukdnt go to our first option. But after eating here, IT WOULD BE OUR FIRST OPTION. Our server, Christopher, was the best! The portions so filling we were stuffed, and the taste was out of this world!",5
Absolutely delicious!,5
Very cool place! Good atmosphere/vibe and the food was great as well. Good drink selection and nothing beats getting beer in a mug the size of your head!,5
We recently visited Las Vegas and had lunch there. The food was lovely and Sarah our waitress was amazing! Sarah really added a lot to the experience!,5
"Best meal I've ever had. Beef Wellington is such a comforting dish, and Gordon Ramsay's is the best.",5
"The food & restaurant lived up to its name & reputation. Steaks were cooked to perfection & flavorful. I tried Bone-In Ribeye (section: oak fire grill) & Prime Rib or Beef (section: signature Ramsey). You MUST try “sticky toffee pudding”, I plan on going again just for this desert. Special appreciation for our server & the service we got. Ambience is cool & don’t forget to take picture with the Gordon Ramsey poster!",5
"Perfection for party of four. Every dish was special. Beef Wellington, Filet, Strip, Prime Rib, all were perfect. Great staff and room. They accept Caesars rewards! Returning soon...",5
"Since we couldn't get into Hell's Kitchen, we decided to try at least one of Gordon's restaurants while in Vegas.  We had already eaten breakfast and were still somewhat full when we walked by here, but we decided to have drinks and an appetizer since there was no line at the time.  We ordered the Truffle Spinach and Artichoke Dip with Pita chips and Havarti Cheese and it was delicious.  Our mistake was not ordering two since it was so good.  We also ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was also delicious.  Overall, we walked by here around 11 when they opened and had we known, we would have saved our appetites' from breakfast so that we could enjoy more of the offerings.",5
"Nice place, but I would say portions are a bit small, and we were very disappointed to know beef wellington has pork in it (allergic to pork). The lobster potpie was delicious but small portion and would have loved the side to be smtg else than just arugula. The waiter on the other hand, Sladja,  was amazing. Super service,  very helpful, very friendly, very knowledgeable!!!",4
Best beef wellington EVAR! and they have Kilkenny beer.,5
Great pub food and that beef wellington is worth multiple visits.,5
The steak and the fish and chips were great. Worth upgrading to truffle fries. Our waitress Sara was the best part of the experience. Love this place. Celebrate your birthday at Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill with Sara Stacy!,5
"Very good food, good drinks, and a ""good enough"" atmosphere (because it's tucked on the side of the casino floor). If it weren't covered in TVs, it would be a bit better. Having a bunch of bros yelling at the game around you isn't the best fine dining experience...",4
"Amazing food and Amazing service. I enjoyed a scotch egg and ""Gordon's Favorite Lunch"" which consisted of his famous beef Wellington, mashed potatoes, and vegetables along with stickey toffee pudding topped with ice cream.

The scotch egg was one of the best I ever had.  The Wellington was cooked perfectly, wish amazing potatoes. I didn't finish my veggies, only because I wanted to save room for the desert, which I was not able to finish. I was stuffed until the next morning.

It was the best meal I had in Las Vegas. I would recommend for anyone, it is well worth the cost.",5
Lobster roll was excellent as was the beer and cheese soup and the wedge salad. Pricey but what in Vegas isn't.,4
Nice place to dine with my friends. Ne reservation needed at around 5-6 pm. Very welcoming staff and the menu is not too expensive. My lamb burger 🍔 and my girlfriend’s fish and chips were delicious 👍🇺🇸,5
Great food! Best meat ever! Good staff!,5
"To start off, when we entered the place smelled like a fish market by the docks. The food was sub par at best and had no flavor. If I was Gordon Ramsay, I would personally do an intervention at this place. For it to be attached to Gordon Ramsay's name is a real shame. I really admire the guy.",1
"I almost always  stop in here when I am in town for one of their signature  cocktails. On this trip, my favorite  was not available  because  one of the ingredients  was unavailable.  So, while I was disappointed,  I had one drink for old times sake. Great bartenders.  Extremely  knowledgeable.",4
"The New York steak was cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes were cheesy and very tasty! This is Ramsey and this is Vegas, expect to pay for the wonderful experience. It's worth it! Enjoy!",5
"Went there with high expectations, aggggg. I can only comment on the fish and chips and wow what a let down. The beer batter was tasteless, as was the fish. The fries were mushy and un appealing. $50 got me the fish and chips and a glass of house white. The bartender/server could have not been more attentive, bravo for that.",3
"The food was good, the three course meal was tasty., The Beef Wellington I had was tasty but some parts were salty. The service was okay, a bit slow but this place is worth checking out. I wish the service was a little better and the Beef Wellington I had was not as salty.",4
Just had an appetizer and some drinks. Lobster and Shrimp roll was great and perfect for a quick bite. Great drinks.,5
Food and service were very good. The truffle fries are fantastic!,5
Had a burger and cocktails. Loved it! Very delicious. I was craving a burger and it totally hit the spot. The service was outstanding and the decor is cool.,5
"I’ve been here wen it opened originally so many moons ago ... it has improved 10 fold. Glad to have come back! Had the short ribs amazing, steak tartar, scotch egg was unreal, and of course the signature sticky toffee pudding. I wish Ramsay would just make the ice cream standard across all three restaurants as I’ve eaten at all three.... it should just be the brown butter ice cream served at the steakhouse. It’s far superior to anything and really makes the sticky toffee superior at the steakhouse! But other than that overall experience was very very good. Service was excellent, attentive and you could tell they understood the menu. Which you would expect from a Ramsay restaurant!! 5 stars!!!",5
"Had fish n chips. Fish was good, cooked on point but 2 stars come from tartar sauce which was possibly poured many hours ago. Gordon himself goes to absolute staged kitchens and blasts off and at this point can not go above 2 stars since he got same kind of thing happening at his own place. I can not call it ridiculous but you don't have right to serve this while you blast off other people's kitchen.",2
My parents took my fiancee and I to Vegas as a wedding present and we decided to stop here as we love all things Gordon Ramsey and I've always wanted to try his beef wellington. We came here the first night and everything was so delicious it ruined all other food to us. We kept comparing all other foods to his and  yours won everytime! Such a good experience we went the last day we were there as well. Definitely a must stop at place!!,5
"Amazing amazing amazing ! Started with crispy pork belly , like an orgasm. Had the beef wellington and the short rib. So good, the vegetables cooked to perfection. Enjoyed the sticky pudding as a dessert with a coffee. Would recommend for a quite bite or doing the tasting menu.",5
This was our first time eating there. The food was delicious and the service was great.,5
Brought the entire family! Our server while his name escapes me was fantastic and made the experience unforgettable. Loved the Pub atmosphere. Most of my family ordered the beef Wellington it was great. Our daughter ordered the filet mignon which she ordered medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. Ordered a “soup of the day”(shot of Jameson and a Guinness). The shot was neat and the Guinness had minimal head. Of course the family and I  are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay and we were not disappointed.  Want to thank the entire staff for helping to make our Vegas trip fantastic. The food was a tad bit expensive but you know what they say when in Rome 😉,5
"Food was good. Not the best and not what you’d expect from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. It was worth the experience, but there’s better food at lower price points in Vegas.",3
"Although the food was good, it was nothing special, steak was burnt and over priced. The glass of wine was also more like a third of a glass. I would recommend any other buffet instead. We are big Gordon Ramsey fans and made the reservation a week in advance, we were so excited to try his restaurant, really just disappointed. If you want to try a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, I would recommend Hell’s Kitchen instead.",2
Loved!!! Wish I could remember our servers name because he was amazing. Did such a great job. Best service we have ever had. He made sure our meal was perfect. He knew right way if something wasn't right and he corrected it immediately. Food was amazing. So good. Can't say enough good things about it. Will be back!,5
"Great dinner. Our server Rodney was awesome. If you missed out on Hell’s Kitchen, come here and you get to do the 3 course meal. The beef Wellington is incredible. I recommend the nachos as a starter. So delicious.",5
So very disappointed. Nachos with packet potato and deconstructed salad consisting of mostly quartered lettuce... Gordon Ramsay whiskey tango foxtrot??? (Photos included in feed) mains were moderately better but that is coming off a low base,1
Food good but pricey for what you get of course it's inside a casino.,4
"It was super busy so we ate at the bar. We were greeted and assisted by the bartender almost immediately..he gave us recommendations and was friendly and accommodating.  He even made us specialty drinks that were amazing. We ordered apps that he suggested and they were so good and paired with our drinks!! The cake was like amazing, sweet and rich and buttery..the wings were hot and crispy and with good spice! The nachos were fantastic! Hands down..short-ribs and kettle chips with the cheese was addictive..I couldnt stop eating them! Lol",5
Me and wifey had a great time lunching at Pub & Grill while walking by the strip. Good local craft beer selection as well.,5
Got to see what all the hype is about with the infamous beef wellington at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant!!,5
The fish and chips are so greasy and not a quality piece of fish. It’s a shame because it’s definitely on the pricey side. We came for lunch. Maybe the dinner is better. I went back for dinner on another night and they were closed. They close at 10pm on week nights as of 9-15-2021.,1
"I was surprised at how much I liked it.  I thought it would be touristy with bad service.  Maybe a bit touristy (hey, it is Las Vegas), but had a very good wait person and the food was amazing.  Excellent Beef Wellington, perfectly rare to medium rare. Great onion soup too.  The Sticky Toffee pudding was good, but does not get a rave.",5
"Food was fantastic, service not so much.",5
Atmosphere was great! Food was 8/10! price is fair for the quality. Customer Service 💯,4
"Beef Wellington and Fish and Chips were pretty good. Nothing life changing, but just as good as any other decent restaurant. Appetizers were okay, drinks awesome. All in all good, not $200 good, but good.",3
Great food and our waiter was great.  We split the Prime rib it had a good taste and we had the white cheddar mashed potatoes.  Everything was great little pricey but its Gordon Ramsey's you got to respect that and it's Vegas Baby.,5
I'm such a huge Hell's Kitchen TV show fan and was excited to see that the Gordon Ramsay's signature items (Beef Wellington & Scallops) were offered at the Pub & Grill. Came in without reservation in the afternoon and was seated immediately. Not a fan of the beef wellington but the scallops were cooked beautifully.,4
"My husband had the beef Wellington. Pastry was flat and soggy. I had the fish and chips. The fish was fabulous but the chips weren’t really chips and tastes as if from a frozen bag. The mushy peas came in the same size container as the tarter sauce. There was about a tablespoon size of peas in it. Finally, the sticky toffee pudding was bland. Didn’t really seem like a Gordon Ramsey type meal. Would not recommend.",1
Love love love it!! Some od THE best English food I've ever tasted! Pigs in blankets made with REAL sausages!! Truffle tries with the best truffle aioli! And the deserts! The pub bar was perfection in and of itself!!,5
The prime rib was super juicy and dessert was good too!!,5
My wife and I got their 3 course meal and I have to say it did not disappoint. Pricy but worth every dollar.,5
"Overall, I can only say amazing. The Beef Wellington and Sticky Toffee Pudding were superb! Great atmosphere and steller service. I am guaranteed to revisit.",5
"Highly recommend trying the set dinner which consists of two delicious scallops, perfectly cooked beef wellington, and finished with a perfect dessert consisting of a chocolate style volcano cake drizzled with sweet sweet caramel. Mark

Service was excellent as expected from this type of establishment. Great selection of drinks and other appetizers and entrees. Definitely worth stopping in to try what is always raved about on Che Ramsay's tv shows.",5
"Third time here and as always great food. This time I had the tasting menu: pan seared scallops, Ramsey’s beef Wellington and the sticky toffee. The food was  amazing, the service not too much but I understood since due to conventions everything was overcrowded.",5
Definitely a Vegas go to! Been here several times always delicious and great service and atmosphere!,4
Amazing food. Our waiter was so nice.,5
"The food was great. Great atmosphere, staff was very attentive without hovering, and the price was reasonable for Caesars Palace.",5
I really enjoyed my meal at the Pub & Grill.  I also had great service while there.  I ordered the 3 course dinner and loved every bite.  The sticky toffee pudding is to die for!  I would highly recommend the meal - but make reservations a head of time and many people were trying to walk up and were being either turned away or given long wait times.,5
"I order fish and ships, fish was great, but Ships were soggy, that’s why I give it a 4, Enviroment is great.",4
We thought food was too expensive. The fish and chips we're nothing to write home about the potatoes were soggy. We never go back again,1
"The wellington was amazing, but the fish n chips and prime rib was so regular for the price.
The waiter service was so good but the food slow",4
The atmosphere and service were great. Our server made great recommendations and we thoroughly enjoyed everything we got. My only complaint was that I couldn't eat any more.,5
Good food.  Great service.,5
Great service and the food was delicious,5
"The restaurant is amazing. Very friendly staff and wait staff. Then when the food arrives, absolutely the best meal I think I've ever eaten. The Lobster mac was fantastic.  The Beef wellington was like heaven on a plate. I also had the toffee dessert and that was moist and delicious.  I've been waiting for a couple years to get out here to eat and it was worth it. Just the best experience I could have asked for.",5
The food has beautiful presentation and the service is amazing.  Flavors were good but I was disappointed in the lobster mac N cheese.  The flavor was nice but there was such a small amount of lobster for the price it didnt seem fair. Overall good experience.,4
"They really bent over backwards to accommodate us when our party grew from 13 to 16. Food was fantastic, service was attentive and professional. An excellent experience...",5
"Good for friends with lively ambience. Food is great. Grilled scallop, truffle fries & Lobster Roll are good to try if you don’t have any idea.  You can sit back , relax with quality of food.",5
Great appetizers selection- try the nachos. My personal favorite. But loved it it was nice and not too long a wait at all.,4
Bartender was rude. We were early for our reservation and were told we could get a drink at the bar while we waited. The bartender was not happy we were not eating dinner at the bar and made it clear he was not pleased and did not want to serve us.,1
"The atmosphere, style and decor of this place is amazing. I wish the food was just as good! Our servers were so attentive and friendly and our water glasses always stayed full.

Burgers: the meat is tender, but the burger as a whole lacks flavor. Fries are good.

Butter Chicken Curry: This was yummy! My only complaint is that there wasn't enough curry and it definitely did not have enough spice. The chicken was so tender though - delicious.

Sticky toffee pudding: This was good, but the toffee sauce is definitely a little too sweet.",3
Good food!  Great service!,5
"Fast service excellent presentation! I had the Shirmp Lobster rolls with a Virgin Mojitos !
Kind off pricy but well worth the experience!",5
"Great food, great service. Wellington was awesome.",5
"Best meal I had in Vegas! Service was impeccable, drinks were outstanding, and the food was dynamite! Get the 3 course meal and leave feeling happy and stuffed. I'll be coming back here next time I'm in Vegas.",5
I really enjoyed this place. I had a BLT with housemate potato chips that was tremendous. The bartenders are also very welcoming.,5
Nice place for cocktails. Vegas prices :),5
"For those who may watch Kitchen Nightmare, you must visit one of the Gordon Ramsey restaurants!
Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill is a nice restaurant, good vibe and just relax at this place

Steam mussels was good, very little spicy at the end with a note of the evaporated beer, mussels were just right Texture  (not raw and not over cooked)

Pork Belly was ok, the skin can be more crispy

Lobster and Shrimp rolls are highly recommended, my favourite for the night",5
"I went during happy hour and it was the best thing I did. I tried their slider, wings and fries. All at a great price. They also have beer specials and I took advantage of it. You have to sit at the bar area but I didn’t mind. The bartenders where always checking up on me and the service was very quick. The food was delicious. I like extremely spicy food and thought that the wings would be not spicy at all. However, to my surprise it had a little kick and the flavor was delicious. I would love to have more of those wings. The slider was also very good. The bread was soft and the meat was cooked perfectly. The fries were fresh and crunchy. Next time I’m in Vegas I will come back. You can’t beat the happy hour prices.",5
Amazing food. The beef Wellington was just as delicious as it looks on Hell's Kitchen!,5
"Our waiter was super awesome. Very attentive. The food was fantastic! Steak cooked perfectly, and way more than I could eat",5
No wait time when we went. Price was high but that should be expected in both Vegas and at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Reviews on what we ordered. Butter Chicken Curry was fantastic had quite a kick to it which I enjoyed. Burger was seasoned well and juicy. Fries were average. Prime Rib was cooked perfectly for this guest. Wellington was perfection. Flaky breading and the meat was juicy and delicious. Would definitely go again,5
Really good food...especially for a chain restaurant. The staff was super friendly and accommodating of a large group.,5
Very Average Food for the 💰 Don't waste your $$$.,3
We went in one night for dinner. No wait at all on a weeknight visit. Had the fish and chips and rotisserie chicken. The sticky toffee pudding is wonderful.,5
"This particular restaurant of his specializes in English pub food. So you get your steaks, fries, shepherd's pie, many others. All very enticing as you look over the menu. I appreciated the quick service with the attentive staff to my water and other amenities!
The Wellington is out of this world and the short ribs were amazing, the Sticky toffee pudding for desert is the perfect ending to an wonderful experience.",5
I can’t even describe how amazing the food is. I wish I could give them more stars. I would order everything if I could. They have the best nachos I have ever tasted. The bartender made the most perfect blue Hawaiian. The drinks 50/10. The food 100/10. The service 20/10.,5
"Not many Vegan options, the beef wellington was dry, the mushy peas were gross also. The truffle fries and the asparagus were good. Dissapointed.",3
"One of, if not the best dinners I've ever had the Cesar salad was flavorful and fresh. The beef welington lived up to it's hype and a delicious dessert of sticky toffee pudding was to die for. The waiter was super nice and friendly. Overall everything was amazing, the only thing was missing was the man himself.",5
The filet was awesome the sides are big enough to share. Fantastic place,4
Was seated by uninterested hostess. Opened the menu and was shocked by the prices. Fish and Chips 32.00 was the cheapest and it went up from their. To spend a 100.00 per person for lunch in what was basically an open air pub is ridiculous we left as the food selection was poor as well.,2
"Inside Caesar's Palace is Gordon Ramsay's pub style restaurant. Food was good, reasonable price. Service was excellent.",5
It was good just a bit expensive.  Had the prime rib and my wife had filet minor.  Both were good.,4
"I wAs very disappointed with the food. Being a Gordon Ramsey fan I was expecting the food to be a lot better. The bacon burger was not up to my expectation, the burger itself lacked taste and was dry. My son had the chicken sandwich which was also not very good, the chicken was dry and burnt. However my wife had the beef Wellington which was extremely good.We also had the lobster and shrimp rolls which were beyond good. The food is pricey.",3
"This is quite possibly one of the best meals I've ever had. I enjoyed the Beef Wellington and a dessert of Sticky Toffee Pudding, two of Chef Ramsay's specialties!
Don't let the redness of the meat turn you off, it's worth it.",5
"We've been here before for dinner. So we were prepared for the wait time, price and all that. What we didn't know (or expect) was that there were certain items that were only available for dinner, but not lunch☹ But, you live and learn. And now we know. Not enough to ruin the trip or experience.",4
"I loved Roger and everything about this place. Literally the best restaurant and made my vacation. The food was perfect, and the service was out of this world. I've never had such nice and friendly staff. 100% a must if you're in Vegas.",5
Had a great meal and a great time.,5
A+ experience,5
"It's been 5 weeks now since visiting. First great big shout to our server Chris, he was fantastic.  Second being served meat without a steak knife and not needing  a steak knife was great.

I'll be in again next round through Vegas!",5
Had the fish and chips. Would not recommend. My fish was not cooked properly it was still Raw,2
"Ahhhhhh! As a Hell's Kitchen fanatic, it's always been my dream to come to one of Gordon's restaurants! The Beef Wellington did not disappoint! And the sticky toffee pudding was TO DIE FOR 🤤 Our waiter seemed to disappear, but Sara took over and she was AMAZING! Absolutely loved the experience ❤ The only thing that would've made it better is if Scott was here and came by!! Definitely will be back next time I'm in Vegas!!",5
"This place served the best fish and chips i had..it was not too oily and the taste was perfect..
The butter chicken curry was delicious and the portion was nice. It was a pleasant quick stop for me...",5
Horrible owner. Won't go there unless this 76 year old can get him in a fighting ring.,1
"I’m giving this restaurant a 4 in large part due to the excellent service. Our lobster roll appetizer was delicious, and so was the sticky toffee pudding dessert. However, our entrees were lackluster. I had a pub burger which was good but the bun was so heavy with butter it had me peeling it apart to eat it. My husband had fish and chips which were honestly flavorless even with vinegar. It was on ok experience, but not worth $100. His Burger restaurant at Planet Hollywood is MUCH better.",4
The food was simply amazing!!! The chairs incredibly comfortable. The service great!! The highlight of our visit? Our server Slajdan. Soooo awesome!! Attentive but not annoying!! We wish we lived here so we could visit again. Shout out to Stanley Slajdan work partner who was wonderful too!! Gordon please make time to recognize these two gentlemen!!,5
"Food was tasty, but service was really slow. Probably due to short staff. Too expensive, but that Vegas",4
"Had the fish an chips. Solid dish and good service. Was a little pricey for somewhat basic fair, but not disappointed.",4
A fantastic place for upscale pubgrub. This place is classic in design and the food has been well thought out.,5
Over priced steak. I always order a well done steak and it no matter where on vacation.  I go and get a steak  and most of the time.  If I order well it seems to always be on the dry side with very little flavor. And yes I understand most chefs are told or should I say believe a well done steak is disrespectful to the cut. However I'm a chef and I can cook a flavorful juicy well done steak. It may be because I've been cooking longer I don't know the skill level of your shifts. And I mean no disrespect. Overall the restaurant was a great experience I would just order something else when I go back because I will come back. But no for the cut that I got in the way it was cooked I would say it was overpriced. Again let me reiterate the experience was beautiful everyone in the restaurant was perfect.,1
"The service was great from the host to the server. I ordered the fish and chips and my friend ordered a medium rare burger. The burger was great and the fries were similar to McDonald's fries, so they were great. The fish and chips were good. The fish crispy and tender... lots of grease (obviously), but I loved it. The fries were okay. My friend ate those. The mushy peas were disappointing. It almost seemed like soup. Just wished it was better for the price we paid.  Nice ambiance.",3
"We had 4 guests who each ordered a different meal and all 4 were outstanding!

The chicken in the Caesars salad was fabulous!

Service was exemplary

Love this place",5
"A lot of beer selections
Great food and best calamari!
The service is good and fast",4
"The service is great. I ordered the salmon entree', I wasn't impressed. It looks really good though. I would have rated this place a 3/5, but I tried my husband's Shepard's pie, and it was delicious. I was also pleased with the lemon tart I ordered.",4
"Everything Gordon makes is phenomenal, that goes without saying. Yet I have to mention those nachos, omg by far the best I've ever had.",5
This was the best dinner I have ever had. The appetizer and the main course was outstanding. But the dessert was the best. I have never had anything taste so good!,5
"Upscale British pub in Caesars Palace. Came here on a Friday night before heading out to Hakkasan. It’s a quick walk to Omnia so it would be good place to hang before then. We came in a group of three and split three appetizers. The poutine was good, although I felt the gravy could’ve could’ve used a tad more salt and the cheese curds weren’t chewy. However I really liked the cut of the fries and how well-done they were. I preferred the nachos which also had nice chunks of short rib which were juicy and tender. The chips also held up well against the cheese and didn’t get soggy even towards the end of the meal. The hummus wasn’t worth it in my opinion, and you don’t have enough bread for the amount of hummus you get. If you check in on yelp, you do get a free sticky toffee pudding (which makes it taste even sweeter). They do take credit cards and there’s WiFi through the Caesars. There are bathrooms available in the back. Overall it’s a good spot to grab a drink or a light dinner before going out to the club.",4
"We had the fish and chips twice they were so good!! Service was amazing, especially Sarah 😊",5
Loved their 🐠 and chips but not worth for the price!,3
Had the braised short rib.  Insanely tender and absolutely delicious. The cabbage and Yukon potatoes were equally tasty. But come on it's Gordon Ramsay...,5
The food and atmosphere was good..  Be warned this place is very expensive though.,4
Well I think Gordon Ramsay is really the Gordon's fisherman that about as good as it was. For such a big name he could have done way better not worth the time and or the money.,1
"We ordered the Lobster Rolls with a side salad. Definitely Not impressed. Largely shrimp and salad fixings, side salad was poor imitation too. One of our group got sick. Will never go there again",1
"Tbh didn’t meet my expectations considering he’s a world-class chef, but still an excellent restaurant",4
Gordon Ramsay is one of my favorite chefs and this was the first time at one of his restaurants and I was not disappointed at all. The lobster shrimp rolls were amazing. The shepard's pie and the salmon were both extremely delicious. Our waiter recommended the sticky toffee pudding and that was a sweet finish to a great experience.,5
The food was delicious had a reservation for 8.30pm and had to wait over 30min for pur table other then that it was great.,4
"Worst experience in my entire Vegas trip!! The service was extremely slow, it took them 45 mins to give us water.. during lunch service while there wasn’t many other customers. I ordered the fish and chips, the chips were very soggy, didn’t have any seasoning, I had to ask for salt. I would not recommend going here, not worth the price at all!
I was expecting more coming from a Ramsey restaurant, I absolutely love the pub in England. Save the money, and go to England before Las Vegas!",1
Absolutely amazing!,5
Love Gordons shows was really excited to eat at one of his restraunts.... complete let down service was horrible they did not even bring an ice tea and a pepsi at the same time brought 1 then the other 10 min later and had like 5 different servers and for just me and my wife... we will never eat at this pub and grill again,1
"Honestly,  not impressed at all.  The restaurant was cool and everyone was very friendly.   But, the fish and chips were significantly over-priced for $30.99; I understand it's Las Vegas and everything seems higher priced.  However,  the fish was just okay, nothing to write home about,  the fries were soggy and the mashed peas just looked like they belonged somewhere other than on the plate.",2
"The food here will give your palate one hell of a party! We ordered seared scallops, lobster roll, 3 pub bites  (Mac n cheese, pork rinds, smoke salmon toast), sticky toffee dessert, and all the food were on point! The scallops were huge and seared perfectly with perfect seasoning. The lobster toppings on the roll were generous and while the roll is usually the side kick, I must say it tasted so good that it can stand alone! All 3 pubs bites give a good range of savory to delicate flavoring so there are definitely options to suit your mood of the day. And the sticky toffee pudding is to DIE for - soooo good!

While the food is amazing the service is truly exceptional. A special shout to Randall (Randy) who epitomizes great customer care and experience. He was friendly, personal, attentive and made us feel extremely welcomed. A definite gem in the service industry and a great asset to GR service team. The food is great but it is such service that made our visit memorable and earned a definite returned customers in us.

The service and food at GR pub & grill delivered such oomph that I left Vegas happy and.... round.",5
"These folks are hard working, especially the bartenders. Food was pretty good though like most stuff in Vegas, not a great value. If you don’t want to spend $70 on fish & chips and a couple of beers, don’t eat in Vegas",4
"Came here for Valentine's Day and place was full but not packed. Our server was Daisy and she was awesome.  We ordered 2 drinks from the bar, the pub crawl (Wow, what a drink) and an old fashioned but with Jameson, can't remember the name on that one. Then ordered the poutine for app and it was good but not great. We finished it all because we were starving. Our entree were the salmon and the lamb shank. Both well seasoned.  My only complaint is the garnishes for the salmon were a tad cold. I think it was the fennel and the mashed potatoes. Moving onto dessert we got the sticky toffee pudding - free with yelp check in 😊 and ended our night with some coffee and espresso courtesy of the house because they forgot about it lol but no big deal. Overall, the food was a bit pricey but great experience at our first Ramsay restaurant.",4
"All other Gordon Ramsey places are good this one specifically is trash. Management doesn’t know what they are doing, when things go wrong, they blame the customer. And it’s not even pulling the “customer is always right card” they just won’t own up to their mistakes. Avoid this place.",1
"Omg this place is phenomenal!! We started with the crispy calamari and it was the best calamari I’ve ever had.  The dipping sauce that accompanied it was equally as good!  I ordered the Braised rib.... oh my goodness.  It was perfection and everything I was expecting it to be!!!  I don’t even remember what my husband ordered, but he also loved my dish!  For dessert we had the sticky toffee cake and it was...... the best dessert ever.  Never had a dessert like it!  The service was great and the restaurant is very nice!  I absolutely recommend this restaurant!",5
Definitely British food and tastes but the blueberry specialty drink they serve up is phenomenal!! The staff even gave me a to go cup. Service was excellent. It's pricey but that's Vegas baby!,4
"Great people, food, beverages. Wellington was not on the mark.",3
Delicious appetizers and entrees. Simple pub fare with an upscale twist.,5
Service was nothing like I would have expected. Also the cabbage that came in my plate was not cooked well. The beef short rib was at least cooked perfect.,3
Good choice of beer. Perfect food. Recommend,5
Everything was so delicious! And beautifully presented,5
Ate at the bar. Great steak with bernaise.,5
Wonderful staff and incredible food made this an excellent experience!!,5
My wings lacked flavor. My friend had an excellent lobster roll. Not anywhere close to my favorite Vegas pub.,4
"To much Cesar salad and no fresh ground pepper, beef willington was to salty, and friend had a piece of paper in his toffee pudding",2
"Food was ok,  but nothing to write home about.  Service was good and friendly",3
"Service was horrible.
Took over 50 min for me to get my main course after i ordered..
I won’t be back..",1
"Enjoyed the food and ambiance. Our bar tender was a very nice guy having passion for the food and how it should be cooked. One of the best burgers I had. The fries was below average. We should have listened to our waiter to add truffle sth. Two beers , two burger with one salad, our bill came at $90. Recommend but reserve before going. They did not have walk in policy at 7pm although there were a few open table so we sat in the bar.",4
"exactly what you'd expect from a gordon ramsay establishment, which is absolute greatness. an outstanding dining experience, made even better by the staff,  who'd have your drink refill in hand before you even had to ask. a deserving 5 stars!",5
"The food was really good. We did the 3 course lunch the only thing was the soup was not the best but the salad has really really good flavors beef wellington good as always and the toffe pudding is extremely good. Wings are a must have,  very comfortable restaurant waiter was really nice too.",5
The food is amazing! The prime rib was very very tender. Staff are very professional. I would definitely come back. Keep up the good work!,5
"Very good service but food is in the regular franchise category. Don't fall on the Gordon Ramsay hype, foodwise this is as good as a Chilli's.",3
Had the beef wellington with the paired drinks. One of the best plates I've had the pleasure of eating.,5
"Beer was good and service was good but the burger was nothing special, except for the price! I've never paid $27 for a burger and I've had $10 burgers that were better.",2
Definition of perfection.  Magnificent experience,5
"Great food and great service. Got the fish and chips and wedge, yummm! Wish we could have met gordan; that would have been the icing on the cake! We will back.",5
"Dined here twice while staying at Caesars Palace. In my opinion, the food is quite appropriately priced for the quality. The service I received was prompt and courteous both times I went. First visit was before peak dinner time so it wasn't busy, but the second visit the restaurant was packed and waitress was still  very attentive.

Now about the food, my favourites would definitely have to be the lobster rolls (starter) and sticky toffee pudding dessert. They were standouts in that they were the best lobster rolls I've ever had. The lamb burger was cooked to my liking and delicious as well, but ordinary. Nothing that special.",4
"Our bartender, Mike was totally engaging and it was definitely a delight to have him serve us.  The nachos were amazing and Mike was super knowledgeable about all the beer that we love. What a fabulous experience!",5
Food was amazing...staff very friendly and tentative,5
"3.5 stars. Now normally I avoid places like this because they are usually overpriced for a mediocre quality of food. But we had $100 to spend on dinner and Hell's Kitchen was not on our possible options, so we went to the next best GR restaurant in Vegas. Located inside Caesar's Palace, it is next to the food court and the Caesar's rewards. The decor and architecture is quite chic pub like. They have multicolored barrels creating a partition which is a cool idea. In the back is an Eng village pub feel with wallpapered wall and a fireplace with a mantelpiece.
We didn't have to reservations but got seated immediately. Looking over the menu, I do have to say, there aren't a lot of options for vegetarians and chicken lovers. We wanted to stick to the GR signatures (cz we are only doing this once!). And those signatures included 4 red meat options, a salmon and a scallop option.
So since chicken was out, I decided to go with the Scottish salmon and my boyfriend decided on the braised short rib. We got the calamari for an appetizer.
The calamari was good! Crispy, tasty, albeit a little salty and decently sized. The addition of peppers on it was a good touch.
I was a little underwhelmed by the salmon. Broke off beautifully and was obviously well-cooked. But I love my flavours and it was quite bland. The veggies in the cream sauce around was a decent touch. But, maybe add some pepper?
The short rib, again, broke off beautifully. In fact, my boyfriend did not need to use a knife! But he wasn't seeing stars with it. At times, it had a slight burnt taste. The veggies and mashed potatoes on the side were decent.
Because of our yelp check-in, we got a free sticky toffee pudding - a desert lover's (not me) delight! It's a hefty sized thing, so easily something to be shared by 3-4 people. It was good, but got quite heavily sweet towards the end.
All in all, pricing of the food matches the restaurant name but I cannot give the food more than 3-3.5 stars. Guess I was looking for more spices from the GR recipes!",4
"Ordered lobster roll and wings.  Thought it would be decent but very disappointing.   Lobster roll was ok but too much mayo and lobster didn't have lobster flavor, felt like out of can food.  The wings was so dry that I only could eat 2 out of a dozen.  The sauce was ok but for the price you pay, it wasn't worth it.  I would say, it's 7 eleven's snack food with Gordon Ramsay's name on it.",2
We were so excited to come have lunch here and we left truly DISAPPOINTED. I ordered the bacon burger with the fries and when I opened my burger to put the mayonnaise on the bun it had MOLD on it 🤮 I then show it to the waitress who was amazing and she told me the chef said it was grill marks lol green grill marks?! I don’t think so! We all know what mold looks like on bread and it was definitely MOLD. I wish I had taken a picture to share on my post. My husband ordered the fish which he didn’t care for. Maybe we expected too much but it’s GORDON RAMSAY!!,1
"Great ambiance, the staff was amazing and excited to help. Needless to say the food was absolutely magnificent.",5
"Hamburger- very dry & cooked medium rare (asked for medium well).
Artichoke dip- a bucket of thick hard cheese.
We wouldn't return. The ambiance is ehh.",1
Food was delicious!,5
Had to wait a little bit to get in even with a reservation but the food was fantastic!,4
Sarah was super friendly and amazing at helping to navigate us through our experience.  The onion and Ale soup was Rich & Hearty. Gruyere cheese sends it over the top. We had to have the Hell Fire wings were a perfect balance of sweet and heat .. and of course needed to have the signature sticky toffee pudding was decadent.,5
Very poor service!  Sat at table for 20 minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there. Then when we received our food the steak was awful and no one came around to fill our drinks or even acknowledge we were there. I spent 135 dollars there for two people and had zero service unless I flagged them down. Terrible I should get a full refund but we all know that’s not going to happen. My loss but I will not recommend this place to anyone.,1
Fantastic pub with a vibrant atmosphere and great food I opted for lobster Mac n Cheese which didn't disappoint it was delicious and the beer served was cold and crisp! All in all a great visit! Well done team GR!,5
Our server Tessla was the best and the food was delicious. We were not disappointed.,5
Great fish and chips! Top knotch atmosphere!,5
"Love his other restaurants.  So we were excited.  Fish and chips needed seasonings (the food was bland),  overall not nearly the standard we expected. With so many other choices in Las Vegas, we will not be back.",1
"The restaurant had a fun English pub feel. The menus there like clip board. There is a bar and lots of TVs. The food was good. We started with some calamari and it was really good. We got scallops and they had good flavor. I decided to try the beef wellington. It was pretty good. I would go back.
The prices are high, but normal for Las Vegas.",5
Awesome food.,5
Good food. Fries were a bit on the oily side and the pita bread for the dip was very hard. Good service.,4
Food is fabulous!,4
"Poor quality food and chef. Dry chicken, tough filet migon. Obviously not managed properly. Avoid here, go to Giada!!!!",1
"Expensive, but actually tasty food and not bad place.",5
"The food was tasty and the portion sizes substantial. My wedge salad was enough for two people to share. The fish in the fish and chips had a  fluffy batter and the spicy wing had a subtle sweetness. The specialty alcoholic drinks are overpriced at nearly $20, but taste great",4
"The food was excellent, but sometimes we had trouble getting the servers attention. I think she was just really busy",4
The food here is mediocre at best. Ordered artichoke dip and it tasted like the artichokes were canned. It was cold and had no flavor. We ordered the pub burger and fish and chips and they were both disappointing. I sent my burger back the first time because the bacon was so badly burnt and the beef patty was raw. (Ordered medium). Both of our items were lacking flavor. Not worth $70. That’s after they removed the burger. Our server was wonderful and I would give him 5 stars. I’ve been to other Gordon Ramey restaurants and this was very disappointing.,2
"A good meal here but shy of great. The fish and chips had great fish (crisp, well seasoned) and poor chips (not crisp at all, room temperature). The wedge salad was great. My friend really enjoyed the Scotch egg and bangers and mash. Service was adequate: it took a bit too long for the first beer to come out. Usual Vegas pricing applies here.",4
"I mean, the food was pretty good... but the experience left a lot to be desired honestly.
Oh well, had to try it and see what it was about.",3
They served me rare beef wellington at room temperature. Absolutely revolting. They couldn't keep the wine pairings in sync either. Completely disappointed.,1
Very good food and service.,5
"Busy pub, but worth every penny. Food was immaculate and service was great.",5
Always great service and the food is exceptional. I always have to finish with the sticky toffee pudding cake. It is to die for.,5
How can you have one main dinner you serve . And it wasn't even all that . Hell can i just have a porterhouse n good veggies . Basically appetizers we average nothing upscale that you would expect from his name on it (chef what ?? where??). Folks should check up on there establishments smh no variety just hype my opinion which I'm sure doesn't count he'll never read this 😂😆,2
It was good but I can make cabbage better at home,4
"Ate Here Twice! Yes, That Good for Pub Food

Let me start by saying I am. hell's kitchen fan and have been watching on Internet for some time and therefore expectations are high, coupled with I have eaten many ""high dollar"" chef meals. I sometimes question peoples experiences in life when I see bad reviews about a place we eat at and enjoy. That said, our family experience could not have been better. The waitress was very helpful, timely, and even spoke in my wife's and mother-in-law's foreign dialogue after we had our main meal. We basically just ordered appetizer's and shared between the 3 of us (about a $100 with tip). On our first visit we had Lobster rolls, Pigs in a blanket, calamari, non alcoholic drinks, water, and for dessert an espresso and the infamous toffee pudding. Everything was delicious and cooked properly. Worth noting, according to the server, Gordon Ramsay visited a week prior so we just missed him and that may have impacted our meal and experience. The second visit a couple of nights later for a just before closing included Tiger shrimp, buffalo wings, deviled eggs, bacon cheddar burger & fries and a Danny Boy. Favorite is the sausage in the pig and blanket. Danny boy was a strong drink, I ordered 2 and was set for the night ($150 or more because of drinks). I would recommend and eat here again from what I experienced. As the ultimate restaurant question goes ""Would you eat here again?"" if yes, you can't go wrong and will stay in business. Thanks for reading and if it helps give a thumbs up.",5
OMG! This food is to die for! It's so good I haven't had a better meal from a pub until here. It's upscale and new it's one of Gordon Ramsey's better restaurants. I am also going be trying his hells kitchen restaurant but this is the best pub ever. I Highly recommend the fish and chips and nachos.,5
"The hostess and waitress Yaneis were awesome. Very friendly and personable. We were here for our anniversary, and they all told us Happy Anniversary. The food was great and tasty. The sticky toffee pudding was incredible. I highly recommend this place to anyone.",5
Burger was cooked perfectly however the bun was not toasted at all. The tomato soup was definitely on point. This is a great place at Caesar's Palace to grab a bite. I would recommend this experience.,4
"Awesome food and great atmosphere!

On a recent trip to Las Vegas, NV, my husband and I had the opportunity to stop in at Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill. Located in Cesar's Palace, where we stayed, it was the perfect chance to stop for a bite to eat. We both enjoy watching Chef Ramsay on his various tv shows.

All the choices on the menu were great and sound delicious. I was so tempted to order his signature dish, Beef Wellington, but I did not.  We will just have to make another trip so that I can make that selection the next time around.

After reading over the menu a few times, my husband and I made our decisions. To start, we had the deviled eggs. For our entrees, my Husband ordered the Fish and Chips and I decided on the 8 oz English Cheddar Beef Burger with bacon. Of course to go along with our meals, we ordered a couple Bloody Marys. AMAZING!!!!!! We have tried Bloody Marys at several places on our adventures, but we have to say that the Bloody Marys at This Pub and Grill has taken a front seat for that particular cocktail. So, we ordered a second round, after the meal.

When our plates arrived, and we took the first bite we were both very pleased with our selections. My husbands Fish and Chips were delicious and the burger was spot on. The Fish was lightly breaded and still firm inside, and the burger was cooked to my specifications - med rare. Just delicious.

The atmosphere was great - cool English pub. Our Waiter, Afro, that is what was on the check, was very attentive but not to the point where it is annoying. He was professional with a great personality! Thanks again, Afro!

If you have a chance, try Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill in Las Vegas, Cesar's Palace. I am quite sure you will agree the food is delicious and the atmosphere is cool.",5
He got the short rib. I got fish and chips. Dessert was for my birthday. Warm cake and icecream! Delish!!,5
"The food was beyond amazing! I've never had mashed potatoes so creamy and smooth, the beef wellington melted in my mouth, and the toffee bread was so incredibly delicious. It was worth every penny and I can't wait to visit again.",5
"I’m not a burger type of person, I don’t like to eat meat just anywhere but this place is the best!! They have this delicious white sauce that goes perfect with your burger. The truffle fries I didn’t like much because they have a strong taste but overall everything else was on point! Will be coming back soon! Gordon you are a food god!",5
Amazing food. The staff was amazing,5
"The food and drinks were good but in a nice place like this, starring an iron / master chef, the service could have been much better! We were never checked on. Only to get the check.",4
Great service from bartenders! Lovely atmosphere and creative setting. Homemade mustard with the pretzels was delish!,5
"I'm a fan girl, of England and of Gordon. My butter chicken curry would have made any Brit proud. Impeccable service. Great food. I would revisit.",4
"I really enjoyed the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. It is somewhat styled after an english pub and what brought me here wad the fish and chips.

They were very reasonably priced and you receive quite a large portion. My wife opted for truffle fries so the pics are not of the standard steak cut fries which I prefer. The ceasar salad with chicken was amazing as well!

The staff greeted us with a warm and friendly smile and the waiter had the food and drinks on our table in minutes. Outstanding service! Give athena try and you won't have any regrets.",5
The Lobster Pot Pie is Everything,5
"You MUST get the beef Wellington, simply amazing. Lives up to all the hype. If you're a fan of Gordon, check it off the list.",5
Delicious food great atmosphere and the dessert was delicious,5
Quite overpriced considering the food size and taste.,3
Good food. Friendly staff. Wedge Salad was delicious. As were the braised short ribs. 35 oz draft beers. Nice atmosphere.,4
"We were sat down rather quickly dor a.Sunsay evening, and the staff was nice. The dishes were really delicious, and the prices were okay (a bit expensive based on location [in Caesar's Palace] and the fact it is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant), but tasted really good, nonetheless. We ordered the truffle fries, the corner beef poutine, the beef Wellington, the house salad, the fried calamari, and the NY steak, and every one of us liked our dishes. They were prepared very well, but the truffle fries are very potent and very oily, so just a little heads-up on that. I think we will definitely come back if given the opportunity.",5
The best Filet Mingon...cooked perfectly. Great atmosphere too. We walked right in and got a table immediately while many other restaurants were either booked full or closed.,5
"Gordon Ramsey Pub and Grill located in Caesars palace is WAY too over priced! Gordon's was too over priced for food that was not worth the money at all.  Unlike Buddys Vs Ristorante located in the grand canal which is great on good and price! We had the ravioli, Caesar salad, and cheesy garlic bread! The pizza looked awesome and well worth the price!",2
"Extremely disappointing  I don't mind being critical here because this is Ramsay and we pay premium because of his name  Ramsay needs to spend some time here and get standards up to par. First, insane prices. $30 something for fish and chips and was poorly cooked. My guess is the oil they fry in was not hot enough as the breading was mushy. The fish inside was ok but couldn't eat it because of the mushy exterior. Their fried chicken sandwich was mediocre at best. Clains it's spicery but wasn't.  Chicken fry and not juicy like it should be. Lastly for a pub that emphasizes beer, they had the worst selection of beer. Almost all mainstream beer and no local craft. Oh and bar had tons of fruit flies to top it off. Their saving grace for a 2 star was their bartender and manager were great and at least comped an overpriced drink for the problems with food.",2
Absolutely amazing...,5
"The food was terrific, reasonably priced, the staff was excellent, and the three course meal was exactly the right thing.",4
Good but not what I was expecting. I prefer a medium rare steak.,4
"Great atmosphere, quality food and top notch service.  Our waitress Daisy was the best ever!  She was very knowledgable with the menu and attentive.  A model employee and great person.  A definate asset to the business.
The sheppards pie was better than I hoped for and the sticky toffee pudding was light and delicious.  I think I cried a bit when the food was all gone.  Good job and I highly recommend!",5
"I was so excited to come here for my boyfriends birthday as he loves this man dearly. We were sat at a 2 top table in the back. We sat down and a few minutes later the hostess sits another couple down. We wait a minute and a waiter comes over and says “Hello water to start”. We politely say yes please that’s fine as we are still looking over the menu. He says nothing. He continues to the newly seated table next to us with a big grin on his face and says “Hello Welcome can I get you 2 some water” they say yes as we did, but then he actually engaged in conversation with them asking how’s their day and if he could do anything to help with the menu. I overheard all this. I try to brush it off. As it’s a pandemic going on they want you to scan the code and look over the menu. Both myself and my boyfriend were doing  this as the waiter saw, and so was the table next to us. He ask the table next to us if they wanted a paper menu to make it easier for them to see. That was it I had had it and gave up. If he didn’t want to wait on us because we were black then he’s in the wrong industry. I will be telling anyone who listens never to visit this restaurant. Very disappointed.",1
"What an incredible lunch, Food and service was top notch. Wish he would open one up in San Antonio,  Texas.
WILL COME BACK FOR SURE.",5
"Food was good, prices were ok for Vegas, especially some of the appetizer and snack options if you're looking for a light bite. The food quality was very good. We had the Mimi Mac n cheese and the nachos. Both were delicious. The table next to us had the beef wellington, which looked liked it was cooked to perfection...Gordon would have been satisfied with it for sure! Good beer list of looking for for a pint. Service was a tad on the slow side and you're right next to slot machines if you're table is near the entrance.",4
"Our first time in Vegas and we wanted to try one of Ramseys spots. Make the reservation!!! Went during lunch. Hubs loved the wellington combo. Lobster rolls were delish - you couldn't even tell it was seafood (if you're like the hubs who doesn't like the ""ocean"" smell). Hellfire wings were very good too. We hope to return, but for dinner next time.",5
Beef Wellington. Absolutely amazing 😋😋😋,5
"Fabulous service since we walked in to the time we left. Food was amazing, clean atmosphere, polite waiter, fast service. Rodney was awesome. Thank you so much",5
If only I could photograph flavour. Our meal was amazing. Service could have been better but it was very busy and I've had way worse. Our server was apologetic but I know she was doing her best.,5
It's good but far from great. Plan on putting out about $25 per person for lunch.  And $50 for dinner. I do not need to go back.,4
Nice fish and chips and tasty hamburger.,4
This place was wonderful. We have always wanted to eat at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. It was a pub so pricing was easier on the wallet.,5
Good menu options my burger was on point thanks guys.,5
The food was great (don’t miss the toffee pudding!!!) but very very expensive.,4
Food was nothing special and over priced,3
First time experiencing gordon ramsay food and I was very pleased. Me and my queen both got the beef wellington and they were beyond words. Staff was very polite and inviting.,5
Good. For the price should be better. Did the pre-fix dinner with the wine pairing. Wine pairing was nice.,4
"Ordered grilled chx on the salad, the server acknowledged it but then brought out fried, found out they don't serve grilled chx. They did buy us our desert because of the miscommunication",3
"The fish was deep fried very well. The variety of dipping sauces and fries were good too. Well actually, we really enjoyed the fries. Perfectly crisp on the exterior. There can be a line, but make sure to secure seating. It got packed pretty quickly around 11:30 a.m. The iced peach lemonade was a bit too sweet for us, but flavorful.",4
"Had the short rib grilled cheese, truffle fries, hellfire wings, lobster & shrimp roll. Everything was great. Wings were juicy and not overcooked, short rib sandwich was very tender and the upgrade truffle fries (+3.00) was worth it. Will definitely be back.",5
"The Shepard's pie was a huge letdown. In the chefs own words ""it was a greasy gloopy mess, you muppet"". The other items were fantastic though, especially the cocktail.",4
Omg I had the best burger of my life thanks chef Gordon Ramsey and everything was delicious,5
"Great staff, food was good, vibe of the place sucks. For food places in that area of Caesars palace it is the best reasonably priced sit down option.",4
Mac and cheese was super tasty.  Burger was decent.  Little sloppy but flavor was good.  Excellent fries.  Cool atmosphere but music was a little loud.,5
"Great tasting food of course, awesome service.",5
The food was great. I wasn't expecting such great food selections and service from a pub and grill. The lamp shanks were awesome. I will return,5
Prime rib was awesome! Wait was high with plenty of staff....,5
"Upon our arrival in Vegas we were both excited to try this.  Waiting 3 days to find just the right time to have a seat inside as its very cold this time of year.  Portion was definitely enough. The abundance of sauces offered was a nice touch.  Fish was fresh made after we ordered, it was good.(😕 nothing special or flavoring used) The fries and sauces were the best part. 🤔🐟🍟. About 20 minutes after eating here we took turns in and out of bathroom for the rest of the evening.",3
"Food was great! Restaurant is nice. We split a burger, fries and lobster rolls.",5
"Food is simply amazing. Actually, quite afordable considering the quality of the food and the service. Worth the visit. ❤️",5
Delicious food! We had to wait a little while to get a table but it wasn't that long.,4
"What can you say, its a Gordon Ramsey. It was perfect.",5
Good food,4
Absolutely amazing food. Great experience as expected. Staff is very helpful and knowledgeable ! Food is Amazing !,5
"Great food, great service and one of the best burgers I ever ate.",5
Absolutely amazing! Great food and Great service!,5
"Just stopped for drinks, but good selection, excellent bartenders. Pricey, but expected in casino bar.",5
"Phenomenal food in a low-key sports pub atmosphere. I had the 3 course meal (caesar salad, beef wellington, and toffee pudding), and everything was to die for. I highly recommend saving room for dessert, as it's definitely worth it.",5
"Bellied up to the bar and received exceptional service. No wait for a seat. Ordered a few draughts, the chicken pot pie and the short rib. Upscale pub food was hot and delicious. Would recommend to everyone.",5
Great food and atmosphere. Staff is top notch. Always a good look for a lamb burger and tuffle fries. Pub & Grill is a quick and easy spot to get some grub and start the night.,5
We had a wonderful experience here. We came as a family for one of our son's 30th birthday. We had the three course meal and all 5 of us tried Beef Wellington for the first time. It was so delicious and cooked to perfection. The toffee pudding dessert was decadent. Would definitely do this again.,5
"We expected this to have more flavor, hence the name in the signage. Unimpressive. The food definitely needed simple seasoning: salt and pepper. Burger was not juicy. It felt like chewing peanut butter only on a sandwich with no drink. Fries are store bought from a bag. Salmon was super small slice, and definitely needed more seasoning! Our food was over $100. Definitely NOT worth the money! Service is friendly and professional! Old fashions are extremely OVERPRICED! The craft beer selection isn't great. We just expected a LOT more! Big letdown. Our appetizer, hellfire wings, was on point! We expected the food to be much better after such a tasty start. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. It is my birthday, so we were given a toffee dessert, which was absolutely delicious! So in other words, go with the appetizers and desserts, and you should be good 👍",3
Absolutely the best fish & chips I’ve had in my life! Plus the service was AMAZING!,5
Sorry Gordon I'm a big fan but food was just ok,2
"Came here a bit over a week ago while I was visiting Las Vegas for the first time. The food was great. I ordered a classic burger and fries, medium rare (I usually do Medium but I felt like if I ordered any other doneness Gordon himself would come out and beat me lol). For dessert, sticky toffee pudding (SERIOUSLY GET IT IF YOU COME HERE. IT'S AMAZING. DON'T SKIP IT).

But the best part about it was the service. All the waiters and waitresses were amazing. One in particular, I think her name was Melissa(?) (she had blonde hair) stopped to geek out with us over Gordon Ramsay for a bit before we left. It was a really fun conversation and solidified the whole experience with a great ending. Can't wait to visit Vegas again and come here again to try out different menu items and maybe have a fanboy discussion about the man himself again. :)",5
"They offer fried chicken and fried fish.... this is a Decent fish and chips shop and I liked that the fish wasn’t too oily. You get three pieces with a bunch of fries and a drink for approx $14 USD a box, from a price point it’s a great deal but the fish lacked seasoning. You have the option to choose 3 different sauces, I was a little curious to find out how Gordon Ramsey’s tartar sauce would Taste and I wasn’t really impressed with the tartar since it was bland and I mean zero taste... the mango curried sauce was pretty good (probably because I make the exact same sauce at home) but it pairs better with chicken rather than fish. They need to come up with a better sauce selection for the fried fish, a blackened sauce would be nice or just a zestier tartar sauce could save the day... think outside the box! Make your sauces more interesting and alive.
4 stars for overall quality of ingredients used, the seating area, the store presentation, speed of service, cost and location on the vegas strip.",4
"The food is delicious and the customer service is something that should be emulated, especially by those restaurants with fierce competition in markets fueled by tourism.",5
Fantastic food and atmosphere. Steak and mashed potatoes were incredible. I ate here for the third time recently and wouldn't hesitate to venture back in next time I'm in town as well.,5
"Very loud. Food was good, service was good, prices too high.",4
Charlie and Ramone will take good care of you and the food is great.,5
"TLDR: Thoroughly disappointed with quality

We ordered Waygu filet, kale salad, Calamari and the (now in)famous beef Wellington.

The calamari arrived first. The pieces looked too brown as if re-fried and set under the heat lamp for hours. Our server warned the calamari was “extremely hot” when it was a few degrees above room temperature.

Next was Waygu fillet(~$45), we ordered it rare to experience the high skill set required to prepare the perfect steak. To our horror, it was lukewarm again like left on the counter for too long.

The server came over with another plate of calamari and we said ours came already. He served replied “oh that must be a mistake, this is yours.”

Next up, beef Wellington. It was again lukewarm. It seems as if all food in this restaurant were prepared beforehand and set under the heat lamp. There is absolutely no way fresh food can be prepared in such a short amount of time. We entered at 6:00 and exited at 6:40pm. 100% that the food wasn’t fresh but under heat lamp.

Thoroughly disappointed with the quality of food with a restaurant with Gordon Ramsey’s name on it. +1 for good service and friendly staff.",2
Sarah was our server and she was the absolute best. You can really tell she loves her job. Me and my girlfriend absolutely loved her. We will be back and she will 100% be our server.,5
"Food , drinks and service were top notch.",5
"So disapointed. I never seen rush service pushed to this extreme. Not even 2 minutes after we ordered that the apetizer arrived. I'm not expecting made to order but come on. We didnt have the time to finish our apps that the entrees arrived to our table. My girlfriend had the three course meal with beer pairing we had to almost chug the beers to keep up with the dishes. We were in and out in less than an hour which is a record.

Im a huge fan of gordon and it was amazing when we went a couple years ago to this pub. huge letdown this time. Food was ok, not as hot as it could be but ok. Makes me reconsider going back to a GR restaurant in the future.

To me it's a shame that Gordon Ramsey's name is attached to this restaurant.",1
I was so excited to dine for my birthday until we got to order. We ordered our burgers  🍔 well done only to get it burned on the outside and still very pink on the inside. I’m thinking maybe the grill was turned up too high. The waiter was also not engaged and barely wanted to refill our drinks. So disappointing. Totally NOT worth the money.,1
"We were here dinner time at July 27 2021 . We were excited to try this place. Unfortunately the food was underwhelming excluding the dessert.  It’s like this place wanted me to pay them over $100 per person in our party just to be treated badly.

The 3 hostess in the front were incredibly rude (look at similar reviews below)!
Like I’m just trying to have dinner, why do you have to be mean and give me attitude. To make things worse we stayed here for dinner for almost 2 hours because we were waiting for our food that took forever!

Our waitress was ok, but she did forget to give us utensils and we didn’t know where she was most of the time",2
"Finally got to visit one of Chef Ramsey's restaurants while vacationing in Las Vegas! Gordom Ramsey Pub in Caesar's Palace. The food was OUTSTANDING,  the service from our waitress Sarah, IMPECCABLE!! The braised short ribs with mashed potatoes melts in your mouth! The brussel sprouts were amazing!! Very nice portions!!",5
"Orders the shrimp and lobster rolls, but when they came out it was very small and was just a crab salad on a small piece of bread which had no flavor.  Next was the wedge salad which I thought was ridiculous to pay $18.99 for a salad but I was awesome and the portion size was enough for a meal itself. On to the main course, I ordered the short rib and cabbage and my husband had the prime rib.  The short rib was amazing but the cabbage was under cooked and still crispy with no flavor at all.  My husband's prime rib also had zero flavor and for $55.99 we were very disappointed. Overall I would say it's over priced for the quality of food you get.",3
"Absolutely fantastic place for a Vegas meal.

First off, you can price it off how you like. If you want some good food at a fair price, just get a burger, should be like 15 bucks a pop after tip.

If you're willing to get a little more spendy though, you're gonna have a good time. Waiters are professional and will treat you well. Get a good appetizer or bar bites, one of their incredible ""hard shakes"" (seriously these are amazing), a cocktail, and an entree, and yea, it'll cost you 50, 60 bucks, but it'll be worth it, and better that then losing it all in a single hand of blackjack (at least in my opinion).

You gotta pick well. The burgers are amazing, so is the curry. The pot pie is good but it won't blow your mind. The bangers and mash, eh. Get a good burger, get a good cocktail, and blow your money on the desert. The pudding whatever thing, it's highlighted all over their menu, get it. It's so good. The cocktails will knock you on your ass, too.

Basically, come here and have a good time, and spend a bit to have an even better time. Love it here, I come every time I'm in vegas. See my pics to get a better idea.",4
"I’ll admit my expectations of this place were probably too high, but I assumed Gordon Ramsey wouldn’t put his name on something that wasn’t top notch. The chips were incredible the perfect crispness and my husband really liked the southwest ranch dip. The fish is where it fell apart for me. The outside was crispy, but the inside batter was just too mushy and sticky. There was absolutely zero flavor to the batter either. It just left me really disappointed. The seating area inside is quite small, but the wait wasn’t too bad.",3
Water warm cob fish had no flavors tarter tasted old server had to be asked twice for a Pepsi frys were mash not chips,1
Food was awesome! Service was the best!,5
"Amazing! Great service,  great food! Beef Wellington was off the chain!",5
The food was terrible. I ordered a pub burger ($26.99) that showed up in 5 minutes but had clearly been sitting around for much longer as it was cold and was very undercooked. Needless to say I sent it back and again received a slightly more cooked luke warm burger.  I've received better Burgers at fast food restaurants. My friend ordered the French Onion soup which she said tasted like salted broth. She ate 2 bites and gave up.  The quality control is clearly not existant.  The service was average.  I expect a lot more from a place with the name Gordon Ramsey on it.  I will never return!!!,1
"Experience great, food okay. Fish and chips were cold.",3
Delicious food! I cannot wait to go back,5
"I recommend the prime rib and of course you have to try the beef wellington, you cant do a gordon ramsey restaurant otherwise",5
"The wings were very good.  The fries were fries, nothing special.  The pub burger might have been good at half the price.  It was a hamburger! Nothing else, nothing special.",2
Do yourself a favor and visit this place. The beef Wellington melts in your mouth. The service is second to none. I would suggest making a reservation because they are busy.,5
I have eaten at other Gordon Ramsay establishments and enjoyed it immensely. This time not so much. The ale onion soup was the best part of the meal. The Beef Wellington was cold and the pastry was hard to cut amd very soggy. The pate around the Wellington was tasteless in some areas and super salty in others. The sticky toffee pudding was ok. The service was great and prompt but the food and drinks left something to ve desired at that price.,2
I have to admit the food was alright at best but our server Adam made the experience a 10 out of 10  I would give this five stars for the service we received but there are way better options for the money.,3
"When I visited last time i  really liked this place so I took my friends here ,My friend ordered butter chicken curry it was ok but the fries were oily . brine Chicken , nachos and dessert were good .",3
"Good food
Great place with great portions.
A place to visit if ever in town.
Prices are reasonable especially for they are located at.
Staff is very friendly.
Can’t miss on trying out shrimp as well",4
Food was amezing no regrets staff was polite and attentive,5
Excellent service. Amazing food. Highly recommend.,5
Delicious food and excellent service.,5
Great food and excellent service. The tomato  soup was amazing. Thanks Elyse!,5
"Not a great place for vegetarians. No real options. The service here was great though. If you can't get a reservation online, it's worth showing up and seeing if they have free tables. The sticky toffee pudding is really good!",3
"We were here last Saturday night my son who is 9 had to eat here we tried Hell’s Kitchen last month. There was an hour wait not bad, my son ordered the pot pie. The sauce tasted like a thickened chef boy RD sauce. I ordered a side of french fries because it sounded good with the truffle oil they were soggy and limp. Server kind of leafed it off. Other than that everything else was good.",2
"What a fabulous place to eat, everything I ate from the wellington to the toffee was absolutely outstanding. Would highly recommend this place to anybody looking to have a more Luxurious type of meal.",5
"Big fan of Chef Ramsey was excited to go to one of his restaurants. We ordered fish & chip dinner; it was so salty we had to send it back. Replaced it with the short ribs, cabbage and mashed potatoes. The cabbage had no taste and was water logged. Service was fine, overall to spend that kind of money and be disappointed in both meals don’t think we will be going back anytime soon.",1
Amazing beef wellington and toffee sticky pudding,5
Food was absolutely delicious! Juana was our server and she was right on time for everything! I could not be more satisfied!,5
Great little restaurant. Bartenders are awesome in the food is great!,5
"Absolutely amazing, food was great and our waiter was very funny and attentive. Of course prices are a little high but people should expect that from a Ramsey resturaunt in Vegas. Highly recommend and without a doubt will visit again.",5
"Great spot with some delicious options. I had the lamb shank and it was absolutely perfect. Solid beer selection and the service was great. Prices aren’t as bad as some reviews claim. It’s high end food at a celebrity chef’s restaurant, expect to pay a solid amount.",5
"Food was 5 star! Everything was great, down to the beer on tap! Dessert was the best and a must!",5
Considering it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant with his name and prestige behind it I was very disappointed with the fish and chips they were bland no taste the french fries were cold the chicken sandwich that I got had nothing on it but bread and chicken and it was cold I'm very disappointed I will not go back. However our server  was great!,5
"Loved it! Service was spectacular everything was cooked to perfection. We had short rib nachos, so yummmy. The short rib and cabbage,  the cabbage still had the crunch that I like not over cooked at all. Josnin, our server was amazing and since I've been in Vegas he's the standard I'm holding all servers too. Highly recommend. Just go already.",5
"Food was great service was up to par, an the environment was nice. So yes we will come back. Thank you Ramsay!",4
The greatest food that I have ever had and to go with that great food was awesome service!,5
"I was excited to finally try the raved upon beef Wellington,  and I might add the waiter reminded me that it is served medium rare only. When it arrived it was grey and well done. I was totally surprised,  but I don't complain often,  so i just ate it. However, what all the rage is about beats me. Over priced and sub standard for beef Wellington. Won't be back anytime soon!",3
"Food was so ordinary. Gordon Ramsay himself would have sent it back. Most expensive food we’ve had since being in Vegas and most disappointing. This is a pub... my husband had what looked like  a microwaved steak with the weirdest tasting pepper sauce. Chips were weird tasting as well. I had a tiny little braised rib which was actually quite nice but very small. It was on a plate full of cabbage, this looked like half a cabbage was put in a boiler and wacked on the plate. One beer and two cocktails. $200 later... would not recommend and certainly will not go back. Waitress was lovely though. She gets the stars, not the food...",2
"Good food, great attention",5
Beef Wellington.  I have no words.  Bucket list item ...check.  I am still salivating.  Amazing service.,5
Good pub grub and a nice selection of beverages.,4
"Good service. Our food came quickly. We had the mini bacon burgers, macaroni and cheese, truffle fries, and sticky toffee pudding. Everything was good.",5
"This place is awesome! The pub burger is the best burger I ever eaten in my bar hoping life!
Service is superb, beers are amazing but the food... oh man! The food is great!
Highly recommended! You won't regret it!",5
"Ran into this restaurant after watching Mat Franco Magic at Linq. A casual eatery by Ramsay? I said, why not. I don't think he would put his name on just anything, right?

I got the Fish & Chips combo plus import beer for $20 including tax. I tried the Sam Smith Chocolate Stout. It was smooth and had creamy character. The chips (fries) were perfectly crisp and seasoned well. The fish (came with 3) was moist and the batter was hot with a good crunch. It lacked seasoning but I think that's the way they prep them because they do offer 2 kinds of sauces per order. I tried Siracha Aioli and Curry Mango. I prefer the Siracha cause it had just the right amount of kick.

Overall, the food quality was excellent and the service was very polite and professional. They do not have a lot of seating but this place is more of a fast food / to-go concept than a full-service restaurant.",4
My Wife and I ate there on Saturday. We got the short end. The ripped us off by selling us 1/2  beef Wellington each. This was horrible!! We'll never go back here again,1
We came in here for a quick bite to eat and a couple of drinks. Really cool style restaurant in the caesars palace. The drinks were good the food was good.,4
Exactly what you expect from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant-perfection.,5
"The food here was amazing. I had the beef wellington and could have cut it with a butter knife. The meat was warm throughout although I would have liked it to have been browned a little more.

Carrots were good and the asparagus was delicious just wish I had a little more. The mashed potatoes were good but could have used just a tiny bit more flavor and lumps lol.

The price was fair and well worth it for the quality of the meat.",5
Expensive but good food (nothing amazing) with decent service but nice busy Las vegas-ie ambiance right inside the casino.,4
"Excellent food, but very slow service.",4
Tried this after dining at Hell’s Kitchen. Great service and atmosphere. They also offer the tasting menu that they offered at Hell’s Kitchen but for a cheaper price (about 5 bucks less). Food is okay. Ordered a pesto chicken sandwich but the chicken was a tad dry,4
Upbeat atmosphere Awesome servers delicious food..I ate the exclusive and famous prime rib,5
Happy hour is a great value. Short rib nachos are phenomenal,5
"After waiting for an hour for a table and looking forward to a delicious lunch we were incredibly disappointed.  I don't mind waiting for a table and the service was excellent but the food left a lot to be desired.  I knew the prices going in so I cant complain about that but for the quality of the food the prices were out of line.  My wife ordered a three course meal which consisted of a Cesar salad, beef wellington and desert for $60.  The salad was good but the main course of beef wellington was terrible.  It was cold, super salty and a tiny portion.  The desert was Ok.  I ordered burger and fries for $27.  I ordered the burger medium and what I got was a hockey puck with bacon.  Talk about terrible..fries were fine but come on...$27 for a burger at least cook it right.  Again, the server was very nice and did a great job but next time I want a burger at Caesars Palace Ill go the food court and get burger from one of the fast food places.  My advice, eat somewhere else...",2
Delicious pub grub and fantastic cocktails!,5
"Most amazing experience I have ever had!! Not sure what everyones trip is on here. Please don't listen to them they are clearly crazy, dumb and have no pallet or taste buds. #peoplejustlovetocomplainaboutanything
So, don't listen to these looser on here please! The atmosphere was wonderful. The service was incredible! I felt spoiled! Also, the flavor of my food was fantastic! I don't even like tomatoes and I loved my tomato! The lettuce and tomato was so crisp and fresh. The meat itself was flavored perfectly! The music was perfect too. They bent over backwards for us here. I felt like a celebrity. This was the best birthday dinner ever! My food was hot and prompt!! My drinks were always filled and my server sarah my love, omgsh she was a doll! Best service! ( Coming from a server for 17 years) I loved how they put the napkin in your lap, to the to go containers that are beautiful! I wish this restaurant was in so cal! Thank you for a wonderful experience for my first time. I went in thinking highly of this restaurant because I love Gordan Ramsey. And it was beyond better then I imagined!!!! Me and my family are still talking about it and blown away by it all still! Outstanding!!",5
Had the new york steak with white cheddar cheese potatoes and was delighted with our waiter and the food wss great,5
"Always a pleasure to eat here. Hog Dawg and creme brulee oreo shake pictured, i forget the name of the burger (sorry)",5
"It was a great experience,  Julio our waiter and Cheff Michael made a great job, the Lobster pie pot and the Wellington Fillet were amazing! Dessert was the cherry on Tip! Congrats tp Gordon and Team, it was worth celebrating our  second honeymoon here!",5
"The restaurant was nice and clean and ambiance was great. The server did not put the order in correctly and only checked on us once. The ""bus guy"" was more available to bring us drinks and straws than the server.The burger $21 was dry and fries were not seasoned and the server originally added fries to my bill for $12.99! The menu clearly says $9.99 when purchasing a burger. I do not recommend this place to eat. Gordon Ramsay should add more items to the menu and make adjustments to hire better staff. The hostess was nice.",1
"Had the three course meal, the Caesar salad was underwhelming.  The beef wellington was bland, and the toffee pudding was mostly tasteless other than the vanilla ice cream which was good.  The second star is for the excellent wait service.",2
"Spinach dip was awful . Our entree came out before or app. Burgers were dry and we ordered medium rare ... a whopper has more flavor . Fries we’re dry and not fresh. We still left our severe 20% she was great, this place though ... not so much . First and last visit . Gordon .... get it together",1
Sticky toffee pudding is AMAZING! Great location and the food is great. Staff is awesome as well. Good for a quick bite and drink or sit down meal.,5
Wow you can really taste the oak fire grill!,5
"Service was okay. However when you are paying such high prices you expect outstanding. The water taste like luke warm tap water, ice would have helped. My seat moved around a little as if it wasn't attached properly to the base. My desert was a scoop of ice cream on a somewhat dried cake. It had a fancy name and a high price. There are some really good pubs in Vegas. This one was so so.",3
Good food and atmosphere! No complaints!,5
Was expecting so much more and feel like l was let down probably wouldn't  go back,3
"So, the atmosphere was amazing, and the fish and chips and burgers were delicious. But the most expensive dish... The prime rib was bland and the mashed potatoes were cold. Not terrible but I expected more for $200.",4
"If you're in Vegas & don't visit one of Chef Ramsey's restaurant or pup, then you're missing out! The beef Wellington did not disappoint!! Aaanndddd the dessert was the bomb! Very pleasant atmosphere &  staff was great! I even had an issue with my bill at the end of our dinner, went back the next day to discuss it with the manager, but the one that was on duty the night we were there was off so the assistant manager that was there didn't hesitate to handled my issues & even called me personally to let me know everything was done! Although we didn't get to Chef Ramsey (his wife had their new baby the night before), it was still a fun & memorable night!  (4-5-19)",5
A diverse menu and with an English ambiance,5
Food was good. I was expecting better.,4
"$55 for a chicken escallop (they call it Paillard) and French fries is, to quote Gordon Ramsey “taking the piss”
Throw in a beer and you’re at $80. Have a word!",3
It was pretty good. A bit over priced which makes the food taste a little worse.,3
"It was everything you'd expect it to be and more!!! The artichoke dip was the best I've ever had, the lobster rolls were fabulous and the filet mignon was to die for!! Plus the bar served top notch drinks. Soo amazing!!",5
I ordered the burger and it was the best burger I've ever had. I totally recommend it. For dessert I had the brownie and was not disappointed. Definitely will eat here again.,5
"Gordon Ramsay seriously owns some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas! The truffle fries at this stop are to die for and highly recommended if eating there. There's a nice variety of good food, the prices are reasonable, and service was nice and quick!",5
Not impressed. The best part of this basic bar.... It's openness to the casino floor. Perfect for people watching. We had appetizers and the hell fire wings weren't even spicy. Lamesauce! This photo of the food shows just how impressive this pub was to me.,2
"Amazing food and a little less expensive than Hells Kitchen. They also serve the sticky toffee pudding,  which if you can only get one thing, that should be it.",5
Our dinner was wonderful as always. Only complaint is that the menu suggested that Fuller’s ESB was on tap and I was quite disappointed to learn that it has been out for a while (due to the pandemic) I would suggest an update to the drink menu. We booked this specifically because the Fuller’s beer finder website said this was the only place in Las Vegas that had it on tap. Every other aspect of the experience was wonderful and we will likely return on our next trip (although Hells Kitchen is next on our list to try.),4
"Ordered braised short rib with mashed potatoes & cabbage.  Husband ordered filet minion & mashed potatoes.

The short rib nd mashed potatoes were excellent.  The cabbage was not.  It was a hunk of cabbage.  I was expecting cooked cabbage with some seasoning.

Husband liked the filet minion.

Even for LV and what we got, we thought the food was very expensive, especially since we picked a restaurant listed as $$ on Google.  It's a $$$ restaurant.

After sitting down for awhile, I found the chair uncomfortable enough I stood up and ate (may be a short person problem).

Reduced a star for the cabbage.",4
Worth every single penny omfg. I am salivating just thinking about their food!! Get the sticky toffee pudding! Just do it!,5
Wait staff was great! But did not like the food!,1
"The truffle fries were excellent, the fish & chips were top notch and the shepherds pie was incredibly filling. There were details that were off though: way too much lime in my drink, a pool of oil in the bottom of the fries, our water drinks didn't stay filled even as we were craning our necks looking for our server, chairs had holes in the upholstery, etc. For the price we paid, I expected all of the details to be impeccable.",4
"So I was so excited to eat here,  don't get me wrong the food was good. We had a ceaser salad and the burger and fries. The price tho was crazy... $18 for a salad,  $$36 for the burger. The burger was good but not worth the money.  For both of us almost $100. I know it is a famous place but come on the price is ridiculous.  The waiter we had was no good, did not check on us, fill our water or nothing. I love Gordon Ramsey but lower the price. Mu fries were not fresh either. They were cold and I could tell they had been sitting for a bit..",3
$55 for 12 oz  I thought my stake will have a better quality meat.,1
"Food was amazing, and the peach and ginger lemonade was fantastic too. I would recommend spiking it with vodka, it will make a great drink even better. I had the fish and chips and my fiance had the chicken basket. The chicken basket was a bit oily but overall our food was delicious. Be sure to grab an open seat if you see one because they do run of seats inside and very quickly. Also, even though the they were quite busy when we got there the wait time was very short. Credit to the management and staff for their attention to quality and pace.",5
"Went expecting a good experience at another Gordon Ramsey restaurant. We 6 people tonight. We had a great table bought 2 appetizers and 6 entries. We received an undercooked crispy chicken paillard and also an undercooked grill pub burger. Normally would not be an issue but the server was rude and I don’t feel that the manager resolved the issues. The server was not friendly, again seemed to have an attitude, too busy to refill drinks or check in at the table to see if anything else was needed. We informed the server that the chicken was clearly pink and appeared undercook. We did agree to have the chicken replaced with another entree. The server took the chicken back to the kitchen and did not come back for at least 20 minutes after the replacement meal was delivered. Waiting for server or really any attendant at the restaurant, a host came near our table and say my distressed look as I was trying to get a server’s attention. She was able to get the manager for me. He agreed to take the meal off of the check. We also had a person refilling water at the table constantly and when we asked her for drink refills she said that the server would have to refill drink and that she only did water. I was really looking forward to the Brownie À la mode but since the main course was so underwhelming we  decided against it. Love Gordon Ramsey but will not be returning to the Pub at Caesars.",2
"Solid three star. Really busy so we sat at the bar. Got the jumbo shrimp and deviled eggs. Shrimp was good, had a little white sauce and served fresh and chilled. Eggs looked a little old,
like they sat a bit. The yellow had a slight dull to it.  Asked the bar keep to wash up around us a little soiled, he listened and all was good.",3
"Popped in for happy hour. Service was great, but the food was just alright. I expected the hellfire wings to be the same hellfire wings from Gordon’s burger joint. The pub’s aren’t anything great—they’re mediocre. I wouldn’t pay regular price of $13/6wing. $9/6wing during happy hour is okay. Overall a great happy hour to take advantage of!",3
"Had the tasting menu, the scallops were melt in your mouth amazing. The Wellington was everything I hoped it would be, and the toffee dessert was so great.",5
"Service was good, but fish and chips were not so good. Fries and fish were barely warm. Expected more from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant",2
"Best Lobster Mac and cheese I've ever had by a huge amount. The sliders were amazing too. For the cost, I've also never had more lobster. Huge chunks of deliciousness.",5
"It was O.K. service sucked. After calling in and thinking we have a nice table booked for a bday dinner. NOPE! You get there and front desk treatment was horrible. We had to stand to the side like if it was Denny's . smh expect better service for a $65+ a plate location. Big fan of Gordon Ramsay food was good but not what I expected. Even my wife said ""you have made me better than this"" I will say that corn puree was on point.",3
"Gordon Ramsay has the right to criticize anything and anyone. His restaurants live by his criticism, they give you what's expected. Continue Mr. Gordon you have my approval.",5
Decent food but super over priced.,3
Haven't had a meal this great for awhile and I eat out often.,5
"Food was good, service was good, slightly over prize for what it is but it is to be expected. I got the crispy pork and sear scallop as an entree, it was good food, scallops were definitely Gordon's standard which is browned on both side but not overcooked. But for 42 dollars for 5 scallops I will probably go elsewhere away from the ""pub"" setting",3
"The service was laughably bad . I sat for ten minutes at the bar before I took it upon myself to ask a passing by server for at least a water. They blew me off and pointed at someone else telling me “they will take care of you”. That’s how the night went more or less. Me waiting for at least McDonald’s levels of service and being let down again and again. I ended up getting the short rib and cabbage, and the food was adequate but definitely not exceptional. Drinks were okay. The lobster thingy appetizer was pretty good too. None of it was worth the mediocre service though.",1
"The steak my husband ate was fantastic,but the burger I ate was terrible. I asked for medium, and it came out medium rare. It tasted like they barely used any kind of seasoning on the burger.",4
The menu posted online did not match the menu when we arrived. Everything about the burger was average. The filet mignon was nothing to rave about a year. Had to add a lot of extra salt to season the food.,2
"Came here for my 21st birthday, amazing food and very good customer service . The suprise birthday sticky pudding was an amazing suprise 🥳",5
Not a good place bad customer service was really looking forward for it Came all the way from Texas Are waiter didn’t even offer us drinks just gave us water 😤I really wish Gordon Ramsay could see what kind of people he’s actually having of course the waiter got no tip that was the worst service ever I could even say a Mc Donald’s could have gave me a way better service the food tasted sooo Un seasoned need salt not even worth the price nor the place a well I really wish I could give this place a ZERO STAR 😠,1
"Ramsay burger had over an hour of wait, decided on the pub and was able to indulge in hands down the best burger I've had. A much more laid back vibe and only a few minute wait on a Friday night. GR is the one true king of cuisine",5
"Gordon's 3 Course Lunch
The Beef wellington melts in your mouth.
The truffle fries super yummy.
Sticky toffee pudding is super....
The onion ale soup the really good..
And the best services for scott H.",5
"It was a good dining experience on  Monday.
My fish and chips were quite delicious with 2 big pieces of cod!!! Others had the prime rib and 2 had the braised short ribs. All yummy finished with a delicious butter toffee pudding!",5
Just like what I expected delicious from the first bite to the last. I have been dying to go here and was not disappointed.,5
"Our dinner out at the pub was a highlight of the trip. We came for the Beef Wellington and it didn’t disappoint one bit. The toffee pudding was also amazing. Our waiter, Ali, was very helpful and informative about the courses, and provided excellent service. Thanks for the memories!",5
"I gave 5 stars because of impeccable service! Lobster mac and cheese was very good. Hamburger was decent, but nothing to write home about.",5
"If you want to experience food at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, this is a nice option. Not as famous or pricy as Hell's Kitchen, but very tasty food!",4
"Dinner was amazing, food delicious. I recommend the short ribs 😍",5
Excellent!!! Great food and drinks!,5
"The 3 course is a must, especially with the great service provided by Adam.",5
It’s has really good staff. The flavor in most of the food was amazing. A little expensive but I guess that’s what you expect.,4
"Nothing like my previous experience (in March). I was excited to bring my friends here, and food was so bad they said ""Will is no longer allowed to pick a spot to eat.""",1
"We stopped in while visiting family and had the burger, chicken sandwich and the NY strip steak .... everything was excellent really wanted to try the beef wellington but they couldn't cook it the way I wanted it so was advised not to get it as they will only prepare it his way and extra rare which I don't like hopefully one day I'll be back to try it and get it off the list",5
"Clean, great food (short rib grilled cheese, yummy). Tasty cocktails! Attentive wait staff (I sat at the bar). Will definitely return.",5
"Great service, food was excellently prepared.  A little pricey ($26 for a burger) but this is Vegas and its Gordon Ramsay! The Stickey Toffee Pudding was decadent.",5
Service was superb and the goodbye blue skies cocktail was great. Get the Beef Wellington - one of my new favorite dishes!,5
"Wow I didn’t expect to enjoy this place that much!! Atmosphere is quite chill, large selection of beers and the food was amazing.",4
"Had to leave.  The waiter was without facemask, and when  we asked for a waiter with a mask, he was rude and told it was his option to wear of not,  because  he was vaccinated.  Even people vaccinated has got COVID and also have died.  Its not time to lower safety measures.",3
"The Hellfire Wings, Nachos, & Lobster Rolls were delicious!  Our server was very friendly as well and helpful with his menu and drink suggestions.  Thank you!",5
"Casual, quickly seated, took 15 minutes before a waiter brought water/take our drink order. Waiter had good drink suggestions, lobster mac and lobster rolls were just ok.",3
"Completed the ""Vegas Ramsay Restaurants"". We ordered the fish & chips, and the 3-course lunch meal... caesar salad, petite beef wellington (gotta try the Ramsay wellington at least once in your lifetime) and sticky toffee pudding. Very full but not stuffed.",5
"Perhaps unsurprisingly for a Gordon Ramsey branded restaurant, the food here is pretty great though the service is lacking. The beer menu is excellent with a ton of craft and small breweries available. The decor is a bit odd with a hit you over the head amount of British decor and kegs everywhere. Yes, we get it, it’s a British pub. The food is excellent though, particularly the burgers. The Hell’s Kitchen burger is fiery hot with some ghost pepper but not so much that it overwhelms the palate. The meat is well cooked and seasoned too and didn’t get lost in the heat. Service was mostly non-existent and only showed up for orders and the bill.",4
Server was mediocre.  Spinach artichoke dip was very artichokey and not very cheesy.  Not my personal preference.  Prices are expensive.  Portions are small.  $200 meal.,4
Amazing food plus great service. We had a reservation at 8:15 pm and onve we arrived they immdiatly seated us,5
I had the prime rib it was amazing. I also had a berry lemonade cocktail which was the best damn cocktail I have ever had,5
"The line was long but service was friendly, fast, and efficient.  Serving sizes are HUGE, I definitely could have shared my chicken and chips with my cousin. The toffee brittle is delicious!",4
"The pros: mushy peas: 5 stars. Fish: 4.5, fresh and flaky. Scotch egg: 4 stars. Service: 3-4 stars - super busy at dinner and they could use more servers.  The cons: soggy chips, and when  the website says happy hour 2-5, and the greeters mention happy hour but the bartender at the bar at 4:02 pm says -""no happy hour"", that left a bad taste in my mouth. Overall food was 3.5 to 4 stars, but overall experience was underwhelming.",2
Good food and neat atmosphere. Bone marrow and shrimp cocktail my favorite.,5
Menu was cut in half and hardly anything on there but what they have was amazing,5
Not chef worthy status. Service was slow and the fish anf chips were just diner quality food..nothing compared to the actual British fish and chips. Ramsey call mr I can make better mushy peas,1
"Coming to Vegas, the ONE thing I had to eat was Gordon Ramsay’s beef Wellington. I was very, very disappointed. The portion was TINY, even for the mashed potatoes. The meat was tender, but there was literally NO juiciness to it. It wasn’t the driest meat I’ve ever had, but when you put your fork into it, or pushed down with your fork - NO JUICE. For $60, I expected meat that tasted like it was worth $60. It was pretty much **flavorless**. Mashed potatoes weren’t even good. the service was good though so that is why I give three stars.",3
"Me and my wife we went to get dinner for our civil wedding,  all food and drinks was excellent but the service was on point our server  sladjan was sow nice with us we will come back...",5
"Loved the ambiance, the service is top notch, and the drinks are bomb!",5
"Burger and fries were good...
Nachos too....",4
"Caesar salad lacked any anchovy flavor, wellington and sticky toffee were excellent.",4
"Went to this place didn’t have any expectations because I had travelled in London beginning of this year and didn’t like it there. I was like in Gordon Ramsay’s name how could he make the difference. After the first bite. OMG, it’s really good!!!! The fish, the batter and the food temperature are perfect. I love it. I reordered it right away.  Price is good too. Highly recommended.",5
"There wasn't anything bad about the food but it wasn't anywhere near worthy of the price tag. Dinner starts too late in the day but I guess lunch prices saved my wallet... My Filet was definitely a good cut of meat and very tender, but frankly flavorless, and any little cup of sauce cost another $4. They got some thicc asparagus tho 👀 (for another $13)",2
"I was very disappointed with the restaurant. The scallops were overfried, dry and chewy. The beef was good but the mushroom and coating lacked any favor. The dessert was kind of ok, but hey, a brownie with a scoop of ice cream is not something a famous chef should be proud of.
I was expecting to get something Gordon style, full of passion and ideas, instead I was served in a food factory.",2
"Pretty decent. Isn't one of those places that I'm like ""wow we gotta go back there again"".",4
Nothing special. Average tasting fish and chips. Interesting mashed peas with mint flavor. Service was good.,3
Ordered Lobster roll with fish and chips..,4
Great food and atmosphere even with COVID-19 restrictions in place. Our server was Josh and he was extremely professional and conscientious. When we visit Vegas again we'll definitely stop by for a bite.,5
These are the best fish and chips I have ever had. I especially loved the chips. They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It's great to eat in our take-out.  It is located on the LINQ just off the Las Vegas Strip very near the High Roller.,5
Great food and presentation. Best calamari I’ve ever had. The fish and chips were also great. Upscale pub food.,5
"We stopped in at the pub and grill Las Vegas. Ceasar Palace two days ago, the service was awful and there were knats the size of mosquitos flying around the bar. Because I'm a fan of GR,we decided to come back today. The service was worse. The hostess seated us at the bar, same location at the end. The bar top had not been cleaned. In fact, plates of leftover was still on the table. The big burly bartender, was extremely rude and refused to clean it. After asking two other people,someone finally came and cleaned the space for us. Oh, the nats are still flying. Shame on you Gordon Ramsey! If GR really owns this joint, I'm super dissapointed, and even more so, that his name would be the front for this place. Seriously,,, clean it up!",2
"Enough said I made a reservation 2 days ago understandable Covid 19 ruins everything especially management decision the flavor was horrible staff, ok and my glass stayed empty 1 word what were they thinking opening for reservation with no food food.",1
"Had a bone in my chicken curry. When I let server know she replied it happens since we use fresh chicken off the bone. She didn't even look at the bone. Just replied and walked away. If it wasn't my husband's bday and his much awaited place to visit on our vacation I would have gotten up and left!!! Gave one star cause  the scallops melted in your mouth. Ramsay's show wouldn't allow bones in an entrée! Luckily we made reservations, it was busy. They turned tables over quickly.",1
Wow we waited years to go to vegas it is so worth it to be able to go in 2 days to both his restaurants my daughter loved it we all watch his shows everything love him. The food was absolutely amazing.,5
"Alright. Had the wings which had such a unique sweet and tangy sauce. Little spice kick.

Had the burger which was delicious and the short rib sandwich.... delicious.

Our waitress was amazing. Her name was Daisy  and she deserves the kudos for making the whole experience tie together.",5
"This was our 2nd time here and didn't disappoint! Had the 3 course meal,  beef wellington and was amazing!!",5
The lamb burger was juicy and flavorful. Good service too!,5
Gordon you need to better train the staff. Service was terrible. Food was great. Tumour fish and chips are borinng you need to Take lessons from Noyo Fish Company.,3
"Tried their set lunch menu and they were sooo good. Loved all of them!! Staffs were friendly, I know its not many on the menu due to pandemic but it was so difficult to make a reservation but luckily we found a spot for us for july 4th lunch!",5
"Chicken wings were good the truffle spinach artichoke dip was so so. If you like truffle flavor look elsewhere, not even sure why they call it truffle spinach artichoke. It's the new Vegas so drinks were pricey and the food was just so so.",4
The bartender Dave treated me and my daughter absolutely terrible tonight. We patiently waited for a burger and nachos for over an hour. I inquired about the food twice but was really in no rush because I was enjoying the conversation with my daughter.  The 3rd time I asked he became frustrated as if I had did something wrong. I politely asked to cash Out on our drinks. Immediately after doing so the food arrived. Dave rudely ordered the waiter to go away saying we refused our meal instead of providing customer service. The treatment was absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary. Never again.,1
Presentation was beautiful /No flavor,3
Always a great experience.,5
"Very good Berger's. Fast friendly, wish I could have met gordan.",5
"For someone who is consistently critical of other chefs, Gordon needs to look closer to home.  The worst meal of my life even though it was a simple British classic fish and chips.

The fish was ruined and the chips were drenched in oil and obviously I paid a premium being at Caesars Palace.",1
Not impressed with the beef wellington soggy and undercooked..cold inside,2
Great food and service the food was high but we ate for free.,5
Ok but not spectacular. Way over priced for this level of food. Underwhelming at best.,4
"Best burger ive had no doubt, amazing Trouffle fries!!! And the desert was phenomenal! Thanks so much!",5
Nice fish and chip ! The chicken is nice too.,3
"Amazing interior and atmosphere, flawless service and delicious food. Worth every dollar it costs. If I ever come back to Las Vegas, will definitely visit this place again!",5
"Cool place, great service, good food.",4
A little pricey but very good,5
"Delicious, go for Happy hour and try a variety!  Service is spectacular!",5
Did not have Shepard's Pie on the lunch menu anymore. Also they dropped Innis and Gunn beer. (Gordon Ramsey's favorite). Prices increased dramatically since last year.,4
Burger was dry. Was horrible honestly. 👎👎,1
Delicious,5
"Service was great. Atmosphere great.
Food was aiight.
I believe Gordon Ramsey would be ashamed if he knew what they were passing off as fish and chips. Hopefully they were just having an off day.
Lobster roll was great!",3
Got horrible food poisoning from this restaurant. Highly expensive and the food was BASIC (like Gordon you should be ashamed),1
"Food was great, but the other restaurant.the staff was very ignorant wasn't helpful",5
My boyfriend and I ate here over the weekend! Michael was our server and he was very on point with everything. Thank you for the amazing customer service. I have to say the food was delicious! Tho a little on the pricey side it was amazing and well worth it. The only reason I am giving this review a 4 star is due to the short hostess at the front who was rude and doesn’t even talk if you ask her a question. You should have someone more friendly greeting your customers. Aside from that our experience would have been perfect. We will definitely be back.,4
"Soooo good!
I loved the Belgium margarita
And the Beef Wellington
Worth the money. True story tho... I thought I ordered the whole roast..... it was two slices
...

......
......
I'm a hungry girl",5
"tl;dr Overall the pub is a decent place to grab a bite. It has a pleasant aesthetic, attentive staff, and delicious entrees.

I arrived right at 11:00am and there was a small line waiting for service, everyone was seated promptly and I was provided a choice of seating preference given the restaurant was not very busy yet. The hostess was polite but not friendly.

The waitress of my section was attentive and arrived with my drink order, a vodka soda, soon after ordering it. When she returned she asked if I knew what I wanted to eat, I advised her that I was having trouble deciding and she smiled and walked away (I would have preferred suggestions, but oh well). After a few minutes I placed the menu on the table and she returned to me almost immediately. I ordered pub burger appetizer and the Shepard’s pie. The burgers arrived within 5 minutes. Cooked to medium as requested, the bottom bun was fairly cold in contrast to the warm buttery top. The burgers were flavorful yet somehow dry. The Shepard’s pie arrived 9 minutes after the appetizer. The pie was made to perfection, topped with golden potatoes and a creamy rich center. I ended up making it through about 2/3rds of my pie before I became too full to continue. My entree was certainly worth the price. Overall the pub is a decent place to grab a bite. It has a pleasant aesthetic, attentive staff, and delicious entrees.",4
"Nice food I like the steak very delicious but a little expensive, didn't have to wait long to be seated and eat. worth the visit",5
The fish with the fish chips was delicious. The chips were cold and soggy. The mushy peas with mint was in horrible need of salt. The burger ordered was dry and disappointing. Over priced and over hyped.,3
The bread pudding was outstanding. The beef wellington was also excellent.,5
Great food! Lovely service! Fish and Chips!! Lobster Roll the BOMB! My first visit to Vegas in 18 months.,5
Not very good. $30 for a fried chicken sandwich that was worse than chic fil a. Bread was dry and chicken was kinda soggy.,2
"If you want to know how heaven feels like you just need to try this amazing signature dessert from Gordon Ramsey.
This toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream is to die for. It is the best dessert I have ever had in my whole entire life.
Do you want a tip? If the restaurant is full (normally is packed) you can always go straight to the bar and order food and drink at it. The the service is great.
There are few TV's in this restaurant if you are interested into sports.
You must try this dessert... You will thank me later",5
"Had the Spinach dip for starters.....the cheese was just melted leaving the Spinach Dip just  barely warm for the delicious chips that was paired with it, . Main course was fish and chips this dinner entre was disappointing not only the fish was frozen at one time prior to cooking (mushy fish not flaky as a fresh Cod should be). The batter had a distinctive  taste of fresh cooking oil. Not only was this a flaw mushy Cod with greasy thick batter but we also received greasy steak fries. Thank you for the Gordon Ramsey Pub experience  we will be not be coming back.",3
"Amazing food! The onion soup, beef wellington and the sticky toffee pudding were so amazing. 10/10 would recommend!",5
"My boyfriend and I had our last dinner in Vegas here at the pub and grill on 4/13/21. We had reservations and were seated even though we showed up a bit early. The service ok, nothing above being at standard everyday restaurant. My boyfriend got the burger and I got the fish and chips with the onion soup to start. The soup was good but I prefer the traditional French onion over this rendition. After we finished, we headed out to play a few more slots. About 45 minutes later I was getting a pretty bad stomach ache. Long story short, I spent the last night of our vacation in the bathroom with food poisoning. I had a 4 hour drive home yesterday being sick and still sick today.",1
"Tried every appetizer and they were all excellent.  Fun casual place to get good food at ""reasonable Vegas"" prices.",4
3.5 stars. Nice ambiance and burgers. Very average butter chicken curry.,3
"An awesome experience!! The food was beyond wonderful! You definitely need to get the Short Rib Kettle Chip Nachos! Our server, Scott was the best! Very personable, knowledgeable and most of all honest. Steered to to the best dishes and menu recommendations. A full 5 star experience from the back of the house to the front.",5
"Where do I begin without giving too much away. . . .
1. If you ask for a recommendation like I did, you will not regret it.
2. You WILL be satisfied with your meal!
3. This is not a fast food restaurants, so if you have plans of exploring Vegas, make sure you do it before coming here.
4. This is a relaxing/calm setting.
So, if you are planning to hit a club, your mood might change after eating here.

Luckily, we did not wait more than one minute before we were seated.",5
"This place is a sad joke. You'll pay 40 bucks for a burger, wait 40 minutes for it, and then finally leave the place still hungry.",2
Fish and chips were good. Fish is fresh and was crispy.,3
Wouldn't waste your time or money. Food was nothing special. So you're paying for is the name. Do yourself a favor and eat at the food court before you eat here,3
Excellent. This place is amazing,5
"The kettle cooked nachos were quite tasty (the only reason this is getting 3⭐ instead of 2. The chicken sandwich was bland. Drinks along with all of the food items are ridiculously overpriced for what they are. The presentations are unimaginative and there is a complete lack of any kind of ambiance.

Gordon Ramsay should scream at himself for a change for putting his name on this place.",3
"I was super excited to visit this location and had high expectations, however it turned out to just be okay and pretty overpriced. I ordered the NY strip cooked medium with mashed potatoes. Unfortunately the streak was well done and a bit charred and the potatoes tasted like mashed potato flakes. My date ordered the beef Wellington and said it tasted amazing. We shared the dessert and that was the highlight of the meal. It was to die for!
Not sure the food was worth the spendy bill though. Quality and portion size didn’t match the price.",3
My sandwich was cold..what would Gordon say,3
Can’t say anything bad about it. The fish batter is perfect. It’s the most proper fish and chip shop that I’ve found in the USA so far.,5
"Best burger! Our server Sladjan was the best!!!
We will come here every time we’re in LV. Chef Ramsey has a great staff and the best server we ever experienced. The Old Fashion I ordered was one of the best I’ve ever had. #oldfashionfav
#dontlistentosharonburtondownbelow",5
Great customer service good food,5
The wings where soooo good,5
Food was incredible of course. Massive fan of gordon ramsay and his food. Always comes out perfect and tastes better than any other meal ever eaten. However it was disappointing that you couldnt change anything with the meal which has never happened at any other restaurant of his. My grandmother eats strictly and did not want the avocado or vegan mayo on her veggie burger. We were told they couldnt make it without the options so she had to remove it herself.,4
"Beautiful decor, friendly staff. My husband enjoyed his food but mine was horrible. You would think their signature fish and chips would be good, Gordon Ramsey should try it and see what they try to pass off as food- do NOT order the fish and chips!!",1
It was good. My husband always wanted to try beef wellington.  He loved it.,4
"Delicious beautifully crafted food! Due to the pandemic, vegan options are limited but possible! Our server was beneficial in this arena, ""going raw is your best bet"". Wonderful memories and a one of a kind experience! We will be dreaming of this food and we will be back!",5
I love this place! Amazing food and really great service. You have to try the wings and truffle fries - YUM!,5
"Everything I expected! Great atmosphere, fantastic service and then there's the food!",5
"I really enjoyed eating here, it did not disappoint. The food was delicious and customer service was amazing. It is a very welcoming place.",5
Excellent service very attentive staff best calamari ever,5
Great food...great service.... But didn't care so much for the dine in set up...kinda noisy but I'd go back!,4
Totally love this restaurant. Casual but very good food.   Worth the money!,5
"Came for the name and wasn't disappointed. We were looking for a quick bite, nothing complicated and that's just what we got. Simple menu, fast, fresh and tasty.",5
This was my second time eating here and the first time was amazing so I was expecting nothing less. However I unfortunately discovered my fish and chips were over battered and was partially raw inside. After only few bites but it didn't matter because I spent the evening I'll. My boyfriend ordered prime rib and it was overcooked. Very disappointing experience. At least the management agreed and took our plates away and did not make us pay.,1
"The food exceeded expectations. Our waiter had a few takes on what's popular and his favorite dish, but said overall you can't go wrong with what you order. Our table ordered the nacho app and I had the Curry dish. It was easily one of the best places I've had Indian food. The naan was perfect and the sauce was creamy and rich but not in the I'm gonna be sick after I eat this way. I highly recommend grabbing food here. As with all places in Vegas it's overpriced but at least you know you're getting good food.",5
Best beef Wellington ever. Can't wait to recreate this.,5
Great service. Onion soup was spectacular. So was the sticky toffee pudding. Wellington was pretty good but not great.,4
The food was okay. Same Ole bar food.,4
Awesome food and service.,5
I had  the pub burger it was so good I would definitely come back.,5
26.99 for burgers and fries. Medium wel burger was charred to hell. We spend on food that is good but this was definitely not worth it.,2
Had a scotch egg excellent as well as steak and ale pie and shepherds pie really nicely done,5
"Food was delicious!! Great service, fast and friendly.",5
Great service n food can't wait to go back,5
I got sick. But the staff was good,1
The setting was laid back yet upscale. Service was good & the lobster rolls were great!,4
"My kids love Gordon Ramsays show so they insisted wife n i eat there. We chose the Casears palace locatiin and were pleasantly surprised. We had a couple of cocktails which were both great, plus a couple of appetizers including a 6 oz wagyu steak to share. I had to try the wagyu even tho i was not hungry. Simply so i can critique it just fir my readers! As u may know, i was bummed out at Jean Georges for their same grade A5 wagyu thenight b4. Having seen the same grade and 6 oz offering fir 1/2 the price ($59 vs $120), it was a no brainer to test out. I did warn the server id be reviewing it here with photo so hope he didnt bias the chef. The steak was orderd med rare and was cooked properly. Flavor wise it was tops. Sadly, it was NOT the same as Birch Steskhouse back home in MN meaning when you cut into it, the marbling and juices were evident and flowing fir ur eyes to see. If u do not know what i mean, better do a youtube search for grade A5 wagyu b4 ordering. Hence, the meat resembled a filet mignon that youd see at other fine steak houses. Wagyu? Well, it just didnt look it nor tasted like it. My best grade 5 wagyu exp as listed above from Birch steskhouse looks just like on youtube searches AND melts in ur mouth like cotton candy. SO, for 59.00 i said to myself,nice try. Id never order it again. Justnot a fan of not getting what i paid for. Service was great tho and prices reasonable considering its Vegas Baby!",4
The most amazing Beef Wellington in the 50 states,5
The food is amazing. It is to be expected in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.,5
"We really enjoyed this place. Beef Wellington was excellent as usual. Fish and Chips were very good. Also, we ordered a side of macaroni. It was really good, but maybe not as good as the one we ate at Hells Kitchen. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars was because our Calamari was a little over salted and the breading was too dark. Not inedible but just not perfect. Also at 22 a beer maybe beer is too pricey. Service was excellent. We probably would come back.",4
"I can’t understand why Gordon Ramsey would have his name associated with this establishment. A group of seven of us had dinner here on a not particularly busy night. After having been seated at one of the high tables it took us 30 minutes to order drinks and another 20 minutes to get them. We had a variety of starters and mains, but none were really satisfied with what they were served. The “medium rare” steak was grey throughout (went back), the burgers were bland and dry, and the prime rib was as close to a shoe sole I’ve ever had. The deviled eggs had clearly been sitting in a fridge for quite some time, dry and ice cold (and also I wonder where the devil was, as they had no sting whatsoever).

Bearing the name of celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey I think this place detracts from his value rather than adds to it. Not recommended, and very disappointing.",1
"Awesome place and good prices for a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Got the soft shell crab sandwich. I love soft shell crab but had never seen it on a sandwich before, it was excellent. Also had corned beef poutine which was great. The brussel sprouts had a sweet glaze and bacon bits, also excellent. Overall I would definitely recommend this place!",5
"After months of dreaming about being here we were not dissapointed when we were seated for our previously reserved dinner . The atmosphere was lively and people seemed to be having a great time. Hubby ordered the Beef Wellington and I ( being a Brit and not having had any in 18 years since i emigrated ), ordered Fish and Chips. Well...The Beef Welly   in the words of my husband  was "" Ahh mazing"".- it was devoured very quickly let me tell you...as for my Fish and Chips, well they didn't dissapoint except- yes i was a little sad - the fries were soggy !!! I was expecting perfection and almost had it ...ugh. The fish was crispy on the outside , flaky on the inside ..just divine .
Now as for dessert....it had to be Sticky Toffee Pudding...it was my birthday and i believe when i made the reservation i left that in the notes...i had forgotten all about it , so when i asked for the dessert to go i was touched when our server was sweet enough to add a candle for me to blow out and make a wish. A nice touch...as for the pudding.....be still my taste buds. I kept that little gem for a bedtime snack and it was pure perfection.
Even though the fries were soggy i still gave this place 5* ..it's so worth it ...Go , you won't be sorry.",5
"Inside Caesars Palace Casino, near the food court.  Good food and fairly easy to get into without a reservation.",4
Went there at 7:30 p.m. on September 28th ordered prime rib extra rare and it came out so far overdone it wasn't even funny it was beyond well done it took 40 minutes to get it to our table they offered to get me another one and I did not want to wait another 40 minutes all the rest of the food was mediocre I will never eat a Gordon Ramsay's again someone should teach his chefs how to cook I do better prime rib than that.,2
Only fancy. This might be the level of Gordon Ramsay. Media makes star. They don't care about the temperature of food. Shake taste like melted ice cream.,1
Great fish and chips!,5
"After watching Gordon Ramsey for years we had to try his restaurant.  I ordered the fish and chips and was able to substitute the chips with truffle fries for a few dollars more.  The fish was amazing.  With it came mushy peas.   I didn't expect it to taste that good.  Overall our meal was delicious.  Sadly,  our waiter wasn't attentive at all.  We gave up trying to order more drinks because he was no where to be found during our meal.",4
"Beef Wellington was great, staff was super nice.",5
Fish and chips elevated. Perfectly fried flaky cod. The sauces are also amazing; I tried the curry and tartar sauce and was not disappointed! Like moves quickly even if it looks busy so no waiting like other Ramsay restaurants.,5
"Overpriced, noisy and my lamb shepherds pie was not good at all. It was tasteless and soggy. Disappointed with the place. Waitress came 2 times to our table with wrong food, she was not sure about table numbers. I guess management should dedicate more time to train their people better.",2
"Nice selection of beverages for sure. Food, average",3
Those truffle fries and the white cheddar mashed potatoes were AMAZING!! Mouth still waters every time I think about them!,5
The experience was pretty good but not what I'd call high end...as the prices would suggest. A lot of gristle on my New York Steak but the drinks at the bar were excellent.,4
Amazing food and awesome customer service,5
Food was amazing will be returning for sure,5
"Seriously one of the best meals of our life. Sarah was absolutely fantastic, she brought extra dip without being asked and was just ahead of everything we could have wished for the whole meal! Amazing!",5
Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. The fish and chips looked great. I add the chives and cheese to the French fries which did not taste that good. After I ate the srimôp,3
"Great food. Prices are high, but you are paying for the Gordon Ramsey name and Las Vegas.  You should expect to pay for this kinda thing.  Food was excellent.  Took a bit to get a server but after that food came out quickly.  The server was definitely busy, but when he was with us he cared about us.  The braised short rib was awesome.  Out of this world (looking at you demiglaze). GF got the salmon.  Was good but kinda plain.  Was cooked correctly and was good quality, but felt like it needed a sauce/seasoning to kick it up to the next level.  Normally don't get dessert either but we got the sticky toffee pudding and it was awesome. Overall the value is there if you see 2-3 things you like on the menu and are willing to pay a premium for the Ramsey name.",5
Food was delicious everything we ordered from our appetizer spinach and artichoke to our steak dinner,5
Good ambience. Amazing food.,5
"Good food, the service was amazing. The lady serving us really went above and beyond.",5
Overpriced and tasteless food,1
Had the chicken sandwich.  Nice!,5
"Ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich. No sauce, no spice, mainly fried flour and barely any chicken.",2
The fish and chips was the BEST i've ever had. not to mention it comes with amazing sauces. Upgrade to the truffle fries. You wont regret it. The Wedge salad was also one of the best.,5
Good service... pricey...food 3 out of 5... sports bar experience... no shouting in the kitchen...:-),3
Wooow the beef Wellington was amazing also the fish and chips... omg the dessert.. nonetheless the Caesar salad was incredible. Everything was incredible,5
Good food great service fantastic staff.,5
The steak was $55 for me and my wife on our pre anniversary I’ve had better steak,2
Great food. The Wellington is delicious.,5
"So disappointing!
Our waiter seemed annoyed at his job.  Then he and another waiter stood at the wait station next to us and badmouthed the staff!
I had never seen asparagus so big.  As a farmer I can't imagine selling those at market.
My husband could not find a single piece of lobster in his lobster pie.
We were so excited for this and all I can say is meh to the food and 2 thumbs down to the service!!!!",2
"Delicious food, nice ambience and very friendly service. They brought us a free cake for our anniversary!  The accommodations for covid were done in a way that was not inconvenient so we hardly noticed. Recommended.",5
"wonderful, just wonderful. i had ordered some foot and asked for it to be delivered to my room in Caesars palace, and i wasn’t knowing what to expect. i settled on the burger with fries. it was just amazing. very fast delivery and high quality food, i’d recommend to anyone staying at Caesers palace or visiting Vegas in general. :)",5
"I have been to the restaurant  And  Hell's kitchen both are way better. Two big guys at a.small round  cocktail table doesn't cut it especially when the wait staff are slow to remove the empty plates. And the special sauce that came with my partners beef wellington was all wrong. He had to send it back and get something else. He has had it many times before and they assured him it was the same, but it wasn't even close. My short ribs were great so as far as that, I was pleased with the food. But I would avoid the pub and grill if your used to Gordon Ramsay's better restaurants. Now I'm afraid to go to the fish and chips one.",3
Good gourmet food but portions quite small. We went in out of curiosity to see what Ramsay brand is about? I enjoyed it. It's like being in a good old pub eating burgers and chips except it's Gordon's burger and chips. Good place for a quick bite.,4
We got to see Gordon in person! Great food!,5
"Prices are expensive, food was ok for this famous person Gordon Ramsey. This restaurant in particular was ok, I've had way better (portion size & flavorful food) in places much cheaper price wise. I think it was not worth it too much, but you have to try for urself to see if it worth it right, I wouldn't come back here. Every person's opinion does help though.",4
Great food. Great service. Had lunch here and did not disappoint. Great atmosphere.,5
Tasting menu was amazing. Just the right portions.,5
Good food as expected,5
Food was amazing and the service was great. Will definitely be returning next time im in town,5
"I like this place a lot, I usually visit his steak house when I am in Vegas. But I just found out that he has a couple dishes in both restaurants -  and at Pub&Grill they are cheaper!

The only thing which disappointed me quite a lot actuallly, he has no Scotch Egg on the menu.  Other than that, a very good place to eat.",5
"Despite the name, the setting is very laid back and comfortable. The dishes are elevated comfort foods and that is not a knock. The beer list is extensive and the quantities incredible (35 oz beer that kept me sipping all night).

The staff is attentive, fast, and courteous. I would definitely come back here, especially for the juicy lamb burger.",4
"If you are looking for authentic British fish and chips, go no further, it was bland just like most typical British Cuisine. I have had more flavor in fish and chips from an Applebee’s then this place. Will not recommend it to anyone. Overpriced as well. Only thing keeping it down was the lemon wedge and the Angry Orchard cider I had to drink after every bit  to keep it down. If there fish and chips was this messed up, I’m glad I didn’t opt to dish out the $50 for their steak.",1
"We decided to get take out and was pretty disappointing. I have dined here before, so this was my first time getting take out here. Not good. We have gotten take out inside Caesars like Raos and it was excellent and food was nice and hot. Not here....

PROS
-burger was okay

CONS
-the shrimp cocktail was sad and pathetic. They basically just threw the mediocre tasting shrimps into a box. They forgot to include this order in my take out, but we already walked back to our Caesars room, so I tried calling them but someone kept hanging up on us!
-cold soggy fries
-no one picks up the phone at this location. We kept calling and they would hang up on us.

Make sure you check your order like I should have!!",2
"Busy and loud, but that's what a pub should be, right? Good food, decent service. The prices weren't too bad for a """"name"" restaurant on the strip.",4
Great Beef Wellington!,5
"Usually we had great experiences here but thanks to COVID that all changed. It was around 9pm and we were trying to find a nice restaurant to eat at. We narrowed our choices to this place and an Italian restaurant, keep in mind there wasn’t enough time to go to the other place if Ramsay’s didn’t work out. I saw the menu and felt like eating their burger. We got put on a waiting list for 25mins and the waiter took his time getting to us once we were sat. Then he tells us they’re only serving the “diner menu”... this was a huge letdown because the burger was on the lunch menu and the diner menu was not impressive at all, it was just full of overpriced steaks and generic dishes Gordon Ramsay isn’t really known for. His signature dishes like the Beef Whelington was not on there when it usually is, it was at Hell’s Kitchen but they wouldn’t seat us without a reservation and they were all booked up. So we asked the waiter if there was anyway we could still order the burger...I mean how hard is it to grill a burger? But he said no...had he said yes I’d have given them 5-stars. Once again the diner menu was full of things I could get at any steakhouse. Unimpressed we left. Since they killed our time we were unable to find a nice restaurant this late and had to settle for fast food. I’d say they failed to live up to Gordon Ramsay’s own high standards. If they can still grill a steak they should have easily been able to grill a burger.",1
"It was delicious and the staff were very kind. A bit expensive for what you got, but a fun experience.",4
"Service was great and the food was also great. Looking forward to trying other GR restaurants. I had the ""Salted Beef"" Poutine and Airline Chicken",5
Increíble food and service ...,5
"Located in Ceasars palace in the way back area. Took us a minute to find it but it was worth the search. Service was excellent, we had a very nice waitor and host. I ordered the beef wellington and someone else ordered the shepards pie and bacon burger. Beef Wellington was delicious, I've never tried anything like it before. Very good cut of steak meat surrounded with mushroom paste with croissant like breading on the outside with a side of mashed potatoes and veggies. The shepards pie was hands down the best I've ever tried. Whatever cheese they used was genius, creamy pot of savory comfort food. Moderately priced for about an average of $25-$57 plates. The Beef Wellington is the most expensive at $57 per plate and I say moderate because pretty much everything is expensive in Vegas and I don't travel to eat fast food the whole time. If I return to Vegas def going back here.",5
Super service. Daisy was an awesome server!,5
"Amazing place to eat. I had the lobster shrimp roll appetizer it was hands down best I ever had. I had the fish and chips...light batter very soft inside amazing. My gf had the short rib with mash potatoes, cabbage..everything was melt in your mouth delicious. I will definitely be back. It is pricey but worth it.",5
Great food and service!  You cant go wrong here!,5
I went with my mom it was nice. It had great food it was delicious I highly recommend getting shepherds pie or a beef wellington. I highly recommend you tying this place out if your in Vegas and have the chance. Have a wonderful blessed day.,5
"Amazing. Customer service was amazing, food was amazing, atmosphere was amazing. Just amazing!",5
The burger was fantastic!,5
The food here was really amazing. I had the beef Wellington and my wife had the stew. We shared the sticky pudding for desert. I loved the food and the options on the menu.,5
The flavors were off the charts!  Service was exceptional.  We'll be going back!,5
"Good fish and chips.  A single order is good to split between two people for a nice substantial snack.  Fish is extremely fresh and the batter is quite good.  The mango curry sauce is a standout.  Lack of chippy staples like mushy peas was a drag, but I guess mushy peas wouldn't fly that well in Vegas anyway unless you could make it into a stick and deep-fry it.  Would be nice to be able to get a cup of tea here as not much goes better with a midday fish and chips than a good strong brew.",4
"This place is grossly overpriced and the food is bland. Gordon tell your people to salt their food, you Id!ot sandwich. Do not waste your money or time here. The French onion soup made us sick",1
I mean even the ketchup was fantastic,5
"Food is good, but not worth the price.

To be fair, everything on The Strip in 2021 is so expensive now. My burger with fries was $27... good, but not $27 good.",3
Excellent service and the food was amazing! The cocktails set the stage for an awesome lunch of lobster and shrimp rolls with truffle fries.  Will be back!,5
The best burgers in town.,5
Had a reservation booked for months. 30 minutes before our reservation time they canceled because they were overbooked…right after we already got a taxi and walked there. Huge fans of Gordon Ramsey and we were really looking forward to this dinner as it was my husband and I’s first anniversary celebration. Very disappointed.,1
Short rib grilled cheese. Excellently executed.,5
Great service and great food!!,5
Great and tasty food! One of the best style of nachos ever!,5
Tried to go and for the second time it's closed over an hour before it's listed closed and with people inside. I'm not trying for three,1
"Our meals were delicious. Although you'd expect to pay a higher price at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant inside of Caesars, the high cost of the meal is the only reason I can't rate it five stars.",4
"Soggy food, overly oily, and the ""hellfire wings"" were woefully under-cooked and the entire place has gone from fantastic 3yrs ago to passable now.",2
"Some food was overly salty, and waiter wasn't very consistent. Also the check was supposed to be split, but waiter swiped the same card twice. Other than those inconveniences, it was a fun experience.",4
The kettle nachos were great!,5
"This place is really good, for pub food at least. I was maybe expecting a little more based on the name and the price. For the 2 of us it was approx $100, which is fair for Gordon Ramsay, but a lot for pub food. We ordered an appetizer to share, a main each and a dessert, no drinks (even though it’s Vegas).

The appetizer we ordered was really delicious, it was the Kettle Chips nachos which was a cool twist on traditional nachos and it was delightful! A little expensive at $17, because we saw that for happy hour it dips down to about $7, but oh well, it was worth it.

The mains we ordered were a Shepherds Pie and a Beef Pot Pie, both were pretty good, we were honestly so full from the nachos that we barely ate our mains but they just probably weren’t as good as what we were expecting to eat it there and then. We ended up taking them home and eating them as leftovers which was fine. But at close to $30 per, they just didn’t seem worth it.

The dessert is a must! I believe it was Gordon Ramsay’s famous Toffee Pudding, which we shared and it was amazing. I would say the best part of the dinner, and we almost skipped it because of how full we were. It’s a must! Doesn’t matter how full or how much it adds to you bill in terms of cost, you have to try this. I’m not a fan of toffee but I’m thinking twice after having it, I enjoyed it so much.

Our server was very nice, the decor and the atmosphere is also not bad. A little expensive for what it is, but you’re paying for the name. If you can come here for happy hour and order the nachos and the dessert you’re all set for a nice meal and cheap prices!",4
Just the Best Nice and friendly people here. Delicioso food!,5
"I honestly expected better but due to shut downs,  most restaurants were shut down, so we didn't have much chose.  Everything super expensive for what the portion size was.  Staff was gracious and courteous.",3
You can taste Ramsey's perpetual disappointment cooked into the tender meat. Clearly it makes a difference.,5
Pricey but delicious and great quality.,4
"Great burgers, friendly staff, comfortable COVID measures in place.",5
I was extremely happy with our service and food quality.  I have dined at most of Gordan Ramsey's restaurants in Las Vegas and was not surprised that the pub and grill was phenomenal.  I actually had better service and food than in the other restaurants.  The caesar salad was excellent and the spinach artichoke chips were so soft and flavorful.  We ordered the burger and it was beyond great.  Thank you for the experience!,5
The mashed potatoes were tasty. My husband loved the burger,5
"Food was just ok. Expected more. Wife got the fish and chips since that is what they are known for, and she said they were just ok. Nothing special. On the plus side, service was really good and our waiter was great.",3
"Went for vacation and main reason was to try a Gordon Ramsay dining experience, and gotta say, I'll never forget my experience. Absolutely fantastic food and service. Wish I could eat there every day the rest of my life.",5
"Received outstanding service today from Yaneisy. The Fish n chips were superb, Spinach Dip was full of flavor and the Belgium Margarita's were the Bomb very strong.",5
"The food was fantastic, and the British rock music playing was a nice touch.",5
"Worst fish and chips I've ever had. Bland, no flavor. Artichoke dip appetizer was delicious.",2
I have to say the waitress was super nice. For the food overpriced for what you get just because its gordons kitchen. You can get the same menu down the street and half the price. Feel like for that price gordon should be cooking for us not one of his minions.,3
Delicious nachos different but good.,5
Best lamb burger ever.  Try it and see for yourself.,5
It's RAW! Haha this was a great experience and if you're a Gordo Ram fan I would recommend. The burger was tasty and the fish and chips were amazing. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable.,5
Food and environment was awesome loved the pea puree with the fish and chips. And our waitress Yaneisy was even better.,5
I wonder if the reviews were bought cause this place doesn’t hold up to your expectations. I would rather go to other place for dinner than spend 30$ on a extremely salty chicken paillard and 39$ poor fish and chips.  Extremely disappointing place.,1
"Amazingly fresh and delicious food! Truffle fries, beef wellington and lobster rolls were incredible.",5
"Great food, friendly staff, tasty drinks!",5
Exactly what you'd expect from a Gordan Restaurant. To die for!!!,5
Really Good Food.. Burger is a must,5
"We had the beef wellington, short rib nachos and prime rib... Sooooo freaking delicious and worth the money.",5
"Honestly the reason I took off a star is because the Beef Wellington wasn't as good as it is at Hell's Kitchen, and it was the same price. As a GR restaurant, I had higher expectations.

Staff didn't seem too friendly either. Maybe our server just had a bad day.

The braised short rib was great though (see photo).",4
Thinking Gordon Ramsey’s had such high hopes of the best prime rib I had ever had!! The exact opposite the beef tasted very bland very flavorless! The horseradish sauce was mostly sour cream! And the Yorkshire pudding was burnt. The food looked great until we took first bite!,1
"Fantastic, lobster rolls were crazy good",5
Incredible. Amazing New York steak. Incredible food and even better service. Elise best waitress/hostess one could ask for. 5 star service.,5
My wife and i ate here i tried her lobster tail she ordered. That night were both throwing up for a while. Possible food poisoning.,1
Beef Wellington was over cooked and dry. The guy next to me ordered the same and his was very juicy. We waited for years to get a Wellington and I am unimpressed. Sorry G.R.,3
Excellent service and hands down tastey shepherd pie! Can't wait to explore the menu more. 🍽,5
"Tried to send back my sons undercooked burger and the waiter whined that they’re have to cook a whole new burger...COVID rules...uh, never mind? Generic, overpriced fast food rebranded as celebrity chef pub food. Don’t settle - you will be disappointed.",1
Not worth the hype,3
"Terrible service. Ignored at a bar with 4 other people. Bartender was useless and extremely unfriendly. She seemed to want to talk to one couple the whole time, beyond check on me for anything. Had no chance to order entree after my lukewarm onion soup came. Extremely disappointing",1
Good food. But menu very limited. Need more variety for a pub.,4
Good food prices are high but this is Vegas it's the experience your paying for.,4
Good burguers.   But expected more,4
"Excellent food, excellent beer, excellent service. Hard to ask for more.",5
Gluten free brownie with salted peanut ice cream by chef Elizabeth Stolarick is amazing!,5
"Great food, service was amazing.",5
"For the price it's 3 stars, if it the 3 course meal was 80 dollars it would be 5 stars. But it was 136 dollars with tax. The chicken was a bit dry, the lobster was nice and moist with good seasonings, the scallops were a little plain with good texture, the salad was good the toffee dessert was ok but a little plain. The avocado dip was terrific, best part of the meal. Bone marrow was good, nice and moist shredded beef. Wellington was ok risotto was good",3
Everything was good expect the rise was a bit dry,3
Great experience. Had the lobster roll and bacon Mac n cheese. Both were great.,5
My wife and I are huge Gordon Ramsay fans and have wanted to eat at one of his places for a long time. The wine available here is absolutely amazing; the muscato we got was one of the best I have ever had. The wellington and fish and chips were very good and our server was excellent.,5
Good food 😋,5
This place was hard to find but the food was great. It's a little pricey but the service is fast.,5
"I had the New York strip steak, medium rare and the asparagus. It was great and cooked to perfection.",3
"Great fast service, great food and drinks. reasonable prices.",5
"Wonderful food, good service which you of course pay plenty for but really don't need the deafening music. THAT
made it more difficult to enjoy the great food and drink and is definitely damaging the hearing of the employees.",4
Great steak. Great drinks. 👍amazing vibe and feel,5
"The service was horrible, the facility needs tons of work. We were having a company get together and ordered everything off the menu, most items were cold or lacked taste.",1
The waiter was very attentive but food was ok. Hells kitchen food/chef was far suoerior!,3
"I know we are in trying times, but this is the time to be customer centric. the hostess was great and friendly, Our server seemed disinterested and indifferent, our water was left empty a few times.
The steak was well cooked and the mashed potatoes were delicious, the hamburger was also very delicious as were the rosemary fries.",4
"Went in for lunch it was wonderful, girlfriend loved the beef Wellington",5
"As always was an excellent experience. Great service, Great food, is there anything else that needs to be said?",5
"We chose this place as a compromise between experience/quality and exorbitant prices that seemed to be a hallmark of Vegas. The food was great, portions large, and service high quality. Drinks were expensive at $15+ and the meal easily climbed over $100 even ordering some of the least expensive items on the menu. However still a good experience and would go back.",4
Best burger in Vegas. Staff could seem little more up beat.,4
"SOOOOO GOOD!!! the atmosphere of the restaurant was relaxed & a classic bar while still maintaining a high end feel, food was incredibly delicious and the staff r all very well informed of the menu & friendly.",5
Honestly if you think the food is worth the price then you haven’t had good food.,1
"Delicious food, good wait staff. I do wish that the TVs wouldn't be everywhere.",5
Fish n chips were awesome! Loved the mushy peas!,5
"Great food, and our server mj was excellent as well. He may have forgotten our dessert, but also forgot to charge us for it so he gave it to us for free. Everything was fantastic, I ate as slowly as I could to savor every bite. And my girlfriend said it was the best meal she has ever had. Better than my own cooking!",5
"Very nice atmosphere and friendly staff ,  had the burger and wasn't disappointed but not the level I expected from a Gordon Ramsay location.",4
"Consistently good. Fish and chips in a joint like this, you can't go wrong.",5
"Service was good, food came out fast, was just disappointed in the food for the price.",3
"I wish I could give a lower rate.
Do yourself a favor and don't spend your money here. The food was gross and the service was way worse.

Beef Wellington was cold, tasted really bad and it was wet. The salad was worse. Can't even make a salad in this place.",1
Good atmosphere and the steak was amazing but they kept on forgetting our appatiezer didn't get it till after the main course. And with it being my first time here they didn't ask about my ceasers rewards so I lost out on points,3
The bangers and mash was good. Three type of sausage and the gravy was a nice touch.,5
Food was fabulous. Our server Sara was the best! A great Birthday dinner for my granddaughter.,5
"For a ""pub and grill"", I expected to see a menu with more sandwiches and burgers.  This was mostly steaks.  The one burger on the menu was uber expensive.   Tasted great, but not worth the price.",2
"They should be embarassed of the ""pot pie."" Marie Calendar would humiliate Gordon Ramsey in a cook off.",3
3 course was good except the ceaser salad was meh. Beef wellington was on point.,4
"You will not be disappointed! Literally the best non traditional nachos I've ever had! The best spinach dip, the best grilled cheese and OMG the beef wellington! Don't fool yourself this isn't some over priced hotel pub it's a Gordon Ramsey establishment through and through. Each dish is original and innovative and they way they have restaurant organized to be socially distanced and safe is both highly cautious and yet efficient. I would highlyghly recommend!",5
Beef Wellington was great. Steak was cooked perfect. Great atmosphere and service,5
"Restaurant nice environment, great customer service, cost of Ceasers salad over priced with chicken. Like it's located within hotel Ceasers Palace.",3
"My family had the best time here! We made a reservation just to be safe and we got seated right away. But we weren’t greeted by our server for about 15 minutes (it gets better I promise). Our server was Michael and after helping his other tables, he came over and quickly apologized and got us water and put our food order in. Even after helping us, he was still running about and being busy with the other tables he had. So after we ate our delicious food, he dropped off dessert spoons for our entire table. We were really confused at first but then he brought us TWO desserts. We told him we didn’t order any, but then he said “this is a thank you for being so patient with me tonight”. After this experience, we will DEFINITELY be coming back.",5
"Beef Wellington is amazing, and the staff was super friendly.",5
"Everything about our experience was amazing - from our helpful waitress (Yaneisy) all the way to the sticky toffee pudding.

Presentation of my drink (Parliament Pride) was fun (liquid was brought out in a smoked filled bottle, mixed around and then served), and was delicious as well.

The Wagyu steak was cooked to perfection - had peppercorn sauce with it but didn't end up using it aside from a small bite or two, the steak really spoke for itself.

Girlfriend got fish and chips, which I helped finish as well and was very happy with.

Although not initially planning on getting dessert, Yaneisy made a great suggestion on the sticky toffee pudding.

Perfect impromptu lunch!",5
Waiter not very customer engaged. Food was good. Asked for extras vinegar and took 10 minutes to get.,4
Great food and service!!!!! Slajun was my server!!! He was a superstar!!!!!,5
"food is mediocre , happy hour deals are good.  the server was great. he had way too big of a section for one server to handle, poor guy",3
"The entrance to the restaurant is England inspired and it looks really cool because it has an iconic phone booth as a door. Inside is really small as well but there are a few tables to eat outside.

The concept of the place is interesting and I like that you can watch the employees cook the food. The fact that you can choose two different sauces is a plus as well because I prefer variation! The food was mediocre at best though; the fish had way too much batter and the fries were over cooked. If my memory serves me correct, you are served 3 pieces of fish, which is a decent portion but you can get tired of the fried taste after a while.",3
AWESOME SERVICE & FOOD!,5
Food was plentiful and delicious. Must stop on your trip.,5
"Pricey but tasty, the shortrib beef was very nice.",4
"Great atmosphere
Good food
Good company",4
Great Burger and fish & chips.  Friendly staff too.,5
"For as much of a stickler Gordon Ramsay is for quality of food, I was a bit disappointed,  breading falling off of fish and a bit mushy,  under cooked fries or as he would call them chips and service was mediocre.",4
"Eh. It was overpriced for average tasting food, the best item on our table was the truffle fries. I admit, they were very good. At least, I can say I went!",2
"Our second disappointment with a Ramsay restaurant. Our server was great but the food greasy and nothing special and especially for the hype. The burger was ok, not great. For the money I will pay the extra 15 for a killer massive, perfectly cooked burger at Old Homestead with way better fries than the truffle fries at Ramsay's. My wife and I swapped dishes as she didn't like the grilled cheese with beef. I liked hers better than the burger but very greasy as I said.",3
"Tasteless food and high prices makes it worst.
Service was good.
Expectations were tooooo high with disappointing results.
Had the onion soup but couldn’t eat it; it taste like can soup. salad was good ate all. the Roasted beef wellington with potatoes purée was awful 😢 i ate the vegetables, potatoes purée taste like box mashed potatoes did not eat, the sauce it did not taste good, did not eat. and beef was tasteless but super tender as butter but the bread and mushrooms that enclosed the beef was awful i removed and i ate 50% of beef.
Desert was just as bad, i eat the ice cream.",2
Stayed at Caesars palace and my husband and I decided to have fish and chips. The service was excellent the waitress was amazingly nice and really nice to speak with and gave suggestions on what beers to have with our meal. The fish and Chips was very nice not too oily and the fish was just right. Nice British touch in the middle of the vegas desert. Highly recommend.,5
"One of the best fish and Chips places I have tried. the fish was flaky, fresh and the batter was very light and fluffy. The sauces wer very good, I liked the curry one.",5
"My husband and I were pretty disappointed with our experience here. The service was very slow and not up to par for a restaurant with this kind of pricing. We were served extremely warm water (no ice), waited 10 minutes for our sodas to arrive, and watched our waiter put our order in 18 minutes after we ordered. The only reason we didn’t complain was because we felt bad he was the only one serving at least 8 tables. The food was alright. I had the filet and asked for it medium well, but it came out medium. The same happened for my husband who ordered the NY strip. Typically when you have to pay for sides they are at least big enough to share. We ordered the asparagus and it came with about 8 spears. The mashed potatoes were a tiny bowl. The only “wow” moment was the sticky toffee pudding, though for $13 I would expect it to be bigger. Overall, I would not recommend this place and I wouldn’t go back. It was important to me to visit a Gordon Ramsay restaurant while in town because I am a fan of his shows, but I have experienced service 10x better and better food at other restaurants for less of a cost. We spent $205 on just the two steaks, two sodas, two sides and one dessert.",3
Solid but unremarkable food. And expensive for what you get.,3
"We tried to go to Hell's kitchen but it seems as if you can only get in with a reservation and on top of that they're booked till June. So we came to the pub and grill and they sat us right away which was really nice. We really wanted to try the Beef Wellington but it looks like it was an option only for the three course meal but our waiter said we could get it a la carte but he should have just told us for $10 more we could just enjoy the three course meal. We ordered and 5 minutes later our food was already at the table. I personally don't like my food to come out that fast because it makes it seem as if it was just sitting in the window. Though the food was good and I don't have any complaints about it, I feel like it was way overpriced. The Beef Wellington was cooked to perfection but it wasn't anything special. I probably would pay $25 to $32 but they have it priced at $64 ala carte. Also the fish and chips were pretty basic something I could easily get in San Diego and that was about $31 which should probably be priced around $18 to $22. Maybe if Gordon Ramsay was actually in the kitchen cooking I'd feel better paying the prices LOL but we are overall glad we tried it but we probably wouldn't go back.",3
"The wait staff was horrible , we sat being ignored for what seemed like forever , then food took forever to arrive my wife's onion soup was ok - her lobster pot pie was good my beef Wellington was ice cold as we're the mashed potatoes. I would not recommend this place and we will not be visiting any Ramsey restaurants in the future. Denny's would be better!",2
"Had a wonderful dinner, one of the best dining experiences of my life.",5
Great food and service. Safe feeling and clearly proactive precautions are in place,5
The food was great!  I got the nachos made with potato so it was a nice twist on traditional nachos.  The prime rib was soooo tender and the most unique smoke flavor to it.  The toffee pudding was to die for.  It it one of the best desserts I have ever had in my life!,5
"Very nice, great service",5
I've been all over the world and will literally go out of my way to eat here. Literally. Get the beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding and thank me later. Just posting this review makes me want to go back.,5
"I've been to many British pubs, and this one does not resemble any of them in the least. Food was good, but classic pub foods that I've seen Ramsey prepare, we're not on the menu. No shepherd's pie. No bangers and mash. Very disappointed.",3
"I got the burger and a Long Island iced tea and it was all amazing!! I enjoyed the atmosphere and the tvs were playing sports events, which was nice. My server wasn't that great. He seemed annoyed and impatient when we asked for anything. We never got water refills or if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. We asked for our checks and he walked away before we could ask it be split amongst us. He made a big deal of splitting our check after that. I'd go back, but if the next server acted that way, I'd probably avoid going again.",3
Due to COVID they are only offering limited seating so the wait is very long which is no problem. So I thought we would order takeout which seems simple enough. We got Kevin at the bar. Very helpful for a moment. We ordered the burger and updated to the truffle fries for an addition charge. He then took our order and handed us a receipt. Then disappeared not taking our payment. Okay fine. We got a different fellow who ended up tipping anyways and then he told us our wait time would be about 20 to 25 minutes. He told us that they will take our phone number down and text us when the food was ready. Okay. We went to get a pizza for the kids that took about almost 40 minutes. While waiting for the pizza I was also waiting for the text message about 50 minutes later we got back to the restaurant and waited in a long line to pick up our order hoping to receive the text message after waiting for about 10 minutes I decided to just walk to the bar and see if our food was ready. As I was walking towards the bar I noticed our food sitting behind the hostess area. I have no idea how long it was sitting there but she was trying to clear the long line before she ended up texting us it seems. We got back up to the room and the food was really cold almost as if it was sitting there for a very long time the fries were soggy and we have no idea what the sauces were. Even the vegetables for the burger really warm luckily they didn’t put them on the burger to become soggy really disappointed in the pick up it was a simple pick up to I don’t understand why they made it so complicated I gave it to stars for the decor looks really nice in there I hope when Covidit is over the service is better.,2
It's good I just believe the burger place is better.,4
"Great food, service also was great.",5
"Perfect atomsfer, friendly stuff and super tasty food, what else you want",5
The food was excellent and Sarah was an outstanding waitress.,5
"It was good...less than I expected from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, but it was good.  Definitely hit it if you are in the area...",3
"Best fish & chips and short rib nachos I ever had! Great fast service, good prices and outstanding food! Nice big pub and neat view right into the casino! Great experience!",5
Fabulous food and great wait staff,5
Food was disappointing. Drinks were good.  Ramsey needs to check in on this place as quality is lacking.,3
"We had the Pub Burgers, my wife had mashed potatoes and I had the fries. The burgers were everything you'd expect from a Gordon Ramsay establishment.  What we didn't expect was the exceptional wait staff; from a midrange priced pub built by a celebrity chef, our expectations of the wait staff weren't too high. During our time here, we were absolutely amazed by the friendly atmosphere and service, from the greeter to the bus, and especially our waitress. Amazing experience all around.",5
Disappointing with cheap and pathetic decor and noisy slot machines blaring nearby. The batter for the fish and chips is loaded with so much sugar it reminds me of the batter from Sonic’s chicken strips. Fries were rushed and undercooked. The Crispy Chicken Pallard was overcooked and very tough. The service was great and drinks were excellent but we came for the food.,1
"We got the prime rib, fish & chips, truffle fires and some nachos. Nachos and fries were excellent! Prime rib was ok, definitely not with it for almost $60.. fish and chips where bland..

Save your money and go somewhere else.",2
Pricey! Fish was fried to perfection and fresh. Dipping sauces were excellent my personal favorites= Sriacha Aioli and Tartar.,4
We were there today for lunch. Great food and even better service. Scott was an amazing server and the busser was very personable.,5
People are especially nice and the food was AMAZING I really want to come here again,5
Delicious and much cheaper than eating at Hells Kitchen. Definitely go for lunch,4
"My family and I wanted to try this restaurant based on Gordon Ramsey’s name.  However, we were sadly disappointed. The fish and chips were bland and not seasoned correctly. Two of us ordered the Santa Carota filet mignon medium but it came out well done. We were left eating our sides (mashed potatoes and asparagus) while we waited. After our filet mignons came back out, only 1 was cooked correctly. Highly disappointed when our expectations were so high",2
"Outstanding service, food was perfect, atmosphere was quiet and casual. Highly recommend",5
Great food and great service,5
Service good. Had fish and chips. Pricy,4
Friendly staff greeted and served us. The meal was delicious.,5
The food was ok but the problem I had was the waiter did not come to ask if we were ok he just came over added water and left not asking if I wanted a refill then my husband wanted some salt and had to ask a different server for some salt because he was too busy laughing and chatting for 30 mins with someone yes I timed it would. I return not likely,3
"The one place that didn't have a long wait and had reasonable prices. My lobster pot pie was quite good, but my boyfriends pot roast was pretty dry. Overall a bit of a let down, wouldn't return.",3
"We love it here! Conveniently located inside of Caesars without a long walk from the casino. It's usually busy, especially before or after a show. The service could be better - the waitress took our order and then someone else brought out the food, I do realize that sometimes this makes the food come out faster, but it didn't come out how we ordered it and the waitress never came back to make sure it was ok. We needed other things, and had to wait. Took too long to get a second round of drinks also. It is pricey, but the food is good. We enjoyed the Scotch Eggs, however it came out just one egg. We ordered fry's well done and hot, they were cold and limp. We will try it again and give it another chance. We love Gordon and wish him all the best.",4
"Fun time, our waiter Eduardo was great",5
The food was good. The drinks were great!,4
Little rare but good,4
"Filet mignon was very good.  Overpriced for an entree without a side though in my opinion.  The fish and chips....i never expected to be that disappointed. Im not exaggerating,  it was actually very much flavorless. I mean entirely. It was cooked well, but no seasoning at all. I thought fish and chips could taste good without needing to dip it in ketchup or tartar sauce.  But maybe it's just me. This really shocked me",3
Awesome pub. Great apps. Stellar service.,5
"Great service, however more expensive than expected",4
"Okay food, extremely overpriced.",3
Delicious cocktails and melt in your mouth beef. Best sticky date pudding of my life so far.,5
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE !!!This place is disgusting!!! Super over priced and the food is gross i got a rib cheese melt and my husband got a New York steak the steak doesn’t come with ANY sides it’s literally just the steak and it’s $60 and my cheese melt was disgusting and I paid $35 for it .,1
"We must have went on an off night for the kitchen. The food was barely above local diner  standards.  We had fish & chips and the braised short rib.  There's no way Gordon Ramsay would approve of what came out that kitchen..

Edit.  Added a star after response from the restaurant.",3
"Highly Overrated and Overpriced, rude service. Beef Wellington was bland.",2
I was very disappointed about the chicken sandwich. I expected more from an Ramsay restaurant. It's like the chicken was over cooked or they needed to change out the cooking oil. I've been to another place of his and it was alot different.,3
Went here tonight with 6 friends and was expecting a wow factor you know cuz of expectations from his show and for sure because of the price. I mean don’t get me wrong it was good and all but not good for the price we were charged and each little side if we wanted one was extra as hella too. A little disappointed we were. Not as much flavor as we expected and service was kind of not favorable kind of rude and snobby. For price we were expecting an amazing wow factor and decent hospitality and we did not get that. Felt like we were annoying them when trying to spend money with them.,2
Got to try this burger!  This fish and chip burger was better than the $26 lobster-shrimp burger.,5
"The food was bland and over priced. I had the fish and chips, the batter on the fish was nothing special and the fish had no taste. I paid $3 extra for the truffle fries which turned out to be disappointing to say the least. The mushy peas that came with the meal flavorless worst than baby food. The diet pepsi was so flat I had to send it back. I wouldn't recommend this place.",1
This place is excellent! Wonderful service and the food is amazing!,5
"I ate here on March 3rd, 2021. The hostess and server were very nice. The food kind of let me down. I ate the truffle and spinach dip, which was pretty good. I then tried a grilled cheese with I think it was tri tip? It was some beef product, but I can't recall. My food came out cool/luke-warm and the grilled cheese was so soggy with oil that I didn't finish.

Maybe I just made a poor choice from the menu. It seems my exprience is not typical for here, so please see other reviews too.",3
Delicious food 18 dollars for a ceasar salad which was pretty tiny!  Homemade cheese sauce on the nachos. $25 dollar burger $9 for fries.  82+ for all that.  No drinks.  Expensive for sure.  Average,4
Good meal fantastic onion soup,5
Good stuff.,4
"Have visited this Pub twice and both times the food and service were AMAZING! Lobster Mac and cheese was delicious, and you have to go here if anything for the Sticky Toffee Pudding!!! It melts in your mouth and you won’t want to share it lol!!",5
Great experience!   Love the beer pairings with the 3 course dinner.,5
A bit over price with small portions. Our waiter was not to responsive as well,3
My wife and I ordered the three course meal to try the infamous beef Wellington and both of us were really disappointed by it especially for the price. It left a pretty bad after taste in our mouths afterwards and were expecting more especially coming from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.,2
The food was excellent atmosphere was very good great staff friendly and fast,5
"Food tasted great and there was a good beer selection.  Service was fantastic - pleasant, very attentive, and quick with getting food and drinks back to the table.",4
Good food great service,5
"My husband and I came to Caesars Palace expecting a better selection of food and restaurants. When we saw the Homestead steak house we walked up to get a table but couldn’t be seated because they were closing soon. It’s  Friday night wouldn’t think a steak house would close before 10:30. So the host told us Gordon Ramsey’s was open and could seat us. First off the menu was pricey I wanted to leave before we even were seated but my husband wanted to stay because he was hungry and he thinks Gordon Ramsey’s show is awesome and expected the food to be great. Big mistake!!! The waiter had no personality we ordered the New York strip and mashed potatoes. He never came back after our steak was brought out to ask if it was okay or if we needed anything. The person he/she honestly I wasn’t sure which it was because of the mask , was rude when they brought the steak to the table. I asked for an extra plate and was rudely told it was there I didn’t see it. The service for a place this pricey should be top notch. But the food should be great number one! It was just okay to me. The steak had no flavor I’ve had much better steaks elsewhere. Just a huge disappointment for such an expensive meal. Would’ve given more stars if service was better but it was terrible. I had to ask for our check when food was finished because he never even brought more water. Bad experience!!",1
"Party of 10 celebrating Birthday and Fathers Day. Completely disappointed hate to say, OUT of two staple menu items 7:30 dinner Wellington and Prime Rib just mind-boggling Dirty eating utensils and I can go on and on…",2
Loads of pubby goodness.,4
Everything was very nice the food was out of the world steak cooked to perfection potatoes yellow but I got to yell to the end about them nachos they were the best I ever had got to go there again just to get them,5
Way over priced for the food you get. My steak was way to dry and seasoned. You don't over season a steak.,3
Train your staff to drain the food! Originally from an English Colony (New Zealand) where we eat a lot of fish and chips I was very disappointed.  I watched the staff 3 times take hot food straight from the fryer shake it once (no drain time) then into a bowl still dripping. They did the same with the fries but also put them on top of older fries! The photo does not clearly show it but I had 2 sets of fries in my box. The sausage batter was greasy and the sausage full of oil that sprayed  everywhere when I bit it. The chips were not english chips they were more like american fries.  On a positive the restaurant environment seemed clean and modern and the fish was moist and tender. For all Gordons yelling at people and standards he has left this place to fleece tourists not provide quality. We could not finish the small box so we are voting with our wallet ... we won't be back.,1
Ordered the braised short rib. Felt like it was about on par with some of the rib dishes I've made. Very well done.,5
This was an underwhelming experience after going to Hell's Kitchen. I ordered the lobster pot pie. It wasn't very flavorful and honestly seemed like it could be from a can. The puff pastry on top was very tough and the lobster was overcooked. The service was fast and friendly. For the price though the food should have been much better.,4
The freaking short rib nachos were awesome!!!!,5
I ate one of the best steaks I’ve ever tried in my life. Make sure to also try a dessert,5
We  had a awesome  time  food  was great  totally  incredible  place,5
Good place good fish and chips,5
Mmmmmmm,5
I honestly wished I would've read the reviews . it was our first time here and me and my husband had been really excited to try . unfortunately it was disappointing the service was horrible the waiter barely acknowledge us  . I order the wellington and it was not good. the we tried drinks and they were worse . extremely disappointing . right after we went straight to white castle lol  awww,1
Very good food and excellent service,5
"I came here with a lot of expectations, but none of us from our group liked not even a single item. Almost every one of us ordered crispy chicken gillard. It is crispy but I felt like the chicken went for a swim in oil. Even the platting of food doesn't look like I have paid 40$ for one entree. Totally disappointed with it.",1
"The food on point, the taste, the drinks, the everything 🤤 you have to try this place, you just need to ! 😍💸",5
Make sure you try the sticky toffee pudding!,4
"It was good but not for the money spent.
There are better steak houses for alot less money. Service was ok.",2
I love Gordon Ramsay and this place was fun.  The Casino itself is particularly tacky but this restaurant was great and it was downright mind-blowing how fast our food was served to us.  This is place is exactly what you'd expect it to be.  Almost like a pub at Disney World.,5
"Try to book reservations ahead. Walk-ins are not allowed now. You can order takeout, but you would enjoy restaurant experience more.",4
"Had a Chicken sandwich. A $4 chicken sandwich from popeyes is much better than theirs 30$.
Overpriced, overhyped.
Go here only if u care to have a celebrity chef name in your dump the next morning.",1
Beef Wellington you can cut with a fork! Delicious!,5
"Wasn't what I expected. Had higher expectations for the food but again, it's Vegas and basically paying for the name.",3
"Went for a nice lunch with my dad for his birthday.  No wait, but the food was cold (had the beef wellington) and the pretzels on the brownie were stale.",3
"Best stakes,  really good service!",5
Very good fish and chips. The batter was just right (not too heavy and/or greasy). The sauces (Sriracha and cilantro tartar) complemented it quite well.,4
"Excellent experience here, basically no wait for a part of 8 with no reservation. Our waiter was amazing and went above and beyond to make our experience enjoyable. The food was absolutely delicious.",5
Service was average the menu is very limited the food is amazing something you have to at least try once,4
Crispy cod with tasty dirty fries! Pretty damn good food!,4
Ate there on Saturday night.  Server was slow and took long time to take drink order and deliver.   Ordered nachos very good . When server returned seemed surprised we wanted to order food .  Braised ribs were excellent and great portion.  The fish and chips were eh breading was mushy  and chips were cold. Asked for check and took 0ver 10 minutes to recieve with waiter findling with glasses elsewhere.  He then stated they were short handed yet other tables moved quicker and in timely manner.  Was not the experience expected from a restaurant owned by a renowned chef,3
"Worse food ever. Braised short rid was so hard we had to ask around for a steak knife to cut it.

Waiter showed up to take or order then dissapeared and never saw him again.",1
Great food! Staff was friendly.,5
"The Best! I think we set in at a perfect time.
Because everything was perfect.",5
Very cool! Our server was amazing!,5
"I got crispy chicken which basically tasted like three day old KFC. So greasy, and too hard to cut.
We got a table right away but had to wait forever to be waited on.",1
Food was ok... Not warm enough. Was not that impressed...,3
Very good except the grease... my sandwich and my husbands were soooooo full of grease....,5
Best steak we have ever eaten.  Service was awesome. 10/10,5
Very artistic food ..a bit expensive yet worth it indeed,5
Lots of draft 🍺 here. Had the Fuller ESB on tap. Chill place.,4
"Good food, interesting Ramsey take on pub food.
I ordered the Tomato soup which was good and also the curry Carrots and Cauliflower side which was ok but not to my taste.
The downside is it closed on us around 11pm which is very weird being a PUB and grill in Las Vegas... I can understand closing the kitchen but they also closed the bar and kicked us out eventually. Not cool.",3
Very light and clean fish and chips! Expensive but so is everything near the strip. The truffle fries were my favorite of the options!,5
Poor service and very disappointed on quality of food. Seems the franchise is only maintaining Gordan Ramseys name and not his unique and delicious quality of food he is known for.,2
Good pub fare at above average prices.,3
"Being from the uk and having never been to a gordon ramsay restaurant, we where excited to try it. Great beer selection and staff where fantastic. Menu was very limited so we opted for fish and chips as it's hard to find good fish and chips in the usa 😂. It wasn't the best we have had but still was really nice so no complaints. I guess it's because of the location the price is so high. $32 for a fish and chips .",4
Good meal. Great service.,5
"We all got steak and ale pie.  The crust was perfect. My only issue with the pie was I had very little of the delicious steak in mine, it was primarily mushrooms.
The sides didn’t really work for us, the pretzel and almost raw vegetables didn’t really fit with the meal.  Some bubble and squeak would be great!
The scotch egg appetizer was really good.  We also enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.
The restaurant atmosphere was fun and the waiter was wonderful.",4
"It was nice,  cold beer! I wish the fish was a little better.",4
"I wanted to like this place SOOO bad. I’m a huge Gordon Ramsay fan. Our food took forever, but I didn’t complain because like I said I tried my hardest to like this place. Gordon would be ashamed. The cod was greasy. When we got back to the hotel, we both felt sick. I will try another restaurant of Gordon’s, but not this one. :(",1
"Food, atmosphere, hospitality is all amazing. The location however, isnt the best. Loud and crowded. But still a grand experience",4
"Good food. Good steak and Wellington but not the best. Price considered, drops star to 3.5-4.",4
"No flavor,  ordered the new york steak. No seasonings. Ok with the price  if I get quality meat. Was seered till burnt flavor was on a medium steak. Not happy at all. Hells kitchen way better. Service is mediocre at best. Our server was slow and unattentive..... very displeased..",2
My husband had the stake it had 0 flavor was burnt on top but cooked perfectly in the middle. Very disappointed since we came from arizona for Gordons food. My food was amazing but unfortunately my husband was not.,3
Wonderful food and service!,5
The steak and appetizer were okay. The waiter was suuupppeeerrr slow and seems as if he wasn't concerned about our table.,4
"Amazing food, the burgers bites were absolutely delicious !",5
Oh great food!,5
Great food but a bit pricy.,4
Great food and you can still order the same Pre Fixe meal as the main Hells Kitchen right outside Ceasars.  The beef Wellington is to die for...sooo good.  This place also has a great smoked whiskey you must try...fun to watch as they set it up.,5
Avoid at all costs. Place serves sub par food for a ridiculous price. The design of the place provides you with a pure chaodic experience. You are forced to get a combo and a drink. No discount for military. I'll never go back.,1
My least favorite GR in vegas,4
Best place to eat hands down while out there🔥👌🔥👌,5
"Food and drinks were good, the price definitely reflects the name and the convenience of the restaurant. be weary to throw some extra $$$. we came from Hell’s Kitchen the previous night and that set the bar much higher then what was achieved this evening, overall not too bad.",4
"Lobster Roll, Onion soup, Ceasar salad, and Beef Wellington were to die for",5
"Stopped in for lunch.  Really poor service.  The chicken sandwich was $24 (lunch price) without fries (a side of fries was another $9).  Get the heck out of here.  I ordered it because everything was about the same price on the lunch menu (except the $59 3-course menu, for lunch, REALLY!?!).  Honestly, the $3.99 chicken sandwich at Popeyes not only tastes better, it is also twice the size.

Gordon is going to flame out hard here in a few years, just like Emeril did over a decade ago.",1
"Food was okay, but service was slow! Took almost 2 hours to get lunch. I realize there are staffing and space limitations, but please set reasonable expectations for your guests.",3
10 out of 10 on all of it. Glad we stopped in.,5
Great food and atmosphere,5
3 course dinner was amazing,5
Truffle fries are amazing!!!! Sauces are to die for,5
Superb food.5 star rating..,5
Loved the food great flavor ! Had the truffle fries the maine lobster and shrimp rolls and the braised short rib will be coming back!,5
Enjoyed my prime rib and truffle fries on the side in this gastropub done Vegas-style,5
"The short rib nachos were excellent but the fish and chips were surprisingly poor. I have had the fish and chips at the Gordon Ramsay fish shop by the Linqs and they were excellent. At the Pub,  the batter underneath the crisp outer shell was doughy and undercooked. I showed it to my server who agreed and said she would take it off our bill. She then took it to the chef who said there was nothing wrong with it. I was very dissapointed that the Pub could not replicate the quality of the fish I got at the fish shop for half the price.",3
Got the chance to experience the Beef Wellington .  A long awaited treat,5
"I had high expectations for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, but was not impressed. I ordered the salmon dish and it was dry, fishy and I had to add salt to my vegetables... which if you watch any of Gordon’s shows, you know not having seasoning is a huge pet peeve of his.",3
Great food and friendly service.,5
Great food nice atmosphere,5
The Fish and Chips were great.,5
Being an executive chef in Manhattan for 20+ years this place is way overpriced with average food. What makes chicken Caesar salad worth $31.00 or short rib $50.00. Would never consider eating there again. Server was great,1
Fabulous food i had the Beef wellington and it lives up to the Gordon Ramsey name! It is on the spendy side but worth every penny,5
Pretty expensive for what you get.  Also we both asked for medium on our two different meats and they were both very rare.,3
"Folks, the staff here are friendly as you can get. Happy hours are between 2 and 5 pm Mon - Fri. Great prices on beer , house wine and appetizers. You have to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding for it's to die for. This establishment is owned by the man himself Chef Ramsay. This is the first place you must visit during your visit to Las Vegas.  You would be crazy not to come by and try all their meals. It's a great place to gather among friends and family members. If you have a favorite sport you like to watch, guarantee you will find it here. They have so many televisions in their establishment. Do me a favor ? If you have a chance, see Ronnie and Warner for they will take care of you. I promise you that. 😀",5
"It's a nice restaurant, but the portions are less than other restaurants in Las Vegas compared to the price.",4
Excellence in every way.,5
"I had the tomato soup and it was delicious! My boyfriend had the steak and was a little unimpressed with it, said it could have been better. They were very clean though! Wiped down everything after someone used it and wore masks and gloves. Definitely pricey",4
Beware. Food is not what you think at this ramsay place. We got frozen burgers and an insane bill. McDonald's is a better meal then here.,1
Not a fan of their fish and chips.  Greasy and lacked seasoning.  Waiter did not want to be at work😒,2
The fish was great as well as the tartar sauce and Southwest ranch. The chips/fries were ok at best. I thought it was a bit overpriced but you are paying for the name and the experience.,4
Beautiful Casino as well as the food was delicious but are overpriced. $27 for a burger.,4
"Good atmosphere, good food. Friendly service.",4
"Had an amazing birthday dinner this past weekend. Server was very professional and on point. Food was great, received a birthday cake with icecream that was delicious.
Definitely will eat there again.",5
Decent burger,4
"Service neglected our truffle fries, served them halfway through the meal after we were almost done. First, Burgers were nearly unseasoned. One of us ordered a gluten free option. THEY HAVE NO GLUTEN FREE BUN. Yes, ive read that GR has awesome GF buns too. They dont have them here. Additionally, medium rare is apparently hard for the cooks. My date and i order our burgers medium rare. Hers came out cool and chewy and mine came out over cooked.

They do serve a ""lettuce wrap"" option. Trust me, Wendys is better and doesnt cost 26.00 for wilted lettuce and cold fries. Red Robin uses iceberg to give it substance. Up the game a LITTLE.

Extremely dissapointed.

Walk on by, save yourself 26.00, and go to smash burger just around the corner in ceasers.",1
Great and fast,5
The pub burger is really good,5
"Quick service, delicious crunchy fish. Servings could have more quantity, lots of chips not much fish.",4
"Hours say they close at midnight, arrived at 10:30 and we were ignored until we asked and the hostess told us they were closed 🙄",1
"I ordered the sliders,  it was a great choice!",4
Nice service,3
The staff are friendly and nice. The foods are delicious. I enjoyed eating here with my friend. The price are $$$.,4
Awesome. And great service from Taylor-thank you!,5
Excellent atmosphere... staff was very helpful and the shepards pie was beyond good!!!,5
They didn't even have butter.,2
"Amazing food, it's  worth going here..",5
Lobster mac and cheese was cool. Only moderately warm in the center.  Drink was fabulous but waited 15 minutes.  Waitress was basically non existent. Went to Hells Kitchen before and firmly believed this would be on similar standards.,1
The food was good. I had a drink that was recommended that was ok. I did really like the salmon.,4
"I haven't eat Beef Wellington for 7 years, almost forgot why do I like it in the first place.

The Gordon Ramsay tasting menu is quite a nice one that I would recommend to anyone who want to try it out. It will be nice the desert can change to something less sweet.

My only issue is the casino behind me is quite noisy and I prefer quiet place.",4
"Over priced ,my burger was good hubby shepherd pie average",3
food over priced and very bland. And the server rushed us with our orderd.,1
"The food was really, really great. Sublime, even. What leaves room for improvement was the service that Michael W provided me and my husband with tonight. Maybe it’s because we are relatively young patrons, but Michael gave far-less-than-excellent service to us tonight, while I noticed that he seemed more attentive to other tables. Not only was he inattentive, but he seemed rather disgruntled when interacting with us. Perhaps he was having an off day, but for those reasons I can only give two stars, as service means very much to me and my enjoyment of a venue.",2
"Good food especially the nachos, not cheap but what is in Vegas",4
Best meal I've ever had. Every bite was excellent. Staff was amazing.  Would recommend to everyone.,5
Great flavors,5
"We love Gorden Ramsay and watch almost all his shows. Recently went to this restaurant and the fish and chips were good, but the nachos were not. Soggy. 😩smashed peas on the fish and chips were cold. We know from Watching his shows Gordan Ramsay would want to know.",2
Awesome experience.,5
The toffee dessert is life,5
"Huge Ramsay fan. Traveled to Vegas and made reservation at the pub and grill. The food was amazing. But being that I’m a huge Ramsay fan, just leaving some notes he may find helpful. Because I watch kitchen nightmares, I wanted to make sure I looked everywhere lol I was genuinely interested in seeing if this restaurant could pass inspection. So I looked under the table..found a giant piece of gum stuck under the table.... Then the service was exceptionally slow, and it wasn’t even busy, there were only 6 tables sat, and my dad was repeatedly saying where’s the waiter, where’s our drinks.

Now when the food came we were all very impressed, and I’d rate the experience as a great one. I bought a Ramsay magnet lol but man, gum under the table, Ramsay would shut the place down if he saw that....",4
Friendly bartenders and wait staff. Even with a reservation be prepared to wait in line to check in and then wait for a host to seat you. The beef Wellington is one of a kind. Toffee cake with ice cream was a nice treat. Slow overall service. From reservation time to exit was about 90 minutes. Bartenders and drink selection was excellent.,4
"The Lobster breaded appetizer is so delicious, the cheese burger is fine too.",4
The Short Rib nachos were the star of the show!,5
One of my favorite pubs in Vegas,5
"Great food, Great drinks, Great customer service!!! No wait time",5
Amazing experience,5
Fabulous food and great service. I’d go back again & again!,5
"I just want to start off by saying our service was top notch. I didn’t ask for things to be taken off, because it wasn’t his fault, and I wanted to review without comps, or refunds. Just face value. With that being said, I just paid $180 for 2 just to have overpriced, bland, and old frying oil-food. We will start with the apps. Ordered Lobster Rolls, and Artichoke & Spinach Dip. Lobster rolls should have been on a smaller bun, filling needed more salt, but was okay. It was pretty much a meal, instead of small bites. Artichoke dip was great, the pita or whatever it was, was not. They tasted like old frying oil, and they were hard to chew.
We both got the fish and chips. The fish portion was huge and greasy. Maybe another type of fish, or smaller cuts? It was overwhelming. I couldn’t finish my meal. The fish wasn’t seasoned, and the batter was bland. Also plating was inconsistent; one of us had lemon on our plate, the other didn’t. Fries were delicious. Just as a point of reference, I’m a local and eat at Fish and Chips all the time at Linq pre covid. This is how it should taste every time. I love you Chef Ramsay, but eating here was painful, because of how much I idolize your work.
Would I come back? No.
Just go to Fish and Chips at Linq. You will pay half the price for better food.
It makes me scared to want to try HK now. We have reservations next week. I’ll tell you how that goes.",2
Best fish and chips anywhere!,5
Great happy hour with good beers,4
"My family loved it, everything was wonderful! The decor is interesting and fun, the staff was all top notch (I wish I remembered our waiter’s name, he was super friendly), and the food was delicious. My husband got the steak and ale pie, I had the chicken curry, my son got sliders and truffle fries, and my daughter got a bacon cheeseburger. Everything was so good, the portions were perfect, and we had such a blast. Thank you for a great dinner!",5
Great tasting food with reasonable prices,5
One of the best chicken tenders I've had!,5
Excellent service and great food.,5
Excellent happy hour. Great beer and wine selection.,5
"Did not receive  apertizer  before dinner, prime rib was full uf fat,no very happy",2
"Had short ribs w/cabbage, mash potatoes and gravy and my favorite beer, Samuel Adams. It was delicious, especially while watching the Lakers beat the Nuggets! At over  $50.00 I thought it was a bit overpriced but I guess that's what the need to charge t I pay the bills and turn a profit!",4
I go to Vegas to eat. With all the food options it’s like paradise for me. So when I say that the duck pot I got here was the best meal I had in Vegas it’s very high praise. It’s duck cooked in its own fat served chilled with rye toast. I don’t even like rye toast but put this duck on it and it’s damn near the best thing I’ve ever eaten. Add to that the beef Wellington I also got that just nearly lost to the duck as the best meal I’ve had I Vegas and this place is definitely a place you have to try. I will be back and I’m going to be ecstatic when I am.,5
"We waited 95 minutes for our food to arrive. Our table had short ribs,  chicken,  salmon,  butter chicken,  and I had scallops.   The rest of the tables dishes were excellent, mine was ok.  The scallops were gritty and slightly rubbery.   Not the standard I was expecting from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.   The toffee pudding we had for dessert was incredibly delicious.   I feel it was just an off night due to a packed restaurant, but this was my experience tonight.",3
"I ordered the lobster macaroni and cheese, it looked great but it didn't have enough flavor",3
Food was delicious 😋,5
Pretty good burger. Menu is very to the point.,4
The best burger i ever had1🥰😋😋😋💖😂👍👍,5
Food ok for a Pub staff nice,4
I got to Gordon Ramsay Burger. It was very good.,4
"Im a HUGE GR fan and was really excited to try one of his restaurants. I know Pub & Grill is not one of his finer dining experiences, however, I did expect my food to come out warm. Unfortunately, the pre fix menu was a dud. The Caesar salad was no more special than a pre packaged Caesar from Kroger, and the beef Wellington was completely cold. I would have sent it back, but I was STARVING, and my waiter kinda fell off the face of the earth. So, I ate what I could and prayed the sticky toffee pudding was a hit, and it was. Amazing sticky toffee pudding, but everything else was not worth the money, and more importantly, the time lost on a blah dinner.",2
I had the nachos for an appetizer and the fish and chips.  Both items were good. They both came out at the same time and the server said he was going to bring silverware so I waited 5 minutes then I hauled down another server. Finally went to the host at the front and got it. Then I went through the same thing with my soda. And I don’t wanna continue on with the negativity but the service was about as good as you would expect from a Del Taco in Whittier. Too bad. I was really looking forward to the experience because I’ve been a long time fan,2
"We got lucky because they were serving Gordon Ramsay's signature dish ""Beef Wellington"" it was $80 person for the course but worth every penny!  Just like you see them make on Hell's Kitchen!",5
"I came on a Friday night to try the shepherds pie. Even thou it was a nice dish and the service was rather good, I felt sick right after. Thus I cannot leave a positive review...",3
"You can't go wrong visiting this restaurant, the food was very tasty and the service top notch. Prices are not extremely high, considering the offerings around and the quality of the food.",5
Great food at service. Family get together was a great memories.,5
"Just OK... but better than the Forum food court. If you're gonna overpay at the food court, you might as well spend a few more on  this place.",3
Very good food,5
Delicious...,5
"We wanted to check out Gordon Ramsay's staple restaurant but it was booked out for 3 weeks so we settled with the Pub & Grill. I think it was overrated for food and ambiance in relation to the price. No it wasn't bad but it also didn't make an impression on me.

Is it worth it? Not really.

Would I go again? Not when I had much better experiences at other restaurants at Ceasers.",3
We had the Onion Soup and Beef Wellington and Sticky Toffee pudding.   The food was perfectly cooked.  Our server Roger was amazing.    Joe the Front of House manager was very helpful and working with his crew to keep everything moving.  Definitely coming back!,5
So my husband and I were seated and we waited...and we waited....and we waited and recieved no service. We walked out and that was that 💁‍♀️,1
Expensive but great food.,5
Expensive but worth every penny.  Excellent fish and chips! We've been there often and will definitely return!,5
Omg the beef wellington lives up to all the hype. Well worth the price of admission.,5
"Expensive...but good! If you know that going in, then you can just enjoy it!",5
Absolutely delicious!! My burger was full of a perfect combination of flavors. Best burger I have ever had!,5
I wish I could really met Mr. Ramsay because I watch his shows so I was so ready for a great extraordinary meal but no I got salty re cooked roast I think that is what it was.. I thought everything was cooked to order.. I know Mr. Ramsay wouldn't approve of this,2
"Expected much,  received less. Burger, ok. Lobster roll, ok. Soup, ok. Mashed potatoes,  good. Don't advertise yourself as an English ""pub,"" Union flag and all, and have only 4, I believe,  British beers on offer, only one of which is decent (Fullers ESB).",2
"Good service and you pay for the""Ramsey"" chef notoriety.",5
The best food I've ever had....ever,5
Fantastic reuben and environment!,5
The salmon was delightful!,5
I can only speak to the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was outstanding....a little better at Hell's Kitchen but still delicious. Oh good beer selection too. Service on point.,5
"The service, the food, its always awesome 👌",5
"Wonderful food!!! It was a great experience. Our waitperson, Ali, was amazing!",5
The Classic Ramsay Tasting Menu...Wowwie!,5
Bar service poor.,3
"It was a little pricey, but well worth it. Probably the best New York Steak.",5
Was severely disappointed when we came here and was told they were closed. Google maps said they were open until midnight and we were running out of options after lots of walking. Please fix the hours if you're not gonna go by the ones listed here.,2
"Amazing, must eat here.",5
Food was amazing. Recommend the Shepard's pie,5
Absolutely the best!!,5
"We went in for drinks and were forced to buy food after ordering drinks (they claimed this was supposedly due to COVID-19). We ordered fries, received a small quantity, and were surprised to be charged a whopping $13 for them. Drinks were relatively pricey as well.",2
"Great place to green a bite to eat. Upgrade you're chips too truffle fries. That's a champ move. You could lose at slots, get the truffle fries and you'll still feel like a winner. French onion soup is decent too.",4
Awesome,5
The Chicken never made it across the road because it was cooked brilliantly!!! Steak and ale pie was delicious!,5
Excellent food and Premier service!!,5
Delicious 😋 food and friendly staff! I recommend the fish and chips.,5
I just returned from 2 weeks in Ireland (we ate all kinds of  fish and chips)  maybe the chef needs to go to Ireland for good fish and chips. I have never tasted such bland food I think long john sliver would be better. The lobster Mac and cheese was the worse I've every had. Believe me I love Mac and cheese especially with lobster. I'm extremely disappointed burger at plant Hollywood is much better choice good food there. Never again at the Pub.,1
"Portions are small, but tasty.",4
"Do yourself a favor and get the Steak and Ale Pie. It is incredible! I spotted this on the menu and had to get it since I loved the one I had from a famous pub in London. Ramsay’s version is even better! After tasting mine, my husband ordered one for himself too. We both agreed that, even though we had some great food in Vegas, this is the best meal we had the entire trip.

Aside from the food, we also loved the atmosphere. Relaxed but still cool and put together. Servers were very friendly and took great care of us. Would recommend this place 1000%.",5
Easy to get reservations on a Monday evening. Hostess could have been more friendly and there seemed to be staff communication confusion. They forgot to serve us our appetizer which they compted and threw  in complementary desserts.,4
"Was okay, food was served a bit on the cold side",3
Loved it! I was not disappointed,5
"Great burgers!! Love this place, nachos are amazing!!",4
Very delicious food and great service.,5
Had Fish and chips. Fish was warm and mushy,2
"The food was good but overpriced. The server acted like it was an inconvenience having us there. 😞  Warm tap water to drink, no ice. Just not a lot of attention to detail. Expected more from a GR establishment.",2
"I  must say I was very disappointed.  My husband and I visited the establishment and we were very excited to go.  Our Marine son was going to drive up from Camp Pendleton to meet us for lunch.  We love a good burger but I feel they are hard to find.  With that in mind I decided to order one (come on this is Gordon Ramsey's Place they must be good, right?) I was asked how I would like it cooked.  I replied Medium Rare, and to my disappointed they cooked it WELL DONE.  So far off the mark!  Our son ordered the same and his was well done as well. Sadly, I wish our experience would have been better(it wasn't cheap) but it was nice to see our son.  Maybe it was just an off day.",1
Superb 5 Star dining.The Beef Wellington is amazing,5
Great Food!!!,5
Everything was tasty and made fairly quickly. Didn't care much for the fish and chips but the nachos and steak were fantastic.,5
"I expected more flavor and more food for the price.  My steak had no flavor, the lobster Mac and cheese only had a few pieces of lobster. The two stars  are only because they remade it and added more lobster meat. However it still tasted bland.  The truffle fries had the most flavor of all the food. The service was awesome and our waiter was very helpful and attentive.",2
Amazing food delicious cocktails and wonderful customer service,5
"It was very fast and delicious. There aren't many seats, but it was worth it for good food done so quickly.",5
"Hi Everyone - My food was excellent...but without drinks my wife and I came out at $177 with 15% tip.  Would I pay for this again?  Unlikely.  I got the tasting, which was actually a decent value for what you got at $80.  The Wellington itself was $60!  My meal included:

1. Two jumbo scallops - My favorite part
2. Two pieces of Wellington - Which was perfectly salted
3. Sticky toffee pudding w/Ice Cream - Delicious gooey coffee cake

As I said before, the meal was great, and I don't regret the experience at all.  I just don't think I could justify paying this price again...well maybe in a few years when the sting has worn off. :)",4
"Waiter was phenomenal,  food was amazing even with a limited menu.  Can't wait for them to be back to full force!!",5
"Outstanding, food service and not a long wait",5
"Probably one of the worst restaurants in Vegas. Not exaggerating. Went there with expectations that Ramsay himself would have set for his own restaurant and could not have been more disappointed. The service was abysmal. We had a server by the name of Tesla who took our drink orders and then we had to ask 20 minutes later on the status of them as they were just sitting up at the bar.  The food came approximately 39 minutes after we ordered, not a hard order, fish and chips, which could not have been anymore ordinary and average.  2 fish sticks, some fries, bland in flavor, for 30.00, a beer was 10.00. We never saw our server after we placed our order. She never came back to see if we received the correct order or if we wanted to order more beer. We had to flag her down to get the check which is when Tesla asked if everything came out correctly.. Too late to be asking that question. It appears this restaurant is purely running on name alone and not on quality  or service. For better service and food, there are million options to better spend your money.",1
"Being inside Caesar's was part of the experience of going to this restaurant. To me it was mostly about atmosphere because the food was OK. We sat at the outer edge overlooking  the casino. There were plenty of screens to see whatever sporting event was on TV. There was really nothing to complain about, but at the same time nothing to jump up-and-down about. The service was quick, which is great because if you are going to see a show you want to be able to get in-and-out. My nachos - braised shortrib atop kettle cooked potato chips - was unique and pretty good. All in all, it was a nice visit.",4
"Had the braised beef shirt ribs and cheesy mashed potatoes.  It was awesome, so much flavor!  For desert the sticky toffee pudding with ice cream was ridiculously good.  My server was very attentive and friendly.",5
Bloody good fish and chip! Awesome Bloody Mary!,4
"Wonderful service from Sladjan!  Great great food.  Chef even came out to ensure me my gluten free meal was safe. Steak was cooked to perfection.

Size of meals are not huge, but very good quality.   Prices are decent for a Vegas restaurant.",5
Expensive for no reason food is trash,1
"The fries were soggy and had no flavor, we spent more than $100 and everything was super over priced and no quality food. Not worth it",1
Beef wellington was amazing!,5
"Place is nice, but I was disappointed because menu doesn't include the famous Wellington's beef (Atlantic City Pub & Grill does). I strongly recommend cocktails and starters, that are really good. Considering price, meat is not so exceptional in my opinion.",3
Great food.,5
Loved the fish & chips 👌,5
"My 10 year old daughter's hero is Gordon Ramsay and this place did not disappoint.  $200 to feed a family of 4 with 2 young kids is pretty expensive but compared to other places around it, it's priced correctly.  We had the pork belly and braised ribs with truffle tries.  Everything was delightful and well worth the $ for the experience.",5
"I loved everything I ate, it was packed with amazing flavors and they gave me a free dessert for my birthday. I would definitely want to try all of his restaurants in the future. I would recommend to have the Yukon gold potatoes! Total yum!👏",5
Super overpriced.... just like the rest of vegas,1
"Always love Gordon Ramsay’s shows; however, my boyfriend and I were very disappointed when we ate here - service lacked attentiveness, I felt like we were ignored AND our waiter never offered sides with my bf’s meal! My fish and chips were delicious; however, when I wanted more tarter sauce, it took longer than it should have! I get better service locally here in Carpinteria, Ca. Sorry Chef Ramsay! Viv is very disappointed!",3
Friendly service and great food. Do recommend greatly.,5
Very good food.,4
"I honestly thought it would be much better, I got the fish & chips not worth the price @ all. Fries were not fresh or seasoned, only thing I ate was 2 pieces of fish, I'm so sorry to give it a bad review I wish it was a good review.",1
Excellent Food Great Service,5
"The good is very good, but the prices are quite high.  If you want fish and chips, go across the street to Gordon Ramsay Fish and chips in the walkway to the Linq. As good, more fish, 1/2 the price.

11/21  . Follow up, in retrospect, my review was unfair at 3 stars.  In fact, this was a return trip because it was so good last time.  It was just as good this time.  What I should have said was more along the lines of ""if you want a similar fish and chip experience at a lower cost"" give the fish and chip shop across the street a try.  Actually both are quite good and done if the best fish and chips I have had anywhere.  My apologies and I have updated my review to 5 stars after rethinking.  Not a cop out, basically what it should have been in the first place.  So thank you for your follow up but it was not meant to be a negative review.  I will definitely be eating at one or both next time I'm in Vegas and have recommended both to others several times in the last few weeks",5
Fantastic dinner and expert service.,5
"The overall a great meal, best mashed potatoes I've ever had",5
"Food was great as expected but what really made this place was the service. Staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome even though we brought our toddler at night. Kept doing things without us even asking to cater to our one year old.I think our waiters name was Ali but other staff were also kind and friendly. Definitely worth a visit if looking for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant to visit or good food while in Vegas. The Shepard's pie, beef Wellington and mac and cheese were all delicious! Best mac and cheese we have ever had!",5
Horribly over priced and we did not get service for basic water for over 10 minutes. This was after waiting for 1 hr to get table. Avoid at all cost.,1
Very good food and service was quick.,5
"Highly recommend, will return. Thank you",5
Food was great as always. Could not get in at Hell's Kitchen so tried this spot again. 3- course dinner was great value and as always delicious-same as Hell's Kitchen. Would definitely eat there again!,5
"Try the beef wellington, their specialty",5
Shame on the Fish and chips... shame on Baby plastic forks to go :((((,1
"By far the best restaurant I have been to. The happy noises I made while consuming my hundred dollar beef Wellington made it worth every penny. Best meal, service, and city!",5
Mr. Ramsey I’m not sure how your cooks made a wedge salad taste phenomenal but mission accomplished. Also the misses knows the amount of no hømø man crush i have when I’m over here using surnames. F’ing bloody he||.,5
"Salad - it's not a piece of cabbage.
FY Gordon Ramsay.",1
Overpriced and underwhelming food. I ordered the steak and ale pie which came with a tiny side of raw vegetables in an otherwise empty plate. The pie itself tasted fine but for pub food it was way overpriced. Service was good and about what is expected from any good restaurant. If you like Gordon Ramsay and want to be able to say that you went to one of his restaurants you will probably like it. If you want great food or good value then look elsewhere.,2
"The atmosphere was pretty great. It was my first time eating here and while it was enjoyable, it’s just didn’t match my idea of the quality that would be produced in a place owned by Gordon Ramsay.

Our waitress was friendly and regularly checked on our party.

I ordered the Vegetarian Pie (a veg version of shepherds pie) and let me tell you, the taste is out of sight. There was a moment when I seriously considered crawling inside of it and taking a nap.

However, that dissipated in short time. The VP was so flavorful and hearty but the challenge was instead of being layered, like shepherds pie, the vegetables were super finely chopped and mixed into the lentil base. And there was a lot of the lentil base. It was just too much of the same flavor profile and mushy-like consistency. The potatoes on top, were perfect as was the small side salad that came with the meal. That side salad was the best thing I ate on my entire trip.

All-in-all, it was good and I would definitely give this restaurant another go if it has more vegetarian options.",4
"Wow! Our server, Elyse M. was outstanding! She is probably the best server I've ever encountered. The food was amazing! My wife has been wanting to try beef Wellington for years. It was not a disappointment. The Sticky Toffee pudding is out of this world. We will definitely be back the next time we travel to Vegas.",5
"Cocktails were excellent, truffle fries were soggy and too oily.",3
"One word, Overrated. I tried to enjoy but it was just plain. Not worth the price, you are paying for the name.",2
Great food.,5
Total RIP off.   Served mashed peas/baby food with the fish.,1
Great service at the bar and probably the best burger I've ever had. Perfectly cooked and not overly seasoned. My first time here but I'll definitely be back.,5
Nice place. Food was delicious..,4
"Loved this place, food and service was amazing!",5
No takeout/ to go on the weekend and when ever they are busy.,1
Burger was amazing. So we're the nachos,5
The food was alright. Prices are typical Casino/Vegas high. Restaurant staff was great and even with covid-19 precautions in place the atmosphere was good.,4
Most amazing steak deff worth the try! It was so juicy and full of flavor but in the most simple way!,5
"It was somewhat okay. Not really worth the price, expected something more due to being a fan of Gordon Ramsay... but now I’m not sure about wanting to be a fan of Gordon Ramsay anymore. Kind of disappointing. Save your money.",1
"My husband and I were in Vegas for a few days. Really wanted to eat at Gordan Ramsey reataurant. I am a bit on the cheap side but my husband insisted to eat there. He ordered the lobster shrimp roll with truffle fries which he thought was outstanding.  I ordered the deviled eggs, which to the least unfortunately we're terrible. My local grocery store is better.  They are smaller than medium eggs, dry like they were made a week ago and barely had any taste. I really wanted to love it. Service was great though.",3
Best burgers ever,5
"The service was excellent. The drinks were good. The food was mediocre. If you’re expecting a traditional steak and ale pie, this is not the place to get it. We ordered the steak and ale pie imagining the wonderful ones that we have had in England and Scotland. Instead, we received essentially a pot pie. It was full of fillers, as opposed to just meat (and sometimes mushrooms) as they are prepared in England. Instead of a flaky top, it had a rather uninspiring doughy top. The gravy was disappointing too. We also got the lobster mac n cheese. It was very average for the $25 price tag.",3
The food was excellent service was ok.,5
Best hamburger and shrimp cocktail we have ever had!! Yaneisy gave us wonderful service.,5
Awesome food... loved the hospitality,5
Husband's hamburger not well done. Next burger was with bacon. Not what he ordered. Other than that. A lot of good food and service,4
"Unfortunately, my family and I had the worst service ever and the food presentation was horrible. Expected more for the price and the name.",1
Best burger I've ever had.,5
"A pricey spin off of Hells Kitchen. The standard fare of burgers & steaks in a sports themed informal dining experience. Filets top off at nearly $50. apiece.  Salad @ $6. , asparagus around $13. & wine about $15. a glass. The food is delicious,  service about average.  Reservations are suggested. As one can add the above, expect to drop $100-$200 per couple,(as was our case).",3
"If you like overpriced average quality food, Ramsay Pub & Grill is the place to be. Even the fries are not home made, I'm pretty sure that they buy their fries at McDonald's. I would recommend Old English Pub at Area instead, same price level but 10 times better burgers.",1
"The server was rude, the burger was average, my girlfriend got the fish and chips and got sick afterwards. I would not go back.",1
Good finger food friendly employees very clean 100% sanitary,5
Excellent service great food and atmosphere,5
"I'm a Gordon Ramsay fan and was ecstatic to finally eat at one of his restaurants. Ordered appetizers, hot wings & calamari and 2 beers, $80.00 The beer and sauces were great but the food itself was not. The wings were over cooked and the calamari was lukewarm and greasy. Disappointing experience after seeing his shows and the high standards he has for food preparation. I wonder if he surprises the chefs at his restaurants like 24 hours to hell and back when they don't know he's there to critique them.",2
Beef Wellington out of this world.,5
"Amazing service.  We had a large group of 11. Alexander was super helpful and patient with all of us.  He could work with each guest and personalize to each of them. Then there was the food.  Came out fantastic.  Delicious.  Everyone of us enjoyed our meal.
Thank you so much. Absolutely wonderful.",5
Great food and friendly staff,5
The chefs here exceeded all expectations. Bravo!,5
Simply fantastic service and good food. No complaints.,5
Absolutely wonderful experience!! Service was awesome and food was cooked to perfection!!!! Only disappointment was not getting to meet Chef Ramsey,5
"I expected better quality food.  The prime rib was not a good cut and probably the  toughest one I've ever eaten.  Like every other place in Vegas, it's packed and loud.  Impossible to carry on a conversation at normal volume.  Good selection of beer.  No wine.  There are too many good places in Vegas that offer a better dining experience.  I won't waste money here again.  2 Stars - Service was great.",2
"Went for dinner was not with any kids but is not kid friendly for dinner. An hour wait even though there was not many people in there, COVID I guess? We were so hungry the nachos were good. The water glass tasted dirty and had BIG expectations since duh Gordon Ramsay but it was not good I had the crispy chicken and it just tasted greasy I only ate not even half cause I was starving and it was freaking pricey which I wouldn’t care if it would have been the best chicken ever which it was not Popeyes is better! I spent 42$ just for the chicken nothing else which is wild considering it was gross. On top of all of that the waiter looked annoyed and took FOREVER to come and go. I will not be going back and telling people to not go there maybe his other restaurants there are better?",1
The Beef Wellington was delicious 👍🏿👍🏿,5
This was the best food I have ever eaten! Great service I will be back!,5
Unbelievable Pub Burger.,5
It was a dream destination in Las Vegas. The food tastes like good British pub snacks.,5
Oh my!  What an awesome place to eat. We are locals and we've tried a lot of restaurants in town and this is one of the BEST!  We will definitely come back. Lots of menu choices. All prepared to Gordon's high standards. BRAVO!,5
Overall good experience with great food.,4
Great food Excellent service,4
Great bar food and excellent staff,5
Good food and professional waiters here made for a pleasant dinner,4
"My boyfriend at the time and I were there about 6 months to a year ago, i know its it's a late review but it was very disappointing. The steak tasted like the grill or burnt, and the shepherd's pie was very salty. We weren't very greedy or educated on fine dining so we didnt send it back, but we should have. The lobster roll was very good, like nothing I'd ever had. Definitely recommend the lobster roll, even if seafood isnt your thing.
Service was good, although we were sat in an empty section, instead of near the kitchen or other tables where we could've experienced the full dining experience. The gentleman serving us didnt ask if we wanted to send anything back, even though we complained about the shepherd's pie.",2
"I came here every night while I was at Caesars. I sat at the bar and had such a great time, Keith, the bartender, was entertaining, funny and genuine. I love a good Hefeweizen and they have it on draft. The Shrimp Cocktail is so delicious and the Wedge Salad is wonderful as well. I also had the Bacon Burger which was awesome, but the best part was the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was free after checking in with Yelp! You won't be disappointed!",4
Great service and excellent customer service!,5
The Rib-eye was perfect and so was everything else,5
Short ribs amazing,5
Great lunch made even better by 5 star service,5
The wellington was a bit dry. We had to wait for all reservation party to arrive and waited at the side. How rude,4
"My wife and I are huge Gordon Ramsay fans and felt it our duty to eat here while visiting Las Vegas. I ate the beef wellington and my wife ate the scallops. These two dishes and two pints of beer were $150. The food was good, but the flavor portion did not come close to warranting the price. The portions were scant (5 scallops came on her plate that was close to $50), and the vegetables that came with the wellington were a very small portion. There are other cheaper places to eat in Las Vegas that will provide you with this level of flavor and satisfaction.",3
"Limited menu for dinner and very pricy. Food was excellent. We had the nachos and the lobster rolls off the appetizer side. No burgers during dinner, have to go at lunch for that. Had some pricy salads, steaks and soups. The 3 course dinner was 75.00. 3 stars due to limited menu and pricy.",3
Burger was dry and tasted old (cold) & wings were hard as a rock. Couple of Margaritas were excellent. As far as experience I feel it was awful because of premium prices for mediocre food.,1
"I have never in my life had such phenomenally tender and flavorful short ribs. My dinner companions similarly raved about their meals. Service was timely and attentive without being intrusive.

Ignore the flashing lights and the glittering signs advertising various shows. Come and eat here, and come hungry. The real show is on your plate.",5
Food was great!!! Service was great!,5
"This location is nice and quiet. It's tucked in a back corner of Ceasars Palace in Las Vegas. It was a bit of a walk from the front door, just behind the atlantis show. The service was very good. The food was very good. The only thing we didn't like,  which made me ding them one star, was that they didn't allow us to reserve a table for our friends who were walking towards the restaurant. They had to arrive, stay in line, and wait 20 minutes to be seated when they could have avoided the wait time.",4
"Brook and Jessica did an amazing job attending my family of 9!! The customer service was outstanding!! They were amazing!! I'm absolutely recommending this location. The food was delicious, the drinks were the most flavorful! ufff I just love this location because they make us feel welcome and above all like family!",5
"Great food at reasonable prices for Las Vegas. The menu is huge, you could spend a couple of hours reading it all before choosing. Good thing all I've tasted there is great, so if you leave it to chance you won't be diasapointed. Except for the onion soup, but I don't think many people have ordered that besides me.",5
"An excellent breakfast place. The food was terrific, and Chris M was very helpful and kind.
The Belgian waffle was warm, fluffy, and perfect. The butter sauce is sweet and delicious.
The Tai lettuce wrap was sweet and spicy and full of zing.
The breakfast plates are just heavenly and full of flavor.
Masks are required to enter, and face shields are encouraged but are not mandatory.
They have limited capacity, so make sure to go outside of peak times and be ready to wait in line.",5
They had a 45 minute wait. Then they eventually texted us but they were so busy that they forgot to seat us. They kept seating other people. Why text if you don't have the table yet? The service once at the table was excellent but the front desk should get more training.,3
My first time to the Cheesecake Factory was a good experience. The food was good. The Cheesecake was amazing! The restaurant was very nice decor. The staff took good care of us. The prices were reasonable. I would go back again. Even if it is only for Cheesecake!,4
"It was great, portion sizes, ambiance, hostesses, and facility. However, wait time was atrocious and it was a little smaller than the other units we've been to.",5
"Great place! Always stop by when in Vegas. Awesome staff, made every effort to find us a table quick eventhough the place was full. No wait time. Ribeye steak was good, wheat bread tastes great, the flat bread pizza was a little salty. Highly recommend this place.",5
"I wrote a review for a different Cheesecake Factory restaurant yesterday where the experience was pretty bad. This restaurant on the other hand provided one of the best dining experiences we have had. The restaurant is clean and well maintained. We had a short wait, but less than what they told us to expect. Our waitress was fantastic. She was friendly, courteous and very attentive. Our glasses were never empty and the food was delicious. They should have the manager from this restaurant go out and provide training to the restaurant in Summerline.",5
My parents just got remarried so we all decided to go here at it was fantastic I never even thought of having a cheese filled burger! Thanks Cheese Cake Factory.,5
Juan was the best writer of all time.  Respectful and timely.  Very personable.   I wish more waiters were like him!,5
"One of the best experiences during our stay in Vegas. Our server, Ethan was so kind...very humble and over all very sweet! And of course the food was great!

It's such a pleasure when customer care is genuinely displayed. Thanks, ETHAN😎",5
Oh so tasty!  I got a past that was called something like Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Then I got a delicious cheesecake.  Can’t remember the flavor I got.  The restaurant is super cool and its right by the Caesar’s Fountain.  Super fun.,5
"December 2021 Review- So we had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory and everything was great - food & service - until we paid our check. We asked for a credit card terminal to pay at the table.  Our server said that their payment system was archaic and she would just take my credit card around the corner to process the payment and if I wanted to, I could go with her. I declined to go and nothing further regarding this was discussed with our server. When she came back she actually threw the receipt, credit card and pen on the table and stormed away. We were shocked at this behaviour, it was certainly uncalled for, we were never rude nor suggested anything that would warrant this rudeness. In Canada, every restaurant has credit card payment terminals that are brought to your table when you are ready to pay. This type of credit card payment processing at the Cheesecake Factory is very outdated and with credit card skimming still rampant in the USA, should be updated sooner than later. Plus using a credit card is preferable to handling cash during this Covid-19 crisis.
**This was such a disappointing experience at one of our favourite restaurants.  It wrecked what was otherwise an enjoyable lunch.**

November 2021 Review - Love The CheeseCake Factory!  Always eat at this location when we’re in Vegas. Seated at a great table on the patio, outside the main dining area, great for people watching and looking at the aquarium. The menu is so vast, it’s hard to choose what to eat. Everything is so delicious. This time we had appetizers-the best Southern fried chicken sliders, fries, crispy crab wontons and the egg roll sampler plate. Everything was done perfectly. Highly recommend!",2
"The food at this location is generally very good and the service for dine in is very good. The 2 star review is aimed at the take out service. This part has sadly declined. After waiting for more than 10 mins on hold I walked to the counter to place my order. Nobody was in line and the counter help was just waiting to say hello. I saw the phone line flashing and asked if your phones were working? Was told oops. The last several times I’ve ordered a bowl of soup with comes in two containers, one would be a cup. If you don’t check you will receive one cup instead of two. My coworkers have also complained.  I want to see next week if the same mistakes are made. Hopefully this part of the business can improve.",2
This one in particular was a favorite because of the beautiful Aquarium views surrounding the outside sitting area.,5
"We came for the Sunday brunch and ordered chicken with Benedict eggs over waffles, pepperoni pizza bread, french toast and chilaquiles with carnitas. Congrats to Victoria, our waiter. A very nice person with a delicate service and great attitude.
Our ranking was:
1.- French toast. Simply amazing. It is soft and baked perfectly. The best.
2.- Pepperoni pizza bread. Also a very good dish. The ingredients have a great quality to make an amazing pizza slice.
3.- Chilaquiles with carnitas. Good dish but not the best. It is very well served, but I guess that as Mexicans, we are used to have way better chilaquiles.
4.- Chicken with Benedict eggs. The eggs and waffles were perfect. A ver original dish, but the potatoes were over cooked and I left them.
We will surely return. A nice place.",4
One of our favorite places to eat everywhere we travel. Delicious food and drinks. This one in particular was a favorite because of the beautiful Aquarium views surrounding the outside sitting area. We always receive great customer service.,5
If you don't mind a long wait you will enjoy the atmosphere and the staff. Food is great and I do have to recommend either the jambalaya pasta or the fish tacos. Make sure you get them tempora Style. They are amazing and very filling.,5
"Lighting was a little dim, but atmosphere was nice! Our server was great, friendly, kind, and made sure that we were taken care of. Food was fresh and tasted amazing. Portion sizes were larger than we expected and there was more than enough left over to take home for another meal! Safety measures were in place and we felt very comfortable eating here. Will definitely come back!",5
"Very odd reservation system, has to be done online via Yelp. Food was great, service a little slow, but good. And fantastic cheesecakes, nom, nom, nom.",5
"Great food and compared to the cost of any other meal in Vegas, this is the best value meal you can get.",5
"A couple of my friends, sister and I were staying at Caesars palace this past week and one of the days decided to have the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. It was about 5-10 minute walk from our room and from experience we knew that had great portion sizes.

We walked up at lunch and were seated right away. The hostess was very kind as was our waitress who did a terrific job. We ate on the patio area of the restaurant that’s in the mall and it was a great view that really made the meal all that much better.

My sister and I split a salmon lunch entree and spaghetti and while it didn’t look that big I must say that it filled me up well. Especially considering the fantastic black bread that came before and during the meal.

For dessert my sister and I ended up splitting an Oreo cheesecake which honestly let me down a little. Wasn’t as thick as their other cheesecakes, but still good. Definitely would have went with something else for the dessert, but still happy with it overall.",4
"Food was ok. Didnt get the usual bread basket and even asked but they were out. People who came when we finished got bread. Thats one of our favourite parts. Service was lacking lustre and didnt feel like we were really paid much attention. Womens washroom also lacked for attention,  ran out of TP in all stalls. Someone pried cupboard open to grab some.",2
Cheese cake factory.. right everyone has dessert in mind! Well the dessert is all that is good in my opinion other than their mac n cheese ball appetizer. If you do eat here get that for sure! The entrees are lack luster for the cost is the reason for my 4 star!! But honestly it's the dessert that matters!,4
Very expressive but very lovely out here. I would love to come back and visit,5
Very tasty food! The red velvet cheesecake was bomb!,5
Server was great food delicious cost was extremely high but its vegas and off the strip.,4
Had a little bit of a weight. And took awhile to find. Other than that I got good food. And a delicious Key Lime pie Martini. (Oh yes I did taste like pie). And yes I was high. It's Vegas Baby!!!,4
"My strawberry daiquiri & the steak with fettuccine alfredo sauce were 🙌, take me back please. Downside, wait time, very busy, it is understandable why the long wait, but they make up for it big time with their delicious food & drinks. Low-medium prices.",4
"The food was very good and the cheesecake is amazing, it's the best I've ever had!",5
Great selection great food,5
Great place for deserts. Service was great too,5
"We love to visit the Cheesecake Factory when in Vegas.  The food is excellent, the service is great, the people are wonderful, and they're usually pretty knowledgeable on food allergies but not this time.  I ordered a gluten-free cheesecake, asked twice if it was gluten-free and was told it was.  I took it home to my wife who has Celiac's disease.  She noticed right away that the cocoa powder was left on the cheesecake (it has gluten), removed it, and enjoyed the cheesecake.  If you have food allergies, be very careful here.",3
"I went here on 9/15 for dinner - around 9PM. I sat at the bar and ordered a filet mignon (medium-rare) with a side of spinach and sweet potato fries, I also had a lemon drop martini. My steak was perfectly cooked, came out quickly, and the sides were fresh and delicious. Service was perfect, I left full and happy. Highly reccomend.",5
First time there food was great!  got the ny steak and chicken Farfalle. Fair price for 2 meals and drinks main thing is the scenery 👌,5
Delicious. Try the Sheppard’s pie,5
Very good food excellent customer service I've ate there twice the 4 days I was there,4
The good is excellent. The staff is very nice.,5
The service has really slowed down when they’re not busy. Ribeye steak. don’t order it. Club sandwich was good. Fries were sent to the table cold. This is not the way it used to be. Will not stop again.,3
A great experience.  Well never do it Christmas again though.,4
Ate at the bar. Great staff and food.,5
"To start, the reservation time that I made at 7:30 was moved up to 7 and I did not know. Luckily we were still seated quickly. The water was good, wasnt tap like other restaurants.  Waiter was helpful, didnt like the house salad. The dressing was too garlicky,  bold garlic taste. Her trio was greasy,  my steak diane was medium but needed more flavor. Mashed potatoes were amazing. The waiter brought out a sundae for my wife's birthday, he said they couldn't sing anymore so we sang her happy birthday.  The best part about it was the cheesecake.",3
One of my favorite Cheesecake Factories! Great food and service!,5
Great food and service!  Waitress and rest of staff were an absolute pleasure!  Will be back when I come back to Vegas!  😁,5
A little expensive. Visit Oct 2021. Nice ambient,3
Some of the friendliest servers I've experienced in my numerous trips to Vegas. The food was amazing and much more affordable than some of the other options.,5
The smokehouse bbq burger was the bomb! They were very busy but the waitress and waiter were very accommodating!,5
"Had the skinny shrimp tacos which were ok, the cabbage salad on the side was very good. Loved the bread they brought to the table. The burrito was huge and looked good, but alot of rice in it.",4
"We celebrated a special night for my Daughter on December 17th , her 13th birthday dinner. Little did she know the gift was not just her favorite restaurant it was also a Bruno Mars concert afterwards. The waiter was great, he was a really cool guy. I let him know were in a little time crunch and he got our orders out right away. The food was delicious as well.",5
"The wait staff may have been having a tough day but the food was delicious! Ordered the fried calamari that was yummy. And the rib eye, nicely seasoned with green beans and mashed potatoes. Perfectly cook to medium with a dark red wine. For dessert, their signature raspberry swirl white chocolate cheesecake, a sharing portion.",4
"Our family enjoyed our meal at the Cheesecake Factory! It was one of the best locations that we have ate at. My father said that his burger was one of the best that he has ever had. All of the meals were good, and the service was also good. The prices were really good and were still on par with locations in less expensive areas. Our only complaint is that the hostesses were all VERY rude. They almost refused to give us a paper menu, twice! Besides the rude hostesses, the meal was great and moderately priced for a sit down meal on the Strip.",5
"As I learned from what I was told, the first link of the chain is located in the Ceasar shopping center.  They provide service both inside and in the front area.  The place is very luxurious and the services are nice.  Cheesecake is presented with its calories.  taste and calorie calculation is your choice",5
Best keylime and coffee treat.,5
"Service 5 stars, food not typical 5 stars (what I've eaten at other GCFs). Stunning location 👌.  Amazing aquarium and great shopping available while you wait for a table",4
Always one of my favs Bellagio yummy,5
The waffle and chocolate cake were very good 😊.,4
"This is a fantastic restaurant. My wife and I love to come here. The food here is flaverful and delicious! You always get a large portion and sometimes there's enough to take home. Their bread, their bread is absolutely amazing! It always comes out warm, soft and ready to eat. The service is great we were well taken care of. I think the pricing is fine for the quality and quantity of food you receive. My wife had the New York steak and I had the Smokehouse BBQ burger. it was one of the juices and most delicious burgers I've ever had.",5
Excellent food and customer service.,5
"We had issues with our food (not made correctly and undercooked).  I was not going to complain but the waiter (Cody) made the effort to send the manager to our table, and she covered the entire check!!  Thank you Cody.  Normally the Cheesecake Factory is perfect every time.  Unfortunately this was not one of those times, but they made it right.",3
"We never learn. No matter how many times we eat at the Cheesecake factory, we forget the portions are massive. Or we just cannot resist temptation.

The menu is a lot to process at first. This time, we got the kid sliders, avocado toast and the original burger with salad.

All of it was great. I usually never get burgers at restaurants but the original burger (done medium rare) really hit the spot.

For dessert, we got two cheesecakes: tiramisu and upside down pineapple cake. Both were great! And the same could be said about the service.

We finished our meal just in time to catch the hourly Atlantis show as well.",5
"Best cheesecake in the world!
If you like lemonade, please order their strawberry lemonade and you will love it!",5
Jamaican Shrimp! Very good. Mango lime cheese cake. Nice and light. Very quick service.,5
"The service here was absolutely  horrible. Waitress never brought silverware, never checked in, never brought drinks, never apologized for poor service. She hated her job. She never offered dessert so we went to window and got it to go.
Food was good.",1
Freddy was an excellent server and the food was fantastic! Highly recommend the cucumber lemonade!,5
"I love this restaurant. The food over there is really delicious, and they have so many choices. And I love the bread there. This is a really good place for having dinner with family or friends. And their cheesecakes are amazing",5
Cheesecake factory never disappoints. I got raspberry and lime for the first time. It was so good.,5
The vanilla bean cheesecake was recommended to me by a gentleman working the information desk at Caesars. He did not misinform me.,5
"My husband and i went here for lunch and we had a great experience!! Our server Joseph was so attentive and friendly, its hard to come by good servers now a days but he killed it! We will definitely come back!",5
"Highly recommended.
Best food and awesome service for your money and a great menu of choices if you are wanting to eat while at Ceasar's Palace! We eat there several times every visit and have never been disappointed!",5
Very awesome place! Noah's favorite Casino!,5
Amazing service delicious food reasonable priced.,5
"You just cannot go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Menu is so varied you can find a new option for every visit. This time it was chicken and shrimp gumbo, I can only say delicious. As always highly recommended.",5
I love this place. Something about me I like places I know about and this is one of them. The staff was great.,4
I had orange chicken it was tasty. And low sugar strawberry cheese cake was great!,1
"This is the pinnacle of all cheesecake factories I've been to. Service is the best, food is the freshest, but also the wait times can be the longest. I also go there, put my name in, then shop around the mall for an hour or two. If you can do a reservation I'd highly recommend it. But having the restaurant right next to the statue/animatronics show inside the forum shops is such a fun experience.",5
If you haven't been to the Cheesecake factory lately you better get going!  These guys are awesome!  There menu is like a book! So many choices! The food and service is always so good! And it's not so expensive that it breaks the bank! Get on down to the Cheesecake Factory and get your Cheesecake on!!,5
Had a great time food good.,5
"The waiter that helped us Alex, was the best. I think he needs to be thanked for his wonderful service.",5
"Service was good but expect to pay about $80 for what you see in this photo, plus 2 drinks. Look how thin this ribeyphoto🤭",2
"Awesome 🥳
Good food quality and very good service.
Will come back definitely when we visit Las Vegas next time.",5
"Food was average, service was also average, uninterested and not overly keen on engaging with the customer. Feel the overall experience has dropped in CCF. Would now think twice about revisiting.",3
How I missed dine-in so much! CDC guidelines still suggests mandatory face masks to be worn if you're not planning on dining in.,5
"I came to Vegas for a couple days, flew in on Wednesday from Michigan,  and it was my first time there in the city, my friends and I came to the restaurant Friday and our waitress Melissa was very polite and helpful.. especially with the recommendations. We were all happy with her recommendations and they were very delicious.. I made sure that not only I, but my friends took care of her, she deserved it. Thank you so much Melissa for a wonderful experience at your restaurant. The next time I am in Vegas by myself or even with friends I/we’ll make sure to ask for you to take care of me/us the next I’m/we’re there. Five stars across the board for you Melissa. Thank you so much. Stay safe",5
Great dinner. Chicken Piccata was delicious and Godiva Cheesecake was excellent as well.,5
First time at this location.   Minimal wait time.  Pasta DaVinci and gumbo were both excellent and large in portion size.,5
Good food. Everybody loves the cheesecake. It's a little bit pricey but still okay,4
At first I wasn't sure how I felt with no having a physical menu to look at but it's actually really simple with the phone. Everyone was very helpful and quick. I was really impressed with our waiter as he was on top of everything even though they were swamped with people at the time we went for dinner. The food was delicious and the cheesecake was heavenly. I definitely recommend this location.,5
"We love the cheesescake factory and actually forgot this one was inside Caesars Palace because it it located at the very back. We sat at the bar for timesake and the barmaid was very attentive and ran the bar like a well oiled machine and took orders from all the patrons. The food was delicious as always. Shrimp Alfredo for me and Steak, potatoes and green beans for my hubby. Restaurant was very clean and most patrons wore mask except when eating. Very enjoyable and pleasant atmosphere.",5
"Great great service the bartender had great customer service and the personality to match.
Thanks Christian for great service with a smile consistently with everyone that came to the bar.",5
Excellent service 😃 👍🎉 and delicious food!! The prices are not bad for Las Vegas.,5
$10.00 and this what you paid for... They didn't give you enough marinara sauce... So sad 😭,2
"Cheesecake Factory is so consistent, with delightful staff. It is such a pleasure to eat there, and the cheesecake keeps well for late night munchies.",5
We made reservations a month or two in advance of our vacation. I'm glad we did as there was a line waiting for tables. We were seated right away and the waiter was amazing. I tipped him well for his suggestions and kindness.,5
"All I want to say is wow. I’ve come here several times with my family and I’ve never had such a good experience as I did this past time we went
solely because of our server TRAYLE! There was a long wait to get seated, and the minute we get seated she approaches us and was very friendly and considerate of the kids. We’ve never had a server be so considerate of our children before. She was quick to take our order and gave us some new suggestions of things you could try that were all delicious!
She was sweet, considerate, and caring and even sang my youngest daughter happy birthday which we all appreciated. My daughter kept complimenting her hair too haha. Thank you Trayle for making this such an amazing experience for me and my family we’re definitely going to come back and see her again soon!",5
Rude  and slow wait staff.  Usually great service and friendly.  Not at this one.  The waiter never checked on us and took forever to bring back what we asked for.  The french fries were cold and the burger was overdone and super salty.  The only good thing of the meal was the pretzel bites and cheese as the appetizer.  Was not impressed.,3
"Deemed one of my absolute favorite places for any and every type of food you can imagine!! The location in Ceasars Palace in Las Vegas was beautiful! 2 floors, right in front of the new aquarium and you can see the Atlantis Show while you wait! I love their appetizers, as well as the cheesecake MENU 😁👍🏼 I am always pleased by the staff, at any and all locations I have ever been to and I highly recommend them to anyone!",5
"Fantastic place. One of the best if not the best hamburger I ever had. Suggest to try the American burger. And the desert, just superb if you like cheese cake, but hey, what else can be in restaurant named Cheesecake factory.
And 🍒 on the top. The staff so friendly and professional, was a pleasure to be here. Sure will come back.",5
"Great food & big menu to choose from
They are a little short on staff, so the wait for a table a bit longer than usual",4
How could I rate this any lower than a 5. The food is wonderful and the service is beyond reproach.,5
Nice Gelato shop in Ceasars close to Aquarium & nike store. Lots of options & liked u could pick multiple flavors & they allowed sampling,5
"One word, delicious! The bread... So soft warm and yummy! The cheesecakes are out of this world!",5
"Had a great dinner for my boyfriend's birthday, the appetizer got lost in translation lol but all in all it was a good meal and a beautiful location",5
"I never heard of getting a highball glass for a mojito simply because I requested less ice. For $15, I expected a conventional tall bar glass. Other than that, the scenery was beautiful.",4
"Located inside Caesars Palace Casino. Surrounded by shopping and offer patio (lol) seating as well. Place stays very busy and expect some wait .. not too long however. Fantastic food, service and taste. Plenty of options for all dietary needs.",4
"Always love coming to the cheese cake factory; especially here at Caesars palace in Las Vegas. Although their is usually a wait, the setting outside the restaurant with the giant fish tank and Atlantis show make the time for faster!
Once inside, the restaurant offers a touch of luxury to everyone who enters. The waiters are very knowledgeable in what they are offering and offer 5 str service to everyone.
The food is always exceptional. We ordered the bacon bacon burger and the lemon salmon. Both meals cooked to perfection.
As much as we wanted desert, the food was to filling so had to give the cheese cakes a miss on this occasion. But from past experiences the deserts are always perfect as well and offer a lot of flavour for the portion size you get.

Will always return to the cheese cake factory when ever I’m back in Las Vegas!",5
"Sat at the bar. Had great service, food and drinks. Highly recommend",5
"An absolute dynamite menu! We had a great dinner with our party of 5. However, it would have been nice if the food runner had told me that the plates were hot! Burned my fingers!",5
You can't go wrong with cheesecake. I dare you to argue about it!! Coffee and cheesecake...,5
Had a reservation for dinner before a concert. Got in on time. Service and meal were both excellent as always with the Cheesecake Factory. Would recommend in a heartbeat.,5
"The cheesecake was excellent, and Carmela was absolutely fantastic.
We were taking a little break from our day and she was the highlight of it.",5
Cesears Palace Vegas location. Excellent service with the always dependable food and huge variety. 5 stars!,5
"The waiting on the reservation process took a while but one in, our group had 2 tables quickly. Service was outstanding. Typical CF menu. I tried the fish and chips. Wasnt bad.",4
We prefer cheesecake factory at the caesars forum shops. We usually eat at the bar but when we sit at a table we request Bryan.  Food is good and reasonably priced and the wine is a good pour. The portions are large enough to share. Bread basket is a real plus and the butter is real butter. Thank you for a wonder experience.,5
"Delicious food, and an amazing venue. Our waiter was also amazing, and did something special for my daughter's birthday. I had the chicken and biscuits, and chased it down with key lime cheesecake. You know when the food is good when you're already full, and you still order desert because you know you're going to get another amazing food product from this restaurant. Definite of achieving a 👍👍👍 of my personal stamp of approval! Will visit again when in the area!",5
Food is so good and service is good!,5
Great Atlantis Show directly in front of the restaurant.  Very extensive menu and many varieties of cheesecake deserts.,5
"Overall great experience. There was a big wait time but we got ourself on the waitlist and managed to watch a kids show right next to the restaurant and that helped kill some time. We were a large party of 12 and were comfortably seated. The drinks, the food and the desserts were all just ok. If you have never been to a cheese cake factory, then you should try it for sure.",4
"Always a great experience.
Our server, Carmella was very friendly and attentive.",4
Awesome food love them Door dash been great but all there food is Awesome very tasty,5
My favorite Cheesecake Factory restaurant so far.  I have been in several across US.  Decor make sense in this place (at Cesar's Palacee) behind the aquarium.,5
1st Place I Went. If you want Great food And Service.Go Please. My Aunt's Birthday Monday was Great . Thanks Cheesecake Factory. They catered even though a Full House.👍❤,5
Food was great. Service was fantastic. Cool location near the Apple Store and Nike.,5
We had to wait for 45 min to get seat for dinner. In the mean time enjoyed the Atlantis show. Service very good. Food quality overrated. pricing is average ~ @ $20 each dish.,4
Don't forget to stop for a rest and some yummy desserts. My little Penny needed a good nap after shopping.,5
Banana Cream Cheesecake hit the spot,5
Enjoyed my favorite Shrimp Scampi and Upside Down Pineapple cheesecake. Always a win with either a Strawberry or Raspberry lemonade.,5
It took one hour to be seated and another hour for your food to arrive. Waitress barely come to check up on you but yet they rush you to leave. They were out of black beans so they had add extra rice on my plate without even letting me know. And the food was just to greasy/oily.,2
The food was excellent...burgers and fries that put fast-food to shame and the service was top notch. 😋,5
"I have to say - you cannot go wrong with any of their plates, it’s really good and a fair price for what you get. But after after eating at many TCF this one is the one I like the least. The location within the mall is horrible - there is almost no way out. Nice if you happen to walk by, but plan an extra hour for getting there (an a table).",3
Very good food. I can't wait for the one at home to get finished.,5
"Maybe I was just unlucky but I got sick from my food, truffle honey chicken :(
The cheesecake was delicious and my husband's food was good! I have been at this location a few years back and the experience was great.",2
Great food and atmosphere located inside of The Caesar’s Palace.,5
It's the Cheesecake Factory. I'm from the Carolinas and love the one back home. I couldn't tell a difference. They have a good portion of the dining area for walk-ins. So reservations aren't required if this is a last minute thing. They told us the wait was 45 minutes we gave them our cell number. Walked around the Nike Store for about 15 minutes and our table was ready.,5
I ordered the Italian Trio and received something completely different and called the restaurant. They put me on hold for over 15 minutes until I had to go. Do not order delivery!,1
My first time and it was EVERYTHING I expected great food...,5
My food was okay. My steak was burnt but my chicken was cooked just right.,2
"Unfortunately this was the worst experience I have had in a restaurant that I absolutely love. We booked reservations and waited quite a bit only to be seated under the stairs. The waitress was wonderful but clearly understaffed and they lost one of our meals, took quite a bit of time to offer water, and the food was not up to the typical Cheesecake Factory standards. The manager and waitress apologized and I would say they were doing their best. However, due to the crowd and staffing I'm not sure I'd come back on our next trip.",2
"The best cheese cake I ever had so far, even I made to-go, it is still tasted amazing. The Oreo dream extreme is my favorite cheese cake. Can't wait to visit here again.",5
"My family just had dinner here and always make it a point to eat at this location in the forum shop area when we are in town. We’ve never been disappointed until this time. The food was great as usual but unfortunately the experience was ruined once the waiter spilled a beer and drink and broke the glass all over the table and all over us. The new shoes I just bought in the forum shops are now broke in too soaked in beer. They cleaned everything around us instead of just moving us to a new table,  which there were plenty of open ones. The waiter made a bigger deal about telling us how he never spills things and all of his coworkers gave him a bad time over it. Yes I paid for the entire meal because the food was great as always and I didn’t even get charged extra for the broken glass and beer bath. I also went to the link today that the owner sends as a generic reply for bad reviews so they can discuss further. Of course no reply from my message to that link either.  Typical move to try and make it look like they take care of issues when they don’t.",1
Nesting nicely in back of Caesars Forum. Nice atmosphere almost classy. Staff are super nice and attentive. Love their variety of food i can never choose what I want even tho I know what I want already.  Love this place. Always come back to it.,5
"They do take reservations but you have to use Yelp to do it. Staff is great and so is the food. We actually went 2 times during our trip. Wife loved the skinnylicious chicken pot pie. Chicken riesling is very good. Comes with spaghetti noodle and changed to angel hair pasta the second time, much better this way.",5
"The only place I ever heard about the most before visiting The States was The Cheesecake Factory.

I don’t normally order dessert or cake cos I aent a sweet person but today I ordered and had a taste of the 3 different kinds.

Wow wow wow it is delish indeed.  Banana was my favourite and then The Tiramisu cheesecake.

The food and service here is really good and friendly.",5
"Waiters were extremely attentive, even with a lot of guests. They were also very accommodating to our custom orders and late joiners. Food was great as always",5
The quality of the food has been terrible the last few times we have been here. The presentation & huge portions both of which they are known for have fallen short.  Bread is burnt. Definitely not worth 20 bucks a plate. Thank you to the servers who are willing to work hard.,2
Excellent food and amazing customer service.   Server Dana was  very nice and fast and recommended items and made sure we liked them and making sure our food and drinks were refilled.  Kudos for Dana!!!!!!,5
Enjoyable for dinner. Maybe not the best value. There are other great options with superior food and drink for the same price.,3
The best tasting cheesecake factory food I've had!!!!...#PortionsOnPoint,5
"Was 👍🏽 great would defo go again .. will write more soon.
Soo a bit more info now. We had to wait about 10/15 mins to be seated but that was expected at the time. Once seated we let our server know that we were due for a show soon and wanted to be quick. Which she gratefully kept in mind and made sure our order was brought together and quickly. The food we ordered was delightfully tasty think we had some chipotle pasta without chicken (as I’m a vegetarian) and egg role ( name can’t fully remember ) which was also great! And highly recommend. The cheesecake was a salted caramel which was nice but would probably try something else another time.
All in all a great experience and tasty!!",5
Love the burgers and pastas. Calorie counted and clearly labelled on the menu.,5
There are better places to eat in Vegas than Cheesecake factory but if you're looking for a place with something for everyone at a fair price then this is definitely the place to go.,4
Always same quality and recurring visits  for pumping my blood sugar ;),4
"This wasn't it fam...the ✨multiple✨ hostess that were in the front were pretty dismissive and unfriendly, so that right away took away from the experience...the food itself didn't taste good, it was bland, it did not taste good...the only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because our waiter (who seemed to actually be the restaurant's bartender) was really friendly and gave awesome service 👍🏽 his back must be hurting from carrying that place smh anyway, if y'all in Vegas then go eat literally anywhere else 🤷🏽‍♀️",2
I have to admit being some what of a foodie I have never been to the Cheesecake factory  they're I said it.  However I decided to give it a go in LV. I GOT 2 MARGARITAS AND the egg roll sampler platter all the food was very good and the service was spot on.  I was told I needed to try the Cheesecake I passed on that however I will be back.,5
Heidi was great! Thank you for a great birthday evening.,5
Soooo much variety to choose from plus so many cheesecake choices at the end. Service has been awesome the past few times we went and quality and quantity for the price is amazing,4
Had the chicken Alfredo. It was great! My server Sharon was on point!! Added to a Great experience in Las Vegas,5
"Best Cheesecake Factory, ever. Jose was a great waiter!",4
"My waiter was nice but you can tell he was overwhelmed. He had to not only take orders but also buss down tables.  Our bread finally came out with our meal which took a while.  My favorite meal was out of stock, my favorite cheesecake was out of stock. I feel like i wasted my date night there and should have picked a different restaurant.",3
"At first, I thought I was there to eat some cheesecake, but nah, they have full course meals. I ordered a pizza, but they have plates from salads to meats. To my men, if you take her out here and pay in full, taking her to your place is a no biggie.",5
"Great experience.
The food was great. I had the bang bang chicken and shrimp.
I love the ambience.
I suggest making a reservation, as there is limited sitting available during this covid stuff.
Enjoy!",5
"Sat at the bar waiting for a table and when our table came open we were told we would have to stay at the bar since we had placed ( but not yet received) our order. Bar service was poor, no refill on ice tea and we sat there finished waiting to pay while the bartender was washing glassware.",2
"All four of us loved the food we ordered.  NY strip, truffle honey chicken, french dip burger, Chicken Madara.  Was 45 minute wait but worth it.",5
Amazing!! So delicious. Our waiter and Eric were so nice and accommodating.  Thank you for making our visit so memorable.,5
"wide choice of Amazing cheesacakes, but not only that!",4
"A land mark for me, a city is not checked out of my travel list unless it includes The Cheesecake Factory",5
"I can see why reviews have been lower... It's fine! Good place to eat but not great. Plus, over an hour wait time to get a table and around $20/person, walking out of there thinking hmm was this worth it??! 🤔 (Probably not!)",3
Its was okay only because the salad i ordered was delicious. The staff was just swamped with people !,3
"As always,  a great place to eat.",5
Service and food where both equally exceptional!! Hope to get back soon!,5
Oreo dream extreme cheesecake.,5
Amazing customer service experience! Our waitress was so helpful in helping me navigate a gluten and dairy free option for our lunch.,5
We had a good time! Just 4 stars though because the wait was so long and then it took a long time to get the check. But the food is good!,4
This place never disappoints its always satisfying,5
"The girl who deals with the reservations was sweet. The Food was amazing. No complaints there. My girlfriends daughter found 2 hairs in her food though. Black curly and distinctively thick. Most likely either a pube or beard hair. If I would have went into the kitchen and looked around I could have pointed out exactly who they belonged to. We showed the waitress who said ""that should never happen"" she took the hair supposedly to show a manager. Instead she came back like nothing happened and never mentioned it again. Iffy customer service at best. The picture included is just to show that we weren't just trying to get something for free.",1
I love they food but this location is over cooked everything,1
"Great place for lunch. Very unique appetizers like the spring roll platter. My favorite one is the avocado filling. Also got a chow mien noodle chicken salad, it is so refreshing with the tangy sauce. Great service, but it's a little dark in there.",4
"Jamaican brown rice and black beans
Plantain and brown rice.. and succotash...mmmm mmmm good!!😷😋",5
Good service but we had to wait more than half an hour for the food to arrive,4
Cheese cake was awesome. Be nice if they had lactose free cheese cake😒🤷 I was so sick after eating the cheese cake.. It was so good @ that time.. 😂,5
"We got a seat without waiting time. Their servings are more than sufficient for 1 person. The complimentary breads they serve with butter are tasty, especially the brown one.",5
Stayed at Caesars Palace and was happy to have the Cheesecake Factory to be part of the forum shops.  Made my order on line and walked over.  They were so crowded and I still had to wait but the food was delicious as usual.,5
First time eating there.. I ordered fried Shrimp and it was good the waitress was nice and the price of the meal was decent.,5
"Never been to a Cheesecake Factory till today in Las Vegas while being lost af in one of the hotel casinos. Anyways service there was great and clean place. Food was pretty good to I had the crispy pineapple chicken and boy was that good. My wife had the usual white girl meal and had a pasta shrimp. We ordered the nachos with avocado as a appetizer and my dude they did not hold back on the avocado (guacamole) gave us pretty much a big*** bowl of avocado. We had some chocolate fudge cake and it was good too I guess.  Anyways good place good food expensive as s**t
.",5
"New to Vegas and went for first date night...
Waited 20 minutes for a table..cool
Ordered appetizers...yum
Fire alarms going of repeatedly causing my PTSD to freak out and about passed out...
Ended up eating 2 pretzel bites and getting cheesecake to go...
Hopefully this is not the usual...",1
The absolute peak of food in Las Vegas in my opinion the food is immaculate without one flaw in the whole corse of the meal if you plan on coming to the amazing Caesars palace the cheese cake factory is the place that adds that golden layer of the Caesars palace experience highly recommend also get a salted caramel cheese cake TRUST ME 🤤,5
"From the waiter to the drinks everything was perfect.  Always a fun experience in Houston  Tx, the Cheesecake Factory in Las Vegas did not disappoint.  The Carneasada Steak was amazing and cooked just right.",5
"What a beautiful restaurant.
Service was perfect,  food excellent.
Try the pancakes 😋😁
Brandy was our server,  she was fantastic.  Thank you, Brandy",5
"Hubby and I were enjoying a date night without the kiddo after a long crazy week and decided we needed to eat at the one and only chain restaurant we absolutely adore - The Cheesecake Factory. It was a Tuesday night around 9:30p and there was a 40 minute wait. Between exploring nearby shops and good conversation the time passed quickly. We were sat at a table near the back on the first floor and our waiter was with us right away. He took awesome care of us all evening - some of the best service I've had at a Cheesecake Factory.

We recently learned how much we love their loaded Nachos. So we ordered them with the ""spicy"" chicken to share. For dessert, we tried to new chocolate coffee cheesecake and also the Godiva brownie sundae (one of our go-tos). The new Cheesecake had great flavor, but not quite the same texture as other cheesecakes.....it felt like it stuck to my mouth in different way. Overall it was good, but next time I think we'll go back to one of our favorites (Oreo or Reese's).

There's so much good food here! I know the menu can be over-whelming. I'm not much for their pizzas and I feel their burgers are just fine. I usually prefer a crazy Appetizer (any of the awesome egg rolls or fried Mac & cheese balls) or a salad if I want something light (Cobb or Greek).",5
"Huge portions, tasty food, nice service. We came here for lunch, got a burger for around 14usd. It was so big that I couldn't fit any cheesecake afterwards.",4
"The food is good and staff is very friendly, but it busy a lot.",4
"You really cannot go wrong with going to a cheesecake factory and this one was no exception. Our waiter was super friendly, the food was massive proportions and the view around the inside of ceasars palace was incredible.",4
Great food and very busy atmosphere.  Service was good even though restaurant was very busy.,4
I had there cheesecake and omg I am speachless,5
"Went here just for cheesecake, and the line was over an hour wait. I understand this is a busy location, but you would have thought by now they would have figured out how to handle the crowds.",1
I had a great experience wonderful waitress. And the salmon was delicious.,5
Good food and drinks and let's not forget the cheesecake. Yum yum,5
"Really good food and desserts,really nice waitresses,clean place ,good music i enjoyed dinning here",5
Amazing!,5
Was good.  Plate sat in the warmer window for a while and the noodles I had got hard. Cheesecake of course was amazing.,3
"Great food, large portions and great service.  The BBQ salad is fantastic.",5
"Love the food !!!
Always good",5
"Fantastic! We had the best service from Cody, our waiter, and we just had a great lunch. The food was great.",5
"I have been to this location twice and hope to go back again on my next Vegas visit! ACTUALLY, I did go a third time, technically... to pick up a salad I called in (Chinese Chicken). Soooo great!  They TRULY know how to prepare a steak with the level of PINK I enjoy! Service is fantastic. So easy to work with. Absolutely enjoyed every experience here.",5
Really disappointed. Noone even paid attention to us for a long time. While finally I got a hold of a nice waitress. She was great. Otherwise it was awful.,1
"Never disappoints! This location was pretty cool, it’s in the middle of the mall... so great place to go if you’re hungry mid-shopping :)",5
"I had the stuffed mushrooms, pasta napoletana, and a slice of raspberry cheesecake.   Everything was delicious, it's a bit pricey but worth it for a treat sometimes. For the pasta it needed more sauce, so I had about half of the pasta left after I ate the middle section that had the sauce.",5
Server was friendly and food was fantastic!,5
Beautiful location and great food.,5
"Food took forever and was cold when we got it, manager did his best to make us happy but have to be honest",3
Hostess and sitters were very rude and not very helpful for my party of 11. They scattered us all around the restaurant.  The only saving grace was the waitress Heather L.,2
"I wish you had more stars, this was awesome!!!! Loved their creamy cheese cake.",5
Atmosphere is pleasant and staff is friendly. Food is delicious.,5
"Solid, reliable, expansive fare at reasonable prices with courteous and prompt service. Their occasionally-offered New England-style clam chowder is among the best I've eaten anywhere.",5
"Nothing like those fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. Jason provided incredible service! He had several tables, we had a party of 12 (divided into two tables), but he didn't make us wait for anything! Drinks were delivered quickly, bread was hot with plenty butter, appetizers were fresh, and food was delicious! Even received to go packaging and check quickly. Jason was knowledgeable and a welcomed change from the less than friendly late night service that we were receiving moments before at another casino restaurant.",5
"Shopping and Dining at forum shop !
One of the  most popular American restaurant, Cheese cake factory.
I highly recommend this place . Easy menu, fresh and delicious food, reasonable prices and good variety :)
We ordered Crispy Cuban roll and louisiana chicken pasta which is spicy.
Our server Benjamin was wonderful. So polite and professional.",5
The food here is so delicious and lunch specials are great .,5
Wonderful food. Very large portions. Great service. Totally enjoyable and worth the visit. We will return.,5
The wait wasn't as bad as it looked.. our server was awesome and very attentive. Big portions of food as always.,4
"Hello, this is Important!!! Maxi has covid agian Maxi has covid. I live with Maxi both of us got tested and both were found to have it. Maxi does not care if she's gets ppl sick this isn't the first time that
maxi had covid. just to let you know.",1
The honey truffle chicken was amazing.,5
As always the food is very good. Took a while to get the food but it was zuoer busy so that was ti be expected.,4
It was an extremely busy place. The waiter was nice but not exceptionally attentive. Food was average for a Cheesecake Factory.,3
Service awful!! Didn’t receive any bread at all and no refills on our drinks. Salad mix tastes old and wilted and the Avocados are brown. Wait took over an hour and we didn’t even have the basic necessity of salt and pepper at our table. WILL NOT BE RETURNING!,1
The staff was amazing and super courteous. The scenery was breathtaking and the food was wonderful! I recommend getting the spinach and artichoke dip first!,5
"It was awesome.  The waiter and waitress trainee was on top of it.  Friendly,  professional you name it they were outstanding.  Wish I remembered the names.",4
Food was great. Service was great,5
Expect to wait for a table. We decided to get our slices of cheesecake to go. Of course it was yummy!! The cucumber lemonade is the bomb but pricy.,3
"Excellent, hot food on plates, generous portions. I love it!!!",5
"If you in Vegas , you should have to come to cheesecake factory for a good time and great lunch , God I love this place .",5
Always good too much food.,5
The alfredo here is not good. And they cook the noodles a little bit hard. But rhe service was great especially the manager.,3
"Always high quality pasta. This last time I went though, the pasta was a little raw and uncooked. Hopefully they will ensure this won't happen again.",4
"I love the Cheese Cake Factory.   We had a good time, and the food was good",5
Some of the best food I ever ate....and you will receive plenty . The service is superb and the place is warm and inviting.  I highly recommend.,5
Great food and great service.,5
"You got exactly what you pay for, big portions that taste great! My wife got the chicken parm pizza style and I got the herb crusted chicken, the only disappointment we had was that we couldn't finish it!",5
Bomb spaghetti and meatballs 🍝 and the chicken Alfredo was fire! Cuties working here too 🤩🤤,5
Loved it!! Everything was delicious!!!,5
I have been to this location multiple times and I have never been disappointed. Everything is fresh and delicious. You can even sit out more in the mall area and watch the fishes as you eat if you'd like. I definitely recommend stopping into the cheesecake factory when you are nearby.,5
Good food and good service. Accommodated us with our table request.,5
Fantastic restaurant. Amazing menu and food was outstanding. Staff were great. We ate at 3 other restaurants at ceasers and this one was or favorite and it was 1/2 the price . Highly recommend,5
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PLACES ON EARTH! I love this place,5
"Great food great staff and a great price, you can't go wrong.",5
This Miso Salmon is single-handedly saving the Cheesecake Factory! Lol. Well maybe not entirely but it's certainly close. I've heard multiple people tell me that I was missing out and I sure was! The Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp was my go to meal here but not anymore. Miso Salmon FOREVER!,5
Too busy and not best customer service.,4
We went there two days in a row they forgot my cheesecake to go the first day I explained to the manager the second day and he gave me a second piece for free that visit.,5
Awesome food. Amazing customers service from Heather (our waitress). Cocktails was not water down. I give it 5 stars. Much better than the one in Pleasanton Can where I live.,5
Cheesecake Factory never fails to deliver!,4
I went for a birthday dinner food selection and drink amazing but horrible service . Towards end of night when everyone leaving so not that busy and waited 25 mins to get check and half table left by the time they sang happy birthday and my cheese cakes were really small. Always rated cheesecake  4 plus starts until this experience.,3
Great food and Service. The cheesecakes are to die for.,5
For a chain it's good. We have our favorite menu items. Service is usually good. The cheesecakes and cakes are the best.,5
I give 2 stars because the customer service was great. The quality of the meal is what brought the score down. Comparable to a TV Dinner.,2
Over rated... like the rest of the CCF.,1
I had the carne asada steak it was so good and a raspberry lemon cheesecake amezing.,4
"Good food, good service, but drinks way over-priced. Drinks were as much as meals.  No happy hour at this location even though plenty of places on the strip have one.",3
Very unhappy. They told us it would be a 40 minute wait and it ended up being an hour and a half. I understand they can underestimate but when we asked about it they told us they were “wiping down a table for us” we waited 25 more minutes. They could at least be honest,1
"Food and service excellent as usual. Was my 2nd time at that location, would recommend..",5
"Not like any other cheesecake factory because it’s inside cesars palace shopping center.
Service was quick and friendly.
As usual great choice of cheesecakes.
You hardly manage to eat one, we skipped main course and „started“ with dessert. Yummy!",5
"Always a great experience eating at cheesecake factory. I love how the portions are sized well and there is something for everyone on the menu. Oh, and the food is delicious!",5
"The Cheesecake factory doesn't disappoint. The food was delicious,  the service was fast and over all great!",5
"Always good service, and the cheese cake. Wow,can't get enough. That'd be dinner and dessert on one plate, if you can handle that much.  I can't, it hurt. Dont do that to your gut.",4
"great drinks, great food. great customer servicd",5
Let down when we ordered French Onion soup.  They didn't have cheese so they just sent out like this. Rest of food was good and serve too.,2
I've been many times to this chain but never had as pleasant an experience as this one! James our staff member was super! Always engaging in conversation and spreading his positive energy around.. The food was also delicious!,5
"Cheesecake factory in any city, in any state has the best cheesecake anywhere. Great staff at this location",5
This restaurant was awesome!! The menu was vast and the service was impeccable.,5
"A taste sensation, so much more than just cheesecake, the food is delicious with no calorie spared.",5
"Great food and a lot to choose from! Great pricing, not to expensive and it is in caeser palace and it is a great experience !",4
Can't believe I've never tried this place! It was amazing. Large portions and excellent service :),5
Always amazed at all the menu choices,4
"William C., you know what you're doing.

Thanks for really empathizing with us. We, as well as every other set of patrons you serve appreciate you greatly!",5
"Horrible server, never came around. I understand sometimes restaurant gets busy but never the less at least come to bring the bill had to go look for him !!",1
One of my favorite eateries...Loved the Pasta & The Red Velvet Cheesecake gives me life!😇,5
"We always make sure to stop here every time we are in Vegas. The portions are big and the food is good. The service is always great. I’ve been here more times than I can count, and I’ve never been disappointed.",5
"Food was great! The food took a little while to get out, but we'll worth the wait.",5
Really nice and really friendly staff. Only a short wait.,5
"Great menu, lots of choices, Dana was a great server, food was excellent.",5
So declious and the staff was very friendly.,5
"The Cheesecake Factory in The Forum at Caesar's is the place to go for having breakfast when you start mid day in Vegas.

It is located at the end of the mall where the fire show above the aquarium is watched. I usually sit at their bar and have always had great service.  Their bar is a spot where I have met some fun people that have enhanced my Vegas trips over the years.

The restrooms are located upstairs on their 2nd floor.",5
"This is one of the most beautiful cheesecakes I've seen.
Our waiter was kind and patient.",5
Nice little cheesecake factory 🏭 liked it.,5
"Great food, good service.. We will definitely be back.",4
"Amazing food and the staff very friendly always great service
Coming back for more.",5
Bread was too hard waiters were rude to customers not to me But the other customers table next to me You shouldn't talk about customers when they leave and talk about what they can't afford 🤦🏻‍♂️,2
"This was super good, the best meal we had in the dining room",5
"It took over an hour to get our order to table when we were within moments of opening to be seated. Our waiter was attentive, filling water, offering bread & apologizing numerous times for the delay. Soon after, the manager breezed by without a pause saying in passing  ""your meal will be here shortly"". It wasn't & no explanation nor alternative choice offered until after meal was delivered. ""Well they had to make the au juis & it took long. So do you want something else?"" I suggested her to have come by earlier when difficulty was 1st noted & give explanation, maybe alternatives could have intervened to divert this untenable situation. It was too little too late & we'd not choose to come again for delayed delivery of poorly prepared food & unacceptable manager's attitude. The experienced, courteous & caring server could not make up for poor managerial training? Attitude? Food quality? Lack of preparation?",1
great food great staff,5
"The food is alright for it's price, the wait is long and the service is sub-par",3
Delicious dessert after shopping.   Very light and tasty,5
Sharron was the lady that waited on us tonight.. she is amazing and helpful.,5
"1st time here and the food was AMAZING will definitely come back, expect to spend some serious cash tho",5
It's better than IHOP.,4
Always great food and of course best cheesecakes for dessert!,5
Make a reservation wait times are usually 30 min and even longer on weekends. Wait staff is great and food comes out fast.,5
"Worse wait time i ever have on Cheesecake.
I respectfully. I could see a lot table empty, even w/ social distance table and they take so long to clean and put anyone there. Girl in the front desk was rude also.
I never have that bad experience.",1
Worst experience ever the host was really rude and unprofessional. Last time we ever come here . They need to train them a lil better,1
"Great food. You honestly could very easily split an entree between two. I felt so bad wasting all the food we didn't eat. The cheesecake was amazing. The key lime pie was a bit too much tart, but still amazing. The only thing I have to say is DONT BUY THE FISH TACOS. Bleh",4
Wow...large menu..great food....you definitely get a good value...great as always ..have been here many times...seems to be better..maybe we just missed them...and of course fabulous low carb cheesecake!!!,5
Hands down still my favorite place.,5
Slow service is what kills the mood. They shouldnt be seating guests so quickly if they're low staffed. Food is food... it's the cheesecake factory. Fries were stale at least they were warmed.,3
I so much love going here.  I'm never disappointed. The staff is amazing.  Keep up the good job.,5
Loved the cafe americano,4
It's Cheesecake Factory. The food is average. The cheesecake is great. It's a little overpriced hits in every major study. If you're coming here on vacation try something local,3
"Excellent food!! Wait times are usually long, but plenty of stuff to do in close proximity while you wait.",5
"The Food was OK,
But could have been better.",3
Great Food! Portions are too large.,5
"Couldn’t get my food to save my life. Originally 20 minutes, then 45, and finally over an hour. I can’t drive and rely on delivery. Real shame, thank goodness there’s other restaurants.",1
Loved the food and service.,5
Great setting  great food and great service,5
"Vegas Restaurant , we didn't wait long. Fast service , good food",5
Always great. We got amazing service and the food was really awesome.,5
Lunch was really good. Had the breakfast burrito which we shared. Our friend had the red velvet cheesecake and loved it.,5
"Friendly staff, good food but waitress was not knowledgeable about items on menu and kept forgetting what we requested.",4
"Sometimes it can be a little on the pricer side, but always worth it. Food is always fresh and delicious. Of course, you can never beat their desserts! Always eat here at least once or twice while I’m in Vegas!",5
Great price friendly service and excellent food definitely be going back.....,5
Lovely red velvet cheesecake with moist cake & super yumm cheese...try grilled salmon in black pepper sauce..👌🏻,5
Delicious!,5
"There is a huge, I mean, HUGE aquarium right across from Cheesecake Factory 🐡🐠🐟🐚 OMG!! Absolutely Beautiful",5
Very good service and the food is great and lots of choices on their menu!,5
I love the cheesecake and especially the straberry one I literally cant explain how delicious it was,5
Great food great service great scenery,5
"I got the huevos rancheros for brunch here. I thought that it was very good. The other members in my party enjoyed their food as well. Our server was very attentive and we didn't have to wait for a table at all. I think it all just depends on what time you get their during the day. Unfortunately, we did not have any room left for desserts but they looked delicious. Portions sizes are big and the price is decent as well.",5
"The best place to eat I strongly recommend it . First off let's start with the waiter , she was awesome and was very knowledgeable about the job.  Out of every place me and my wife eat that was the only place that made us feel welcome while we was there. I don't normally tip waiters a lot but the way she was being polite and tace care of my wife for her birthday I had to make sure I give her a nice tip to enjoy herself.  The food was very delicious , let's start with the bread 🍞  😋 it was fresh soft and warm. It make you wanna eat bread 🍞 for the whole time you there.  I mean it was so good I had to ask for more and matter of fact I'm on my way to go eat there right now with my wife. They food that me and my wife order with was the steak and rice 🍚  was delicious to the point where I had to double up on a to go box.  The steak was not bland unlike some other place I waste my money on food on.  I'll definitely recommend people to go there for a plate..",5
Food was excellent service needs improvement,4
Great.reasonable priced.have yet to try any cheese cake because am always full after the food.,5
Amazing,5
Good food but it took forever to get it.,4
Great design and atmosphere. Great service as well.,5
"I usually have a great experience at Cheesecake Factory.  Unfortunately, I ordered the Baja tacos and the rice came out cold.  We told the waitress she didn't need to take our whole plate back, just to get us some hot rice.  She said no problem.  She even came back a couple of minutes later and said the rice would be right out. That was the last time we saw anybody, and finished our meal without the rice.  When she came to give us our check, I told her we never received the rice and she did apologize.  I'm sure they are under-staffed because of Covid so I hate to be critical.  To be truthful, it's just nice to be able to go out and eat again.  I still tipped her over 20%.",3
Always have a good experience at the cheesecake factory whichever location we visit,5
I really enjoy this place. Food is great each time 😋,5
Super accommodating and understanding of large parties due to covid I really appreciate you all being so helpful for my birthday dinner!,5
Beautiful restaurant inside Ceasars Palace. Always crowded..,4
Expect a 1 hour+ wait and 1.5 hour wait for food.  I ordered the De Vinci's pasta with extra sauce(much needed); noodles over cooked.,3
The food was bad.  Fish and chips came out with the fish burnt and French fries over cooked and the fries were cold.  The beet and avocado salad was ok but it's kind of hard to ruin a salad.  The server was sweet but slow.  We had to ask our server to wipe the table after we were seated.  The only good part was being able to watch the fish in the aquarium while we ate.  If you're hungry for more than a salad walk on by this one.,2
Love it...Delicious food and the service was Oustanding. .,5
"This is my first time at a Cheesecake Factory so thought they only served Cheesecake, but they have all kind of foods including many healthy options. I had a great tasting salad and low carb cheesecake which were both really good. The service was amazing.",5
Great customer service and great food. Numerous options,5
"It's always good food here the gumbo is a good choice I prefer the white rice with it, also the almond crusted salmon kale salad is very good I love this place friendly staff also",5
Amazing food and super nice staff.,5
I am sure the food is good. But if you have the option go to a stand alone location rather than the mall because it took an hour and half to find parking and then we got there it was an hour and a half to get a table so we decided to leave. Reservations recommended,2
"Wasn't from the area, had to dig for this place like a needle in the hay stack, but it was so worth the effort! That oreo cheesecake was slamming",5
I love this place! The food is always good (What you'd expect from a Cheese Cake Factory) and the servers are always nice. I hope they resume the Atlantis show in Caesars regardless this is a great option for a good food reasonably priced. There are a lot of options so there is something for everyone and they still celebrate birthday patrons. We'll be back.,5
Good customer service,4
"Great food, great service",5
First let me say thank you to Dana. Fantastic job my dear. While my pasta wasn't the best everything else we had was fantastic. My husband and I enjoyed our last meal of our very first vacation. P.S. my daughter really loved her Salted Carmel cheesecake.,4
Food was great. Our waitress was a delight and very good at her job !,5
Lunch specials were delicious and very generous.  We had dinner from the leftovers!  Service was very good.,5
Great service only reason i give it a 4 the food was ok and the cheesecake ive had better and im a huge fan of cheesecake,4
"Arguably my most favorite restaurant! Weekend brunch was fantastic. The cinnamon roll pancakes and the lemon-ricotta pancakes were other worldly! Belgain Waffles were great. Crispy and delicious; way better than anywhere else.
As always, the service is spectacular.",5
Good burgers 👌🏼 fun waitress and cool location.,4
If you don't have the patience to wait or you want food right away this is not the place to go. I went there a few time while in Vegas and every time it was no less than a hour wait.. But the food and the service is always on point.,4
Delighted they've improved their menu with healthier food. Kudos!,5
They have good cheese cake,5
"Food was delicious. Staff is amazing. Ordered orange chicken, calamari, crispy crab watons, and Dynamite shrimp.",5
"Place was great,. But it took a long time to get our food and my burger was burnt",3
Quick service for my food and my red velvet cheese cake was delicious,5
"I used to come here at least a twice per month, the food, the service are the tops. Waiting when everything goes back to normal, Thanks for a great service and your great salads! We will be back.",5
"Beautiful place, great customer service & excellent food",5
It's nice a little too pricy for the food waiter was the best,5
"I can’t say enough about this place, it was exceptional,the service the food everything!!! You won’t be disappointed!!",5
Best chicken marsala I've ever had,5
Loved the seating we had.  Great food and great service as well.  Had a lot of fun just chatting with family and the waiter.,5
It’s was a very nice environment great drinks but  I got the chicken teriyaki the chicken was good but they served it on rice that wasn’t fully cooked it was so crunchy....,2
"Good healthy food, fantastic service with a great atmosphere.",5
Really nice coffee and not that expensive. Strawberry cheese cake..... was too slow to take a picture. It was awesome!,4
Got a spicy gumbo and a lemon cheesecake slice to die for melted in my mouth,5
Love it 10 🌟,5
"The quality is poor now. The service is bad. 2 years ago was the best . Now food , service , is bad",2
Amazing,5
Our waiter went above and beyond! Excellent experience!,5
The food runner probably should've gotten our tip but it was delicious lol.,4
The food was so delicious even though the wait time was real long it was worth the wait I highly agree on eating here,5
"Worst experience ever waited 2hours to be asked for my familyof 5 to be split and then waited another 20min to be sat. Have in mind i was qouted a wait time of 1 hour and 45mins.

plus one of their host named Evony completely disrespectful and immature. Mangers seemed like they couldn't handle their jobs the only one that was polite and efficient was my server.

Put my named down at 6:40pm didn't get seated til 8:45pm didn't get my food until 9:30pm only to get two of my entrees wrong.

Will definitely no be coming back to this restaurant! when visiting Vegas",2
Delicious from beginning to end very nice place give it a10,5
My first time have the shrimp scampi and loved it!!!! Definitely will order it again,4
Wonderful Thanksgiving dinner 🍴,5
Quiet.  The best strawberry martinis,5
The food is prepared fresh and taste amazing! The service is awesome!,5
"Very good place to eat!!, good food and good drink's 🍹",5
Always delicious at every location.  Waiter Freddy wade attentive and the restaurant was adhering to social distancing.,5
Andrew was the best server we have in a long time. He was great and so was the food. Thanks.,5
How can you go wrong with this place? They have everything and the cheese cake is amazing,5
Great food and service. Manager even stopped to help clean a spill and get a replacement drink,5
I'm NEVER disappointed!,5
Called on 8/30 at 5:15pm to make a reservation and the front desk lady that answered was extremely rude.,1
"Loved it, and reasonable prices for Vegas!",5
excellent food and service,5
"Amazing food and drinks, our server was very sweet and took great care of our party. Good portions for the price. And of course, the cheesecake was delicious.",5
Cheesecake was amazing but don't serve in order of orders 😡 waited 20 minutes for them to serve everyone else after us,3
Everything was delicious and the service was flawless.,5
Everything was good but my food was a lil rushed in getting it out to the table.,4
Service and food were great!,5
"I love the atmosphere at this location. We tried the Thai lettuce wraps, which were amazing! My favorite thing to order is the Chicken Bellagio, it is always delicious!",5
"Food was not good, pasta was not done and very dry",2
Horrible service cold food and the chicken on my paste was 3 small pieces about the size of a nickel.,1
The service from the front reception to the server was great.  As always the food portion and taste was fantastic!  Support your local restaurants and workers during this pandemic.,5
"Really good food, good portions, and only a bit more  than the 'cheap' food.  And it's worth the trip on Sunday morning to get the fried chicken and waffles.",5
Linda’s fudge cake ftw!,5
Everything was great. It was noisy because the restaurant was full but our server was great and the food delicious!,5
"I ordered a scoop of ice cream for my 5 year old and the charged me $10.00. It should have been $3.50 off the kids menu. Why would I want such a big scoop for a small child. Since when is ice cream $10.00 anyway. It was just vanilla, nothing special.",3
"If you haven't tried the best cheesecake in Las Vegas, you don't know what you're missing.",5
"Awesome, great spot to chill in the Cesar Palace mall",5
We waited over an hour for our food. They apologized a few times. I was kind of shocked that we didn't get comped or anything to make up for it.. That's a long time to wait. It was the best veggie burger I've ever had though!,3
Miso Salmon is one of my favorite dishes. It was pretty good. Rice wasn't overcooked. The waitress and cook tried her hardest to accommodate my friend with an onion allergy.,4
"I love this place! From the staff,and the AWESOME FOOD always a pleasant joint to relax!!",5
"Very good food, friendly staff",4
"Tasty Desserts, nice atmosphere",5
"Good service, good food, but spendy",4
Bad service.. no bread.. dirty tables... smh,1
"This was just a take out order because the wait was 1 hour long.  However, the desert was awesome as usual and the counter staff was very polite.",5
Chicken Marsala was fantastic... I just wishes I had a mini fridge and a microwave back at hotel to take my leftovers ... I would have had 2 fabulose meals... of course I had the cheesecake too and again it is called the cheesecake factory for a reason ... yum 😆,5
Great service and delicious food.,5
"If you are in Las Vegas and want to eat good food that is priced consistent with all other Cheesecake Factories and not inflated ""Vegas"" pricing, this is the place! I had one of my usual dishes (Jambalaya Pasta) and it did not disappoint. Super good service too.",5
A very pleasant place to have a lunch. Very good service and food. Reasonable prices. Definitely recommend.,5
Margarita and salted caramel cheesecake at 10 in the morning with jetlagg...loved both and received no judgement!!!,5
Had appetizers and cheesecake. Both delicious as always.,5
Love this restaurant! Huge meals but can't deny dessert even very full. Love it!!,4
Not my favorite but good.,4
"Great food, good prices, and a lady who never let our water glasses for empty. Husband was happy with his chicken meal. Not enough room left over in our stomachs for cheesecake.",5
We had the best waitress  ever.,5
Alicia was an awesome waitress. She made good recommendations. Also extremely nice & attentive. I'll definitely visit the location again,5
Served really good food but wish we did not have to walk all the way into the forum shops and find it hiding in the corner. It should be out on the Strip.,4
"Slow service at the Take-Out Counter. Cheesecake was amazing, though.",4
This is a must for us every time we come to Vegas!!!,5
Wide variety of food but don't come here for healthy options or you will be disappointed.,4
"love it here, great food for everyone!!",5
The Food Is Delicious 😋,5
"Very friendly people, very quick service and the food was just delicious. I truly enjoyed it.",5
Great burgers and of course fantastic cheesecake.,5
Very busy. Loved the cinnamon roll cheesecake.,5
"The Corona did good wite 25% capacity, the service was excellent, the food was delicious, long waiting to get in.

Omg so good!!! I got the chicken parmesan pizza style. Super delicious. Thin chicken parm smothered with melted white cheese and topped with some spaghetti. I switched the alfredo sauce for marinara. The Georgoa Peach drink was strong and tasty and really good.,5

"Had a great time 🙂, service was good, 🍷 drinks were a bit high, but overall was good time.",5
They was very clean n very respectful n yr food came quickly,5
My wife and daughter needed a cheesecake fix. So we didn't eat in the restaurant but dealing with the folks at the host stand....they were cool and had a sense of humor. I thought that was cool/odd for thier clientele in a place like Ceasars. And the folks behind the desert counter were awesome as well.,5
Great service. Food was delicious..,5
Everything is soooo delicious!,5
My wife and I ate our wedding here 😋,5
The cheese burger spring rolls are delicious.,4
"Complementary bread and butter are no small part of the meal. Tomato, basil, mozzarella flatbread pizza is incredibly fresh, as if it's ingredients were freshly plucked from the garden.",5
"Great service. A little hard to find, but a nice and quiet spot for a date.",5
"The service was slow and I found a hair in my hibachi steak, so gross! The food did taste great though.",3
Great food and good services.,5
Soft chicken tacos were excellent,5
Food was amazing service was great. Very little wait.,5
Good food. Loved the Godiva chocolate cheesecake!!,4
I normally love cheesecake. Today service wasn’t good. Multiple mistakes lead to us leave before we ate. Disappointed. Hopefully only a rare incident. But we won’t be back again in this trip.,2
Excellent service and food.  Thanks for having us,5
I had the pineapple upside down cheesecake and loved ever last bite of it.,5

Our waitress was great,5
Nice place,4
Had chocolate tower cake and chocolate chip cheese cake... It  was amazing.. The homemade whipped cream was so good.. The hubby and I fought over it...,5
"Great food, great service.. Only downside is the seating is not plus size friendly. Booths too small, chairs wayy too small.",3
It was very slow the service we ask for ketchup for my grandson fries never was delivered forgot my husband dink steak was hard the food was delivered in pauses  we can't eat together i don't think i like to go back .,1
"Missing ingredients in four cheese pasta, server was rude and not helpful",1
Great food great service!!!,4
"Had a reservation for 8:00 pm for 4 people, but still had to check in and waited till 8:25 pm till we were seated. Food was good and came in a timely manner. A couple people in our party ordered Long Islands, and they didn't even look the same. Had to return it.",4
"Great place to eat after a day of shopping or enjoying the views. Best desserts ever, the upside down Pineapple cheesecake is delicious. It's a bit pricey though.",5
Excellent. Nice food. Food Quantity too much.,5
"Best Cheesecake Factory I’ve been to. The difference with the one in Santa Monica or San Fransisco is day and night. My hibachi steak was perfectly cooked, very tasty and well presented, service was great and waiting time was acceptable. The cocktails we ordered were also much better then the other 2 locations. This was a very positive surprise!",5
"Sharon C was our waitress tonight and she was AWESOME!   We’ve eaten here many times, but she made this time super enjoyable! It was late and she never lost her great personality or work ethic!   You rock Sharon!",5
Everything I got other than cheesecake sucked,2
Ummm good!,5
I love the food and the oreo cheesecake is so good,5
Check out at the bakery awesome people there.,5
Can't go wrong with the cheesecake factory,5
Food was good but I must say was a lil cold to have taken so long to bring out.,4
Can never say enough about the cheesecake!,5
Oh my the Cheesecake Factory is to die for!! You got to give it a chance if you like desserts!!,5
All tho the food was good I order a BBQ Burger came with no BBQ 🤣🤣 plus they don't offer a military discount,1
Great food great service loved it,5
Great customer service. Thank you,5
Waiter was fantastic food was excellent!,5
I love this place. Great service great food and the best cheesecakes. Wish they made one we're we live. Harlingen Texas,5
"16 of us & they sat us in 35 minutes.  Dinner was fabulous, our waitress was stellar.",5
Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Food was delicious.,5
over rated and over priced for a cheesecake. but i still love it lol,5
"I'll start off by saying the only downer here is waited about 20 minutes but we did get the outdoor/indoor in Caesar's Palace. I definitely had the lemon cheesecake which was on point I must say!

I love the ambience and the view of the fish tank if you see it in the outer foyer. Nothing special at this Cheesecake but definitely not any negatives at this place as well. The server and the hostess were very welcoming and the food was as expected. Always a good place after you spend so much money shopping at Caesars Palace!",5
Very good food and ambiance,5
Good luck with getting a reservation with the Co-Vid 19 lockdown.    Could not get through by phone and then it was booked in person also.    Just do take away if you have so much restrictions.,1
DO NOT GO THERE! Made a reservation and it did no good still had to wait a hour. Then the food was terrible. Who breads shrimp scampi. Will never go there again.,1
"Service was excellent, food was okay.",4
My first time at a Cheesecake factory and it was grand! Boy I loved the chicken pot stickers and the red vlevet and cocoa mocha cheesecake!,5
Always wonderful,5
"Food was just blah. It seemed to be much better 10 years ago or so. The jambalaya pasta was okay, it wasn't bad, it just want game changing. They have many options like Cajun and Thai and American when they should just focus on one type of cuisine. Service was good. Portion sizes were healthy.",3
You need to work on your online orders and make sure nothing is missing before you send it. I’m very disappointed.,1
"We ordered at the walk up counter and had a seat in the dining area. We were quickly asked if we were seated by someone. When we said no and explained we went to their walk up counter, we were asked to leave immediately. I’ve never seen such a rude restaurant staff in my life! Will NEVER eat at ANY Cheesecake Factory again!!",1
Great food.,5
"Fantastic experience our waitress was helpful and cheerful she offered to compliment my hot water (i have a sore throat)with lemon slices and honey. Despite the small delay serving/prep the food she had her smile on all the time, and checked on us several times keeping the the refills coming without interruption. It was an excellent example of customer service that made our eating experience more enjoyable",5
"Very friendly staff, amazing waitress! And the food was delicious, on our next trip to vegas we will be eating here again!",5
Good good place yummy food after 11 am they have a show outside of their location on the hour every hour. Our server was seriously the best. Dont remember his name but he didn't even write down our order he paid close attention to what we wanted and got everything right👍 will come back again to try their other food.,5
Amazing experience.,5
"Had a very unpleasant experience with my server named Dana. She is stealing customers money. We paid in cash $100 for our roughly $70 meal; she proceeded to come back and ask us if we needed change. We told her yes because we had already put a cash tip on the table. A lot of time went by so me and my friends decided she could keep the change as her tip because we had somewhere else to be.

Would you believe Dana came out and said we did not pay for our food! We proceeded to remind her that she just asked if we wanted change and we gave her two $50 bills. She told the manager that we were lying so we told them to pull the tapes.

We patiently waited for the manager to come back and apologize....as she should. She actually came down and says she only saw that we picked up our phone but she does apologize and we could leave.

Nooooo you saw us pay and you saw your server pocket the $100 and proceed to ask us to pay for the meal again. We were so embarrassed and upset because how could something like this even be okay?! The manager also gave us our $30 tip back in the form of a gift card because “Ms. Dana” would not cough up our cash. I requested the corporate number and when I left I gave them a call. Tell me why on the other line of the phone it was a server at the restaurant I just left instead of the corporate office. I had to walk back to the restaurant again to speak to the manager!!!! She finally gave the official corporate office number and I filed a formal complaint against Dana! I have no issue with The Cheesecake Factory nor the manager who was kind enough to apologize on Dana’s behalf but the thief of a server needs to be fired. I can only imagine how many times she has done this and got away with it and I would hate to see anyone else go through this awful treatment!",1
"Poor customer service. lazy staff.
Pieces are smaller than usually CF cuts. Cashier 5/8/2021 shift 2pm doesn't fit for this position.
Highly don't recommend to visit this location.",1
Whats not to love about Cheesecake Factory except wishing their prices weren't so high.,5
this place is horrible. we waited half an hour for something that should’ve been done half an hour ago. this place is incompetent and the people are absolutely ridiculous. we preordered a cake and they decided to make it just then. absolutely horrendous. would not recommend.,1
"First time ever eating here loved the food & the service the only reason I’m giving three stars is because at the end our server stole our change from our bill
not only did she get a tip but stole our change of 30.",3
Had 1 of best waiters. Food was great.  Should definitely try the sliders,5
"It took a long time to get seated, long time for drinks, and for food even looker. We were here two years ago and everything was excellent",1
Great Experience at the cheesecake their chipotle pasta is amazing,5
Service is kinda slow. But food is always great.,4
"Visiting Vegas and America for first time I had to experience The cheese cake factory, my experience was really great I’m pleased to say, very friendly welcoming staff, food arrived in reasonable time and the quality was great they also do great cocktails

Very reasonable prices for great food",4
"Well it was my granddaughters birthday day, we made  reservations, but when we got there, guess what, no reservations. Now after an hours wait to  be seated,another hour for the food ( that's a little exaggeration) ok 50 minutes, we finally got everything. The cold part is they didn't acknowledge they made a mistake, they blamed us.We did  have a really nice waitress, kinda smoothed everything out.",3
I went here as a gift for my friend I didn't like it so much,3
"Our Food was frickin Excellent!!!
Our service was great and the atmosphere delightful.  Excellent choice for quality comfort.",5
Amazing. Been to several in diff states but wonderful service.,5
Cool place.,5
"The food was amazing, seriously try the Thai Chicken Salad. The staff were kind and helpful. Best Cheesecake Factory I’ve been to.",5
Steak that I had at the cheese factory was delicious and the kids there were great waiting on it we had a really good time and the cheesecake was to die for,5
Good Burgers and Great Bread Awesome Service and will keep going back every time and we can not forget the CHEESECAKE!!!!,5
2-hour wait and really disorganized so we moved on,3
"Service was very unhelpful.  Waiter put his notepad away before we were done ordering.  It isn't like they were busy.  I think the waiter only had 2 other customers.  We had to remind him multiple times for sauce, place setting, etc.  Food was excellent as always but I won't return to the Forum Cheesecake Factory.  Still love the cheesecake factory.",3
"Long wait , great food.",4
I called to ask if reservations were required and if they were still taking guests since it was close to scheduled closing time. They said no just come in. 10 minutes later I arrive and was told it's a 2 hour wait.,1
Did get to eat they just closed for a wedding shower but the gal was supper sweet and felt bad she came across that she cared,3
"I never write reviews but I just have to write this one. I went here with my wife and we will never be back again. This was the worst food we have had in a restaurant, ever. I had fettuccini alfredo with chicken and my wife had shrimp with angel hair. It was the most chewy fettuccini i have ever tried to eat, the chicken tasted like canned chicken, and the ""rich parmesan cream sauce"" tasted like warm half & half and had neither a parmesan or cream flavor. My wife was really disappointed in the overcooked shrimp. Pick a different place, I wish we would've.",1
Great service great food,5
Very slow service.,2
"Awesome service, our waitress was super friendly and sweet!!",5
Was told there was no wait and then they discovered we had a stroller and then the wait become 20-30 minutes. The stroller is fairly small and doesn’t take up that much room. The food and service was good and as always the cheesecake was great. It was a little upsetting to see bigger parties that showed up after us get seated first.,3
"Far back in the forum shops in Caesar's Palace, you get a view of a great aquarium while you eat in the front, food is outstanding! Staff and service top notch!!",5
Love me sum cheesecake from here,5
Service was really really really bad and food was just okay,3
Very good,5
Customer service is above and beyond.....the food was delicious as well.,5
I really don't know. I just walked by for crying out loud. 🙂,3
"Great cheesecake, and avokado rol is amazing.
The pasta was tasty but not extraordinary.",5
The service and food was great! Great place to have a nice dinner with your loved one.,5
"My meal was fantastic,  the service was great and the cheesecake was awesome!",5
"Great place, hot water for Chinese!",5
"Not the greatest experience from a cheese cake factory I've had.  Took over 20 minutes to receive a slice of cheesecake and well over 30 to clear the table as I'm writing this the food is still here.  Very quick to give the bill and charge the card...

Below average service for sure at this location.  Only upside was the cheesecake was good.  Beyond that wouldn't recommend this location again.",1
So I am a bit biased as I work for The Cheesecake Factory so of course I LOVE the place...Not only is the food EXCELLENT..the company is also great to work for....,5
I never ate here but this looks like rich people restaurant,5
Lunch here was absolutely awesome!,5
loved the atmosphere & food was amazing good costumer service! Would come again 10/10,5
Dinner was awesome as usual.  The service was outstanding as well.  Social distance and cleaning were in effect and we'll executed.,5
Good tasty food,4
"Good experience. They have fantastic employees & The best Cheesecake. The food was great and filling. Amazing atmosphere and great ambience. A little crowded but worth the wait in line. I've been here many times with family, friends and associates.. I'll be back again..My first time at the cheesecake factory was in Beverly Hills with my mother in the 80's.. I'll have to bring my mother here for lunch..  I'll let you guys know how it went later.",5
"Wow I see all the hype over this place, first timer and will be back. I had the Dan Dan noodles and pork dumplings and was impressed. This place was busy and it was 1pm so I would definitely expect a wait.

But I asked for sriracha and they had none!! This needs to be fixed, their spicy sauce wasn't enough for me personally.",4
Good drinks and late night bite,3
The food was good. It was crazy crowded though.. expect a wait right now.,5
Really good food for a Great price,5
10 stars...had wonderful  food & excellent desert...definitely will be hitting your location again,5
"One of the best customer service, tasty, authentic food. Would greatly recommend, and reasonal price.
I will surely come back soon!",5
Alfredo was not good and had no flavor,1
The food was delicious and the Cheesecake was remarkable! Thank you.,5
Always a great meal.,5
The cheesecake is awesome!!,5
Amazing Belgian waffle with strawberry and pecans and chilaquiles with carnita love the fresh hot bread,5
Expensive and to be honest could be better for the price. But if u eat in the mall it will always cost ya,3
"Service slow , waiting time was an hour.  Great waiter just very poor timing on when needed",3
"Always a great choice. With a Really good hAppy hour, nice cuts of meet and great drink selection.
Plus it's in a great  location and has been around forever.",4
"Yardbirds was straight fire! I ordered the the half chicken with biscuits, and Mac and cheese! The chicken had an explosive amount a flavor. Highly recommend using the hot honey sauce! Simply amazing! Biscuits dipped in honey butter was amazing as well! As for the Mac and cheese, it was simply ok.

Just a disclaimer, the chicken is probably way over priced, but this can be expected when being in Vegas. The food is really good though and you won't be disappointed, so give this place a try!",4
"Its easy to make reservation, the staff are very friendly, and the bartenders are the best! It's a definite must if you're going to the Shops!",5
"I love this Cheesecake at the Forum Shops.
This has the best trained staff of any of the Cheesecakes that I have been to.

Tip... if it is Thursday, you MUST get the Chicken Tortilla Soup... so amazing!",5
Why in the world are you guys sending out door dash orders with no utensils or napkins. You do realize you're in the middle of the largest tourist city with ppl who are traveling and are staying in hotels that don't have silverware.  I found it really difficult to eat your nasty spaghetti with just my fingers.,1
"It's definitely a treat for us to eat at Cheesecake Factory, as we don't have one where we live. For a chain restaurant, the menu items, including the cheesecakes, are exciting and interesting. Portions are plentiful and food is flavorful. The hibachi steak is a must-have for us and we also like their pasta and salads. I do wish they had brighter lighting inside, as I like to see what I'm eating. Service was attentive and food was brought out quickly. The fish tank outside is great for keeping kids occupied while you wait for your table!",5
"** If you're hungry or have kids or are with a large group go somewhere else **
We arrived at the restaurant at 1PM. I wasn't sure if they'll be able to serve as we were a large group - two families, ten people overall. After the hosts checked I was very happy to be assured we'll get a table in 20-25 minutes.  50 minutes later we were told that our table is being cleared and we'll be seated 3-4 minutes after that. 10 more minutes went by before we were called in to sit down. Having spent so much time outside we already looked at the menu and told our server we were ready to order when we were being sat down. We got our breads and the server took our order. 40 minutes later our food started coming out. It took about 10-15 minutes for all of our food to make it out. When I asked to speak to a manager to ask if this was typical service times she said that as far as she's been told it only took 16 minutes to bring our food out since we ordered it. After I asked her to recheck, she came back and said very shortly that it took 39 minutes to bring our food out and that that was normal. She said she doesn't care how much time we waited outside.",1
The food was amazing Gil l and Chris did an  amazing job. Awesome wait staff and the food was even better. Highly recommend trying the Wellington,4
"45 min wait turned into 1hour and 40 min wait.
Food was good. I ordered Chicken maderia and steak n shrimp.",4
Food was good,5
I eat here ever time I am in Vegas. Huge menu and good prices. The Americana burger was recommended to us by our server and it was so good we went back the next day. Only complaint is that I never have room for cheesecake!,5
"Never disappointed when I eat here! Food, drinks, service all great!",5
Make sure to get some cheesecake 🤩,5
"Went to this Cheesecake Factory location while on vacation in Las Vegas with my family last week. Normally, I’ve had a great experience at other Cheesecake Factory locations, but this one was despicable.

Went up to be seated, was told it would be a 5-10 minute wait for a table of four, and was given a buzzer to be called when my table was ready. I thought “great! This is a short wait!” But, was I wrong.

I was called up by the buzzer and greeted by Jack. He took my buzzer and told me to wait just behind the counter and someone will seat me in just a moment. Stood with my family as more parties of four came up and were seated right away, yet we were ignored. This went on for about 10-15 minutes.

I went up to speak with Jack again. He was speaking with another customer at the time and when he was finished, he COMPLETELY IGNORED ME, and began talking to another customer who just walked up.

My father got angry and spoke with someone else who was seating people. When he started talking with her, Jack turned and said, with MUCH attitude I might add, “you’ll be seated shortly, folks.” I gave him that attitude right back and told him we’ve been ignored and a number of parties of four have been seated before us when we were here first. As I was saying this sentence, he started talking over me and repeating that we’ll be seated in a moment. Finally, we were seated, with NO apology from anyone about what happened.

Only reason I’m giving two stars instead of one is because our waitress was fantastic. I’m sad I didn’t get her name, but she had all our food and drinks out so quickly, it was wonderful.

I hope someone from management sees this and teaches Jack how to properly treat and speak to customers.",2
"Really bad customer service.
Sat there for at least 30 minutes and no one even made eye contact...",1
"Been here for dinner during my Las Vegas visit. The food here was yummy! The view from the giant glass window is amazing and you can see the beautiful view of the city. Totally recommend this for great dinner night or lunch out. Only thing is, food is bit pricey but tasty. Restaurant is gorgeous!",5
One of our fave places to grab a bite,5
"Great spot to eat while wandering the strip. The prices are extremely fair for on strip restaurants, and the food is top notch. The staff is extremely friendly and just attentive enough. We received to rounds of bread (delicious) in the time while we ordered and waited for our food. The food was nicely plated and delicious. Not one miss in our experience.

Only thing I would change is leaving room for the cheesecake. We couldn't manage it after eating an appetizer, having an appetizer salad, and our mains. Can't wait to go back!",5
Good food and great service. ASK FOR Christina she was great!,4
Amazing service! We were a party of 24ppl. We booked a reservation several days in advance. They were able to serve the whole table at once. I was very impressed. I was happy they were able to accommodate such a large party. Thank you,5
"Love the large plates, never need more than what they offer",5
Food was good and fresh as usual,5
"A little slow to greet or be of assistance at the counter for a cheesecake to go. The cheesecake was phenomenal tho. I tried the salted Carmel it was a little less than $10. For the price I thought the slice was a little pricey, but I could hardly make it through the whole slice and I saved some for breakfast 😬",4
Good food though a little expensive for my tastes,4
Great Food :),5
Delicious everything thing was good with no problems 😊 😋 😀.,4
Great and friendly service! Great food and reasonably priced.,5
Great service and delicious food as expected... had the Caesar Salad and Crusted Chicken Romano... :),5
"Wait staff was tremendous and food, as always, was delicious!",5
Excellent service excellent prices very good food a lot for your money.,5
Mmmm. Delicious,5
Wait was long but worth it!,5
Good food,4
"Food is mediocre and can be a hit or miss . Could be too salty or not enough flavor but one thing I can depend on are the avocado egg rolls ! I could eat about two orders if my stomach allowed . Overall, I feel some dishes are over priced for the quality but this is an ideal place for a casual meet up or happy hour . I wouldn’t consider this “fine dining “ .",3
"Good place to enjoy
Was good place",3
One of the best places that sell cheese cakes here in california,5
The food was very good and service was amazing,5
We were seated quickly. Service and food was great.,5
Fast and efficient service.,4
Great food,5
"I had a great experience at this Cheesecake Factory. The server was very attentive to us and the pizza I ordered was very good and delectable. We didn't get any cheesecake, but the nachos we got as an appetizer was delicious. I just they put more chicken in the nachos.",5
"Wonderful service, good food and very customer service oriented. Both waitress and manager were super accommodating.
Enjoyed it very much!",5
I ate the chicken parmesan pizza and it was sizable and delicious! It's could easily be shared between two people!,4
Beautiful atmosphere,5
"Delicious food in enormous portions. If you go before 5pm you can get a lunch sized portion of different meals, pasta for example. The lunch size portion is best if you want to have room left for cheesecake. I highly recommend the Adam's Peanut Butter Cheesecake. Service is friendly, and over 4 visits to this location I've never once had to wait or even ask for a refill on drink or water.",5
"This place is inside Cesar’s Palace which is cool it has a large salt water fish tank just outside with a show every hour.

The restaurant is usually crowded. We didn’t have much room at our table. We had a group of five.

The food is good as always. With a few exceptions.
I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo which is delicious and my go to favorite. The shrimp was way over cooked and rubbery unfortunately, but came in a really great portion size. Also the bread was a little overdone/crispy.

My wives steak tacos were delicious but they came after everyone was already done eating. Like 15-20 minutes after everyone else’s food came out. They did give her a free cheesecake for the trouble though...

The waiters were really apologetic and accommodating though.

So this place is average compared to other Cheesecake Factories but it’s cool to go see the show outside if you plan on it beforehand!",3
This place is always great. I don't usually eat food as we go just for the cheesecake but we decided to get an appetizer to go with and oh man they were yummy! And the slices of cheesecake were so big! Great place. Great service as well.,5
Have always enjoyed Cheesecake factory. Facilities are cosmetically outdated and could use a remodel.,5
"Decent food. Generous portions. Years ago food was very good, but now it is just okay. Service was nice.",3
"Friendly staff, food is delicious and fresh",5
Great food and service.,5
"The food was great, the service was great.",5
So many choices all delicious!!,5
Good food and great service!,4
"This iconic restaurant does not disappoint. The service is always excellent and the food is over the top. Portions are VERY generous and we've been able to share an entree between us to ensure we have lots of appetite and room for some cheesecake. If you're in doubt about getting dessert, I'd recommend starting with the cheesecake first then move on to the main course.",5
"I know this is chain restaurant and have eaten at Coral Gables & Aventura locations several times but this Cheesecake is located inside the Cesar's Forum shops where diners can watch the Fall of Atlantis show for free. We sat on the terrace and it was great for people watching.

Ordered the Smoke House BBQ burger (Smoked Bacon, Cheddar, Onion Strings, Ranch BBQ). This burger was pretty enormous and mighty tasty. Bacon & onion rings were crispy. The patty was juicy medium. It came with fries so this was definitely a filling lunch for $12. My friend got the Factory Burger and said that it was also good.

Service was swift and polite. Got seated in 5 minutes and food came in a timely manner. We were on a Monday so weekends are probably a lot busier from reading other reviews.",4
"One of my favorite places to eat in vegas ,great service",4
Shepard pie is amazing!,5
"Was waiting for a table and decided to go to the bar to grab some drinks in the mean time. Not acknowledged whatsoever,  with their slow, practically empty bar. Wish I knew their names because was purposely ignored. Asian girl and a guy with glasses. Only saying this because I own a restaurant myself - please talk to your employees about hospitality.",1
Scampi gumbo was super.,5
It was excellent as usual.,5
"Great location, inside the Forum Shops. Very disappointing dining experience. Service was not up to par with my expectations.",3
"I admit, I couldn't quite believe it when I saw how high The Cheesecake Factory in Las Vegas had been rated previously.

...and then we went and were not disappointed. Located by the Atlantis show in Caesars Palace, it not only provides entertainment value, it also serves tasty food and delicious wines. On top of that, we had one of the most genuinely friendly waiters I've ever met.",5
Always worth a visit. Apart from the obvious sweet treat you can also enjoy a really nice lunch. Service was great,5
"My husband and I have been eating at Cheesecake Factories for over 15 years, in the Chicago area, Indianapolis, and Orlando, and have always enjoyed the food, but the Cheesecake Factory at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas has proved to be an exception.  We recently ate lunch at the Caesar’s Palace location and half of my husband’s meal arrived cold and my meal was not prepared properly based on on the same meal purchased at other locations.  I would not recommend dining at this location in Las Vegas.",1
"The best chicken Madeira and cheesecake!
The place is beautiful and the server was the sweetest !
Loved every second and every bite! A must to go.",5
"Great food, great service!
Love the stunning aquarium right next to our tables!",5
Great food.  I had the spicy Chicken pasta.  Service was a little slow otherwise it would have been 5 stars.,4
Unbelievable flavor.  Lighter than air beer batter for the fish and chips,5
A true 5 star restaurant!,5
"One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  Tremendous variety and the desserts - wow.  We have dined here and are never disappointed.  Shout out to our server of many years, Karen!",5
So good!,5
It was delicious and the service was awesome,5
"Busy but great service.  Try the Korean Fried Cauliflower, it's like vegetarian wings!!! Delish!!",5
"Started off slow as there was no server for the patio and we had to wait for a bit. Then all of a sudden, Ashley J appeared and made the evening way better. Her upbeat attitude was great!! Made the whole dinner great. Food was awesome!!! The Adult Chocolate shake  for the wife (The Flying Gorilla) was killer. 1st bottled beer i got was a little warmer than normal. Beer must be cold!! Ashley made sure the next one as ice cold... Thanks guys!!",5
Good food and friendly staff.  I visit the restaurant everytime I go to Las Vegas!,5
"Great service, delicious food as always!",5
Food was delicious  and service was amazing will be back soon,5
Nice eatery,4
Very busy but worth it.,4
"Clean, good food and environment was Amazing",5
Always great,5
Food Sucks....server was amazing,1
Great!. Love the lighting and great staff.,5
Great food!,4
"Good food - the chicken enchiladas are always a favorite here. Of course, the cheesecake deserts are also excellent, not to mention, extremely filling. For Las Vegas, I have to say, I'm impressed that this location (especially being inside Caesar's mall) doesn't gouge prices - they're pretty much comparable to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants I've visited in less luxurious areas. With the overpriced / over-rated nature of a lot of restaurants on the Vegas Strip, this is a very reasonable alternative for lunch or dinner.",4
Beautiful place,5
The food was great! The wait was awful. We waited at last an hour and a half.,5
Or server was lovely and I thought it did was fine (lettuce tacos and beets and goats cheese salad) but an hour later there were repercussions of the not nice kind.,2
"We dined here in the evening last Monday (October 14th) and had an exceptional experience, both from the quality of our meals and from our amazing server (Tony). We were seated in a two-person booth directly behind the front counter (2nd booth in, if I recall), right by the entrance, on the right side. In that this seemed to be a particularly busy time, we were even more so impressed by the amazing customer service that we received. Tony went above and beyond to ensure that we had a wonderful visit. The Cheesecake Factory in the Forum Shops continues to be our favourite place to dine when we are visiting Las Vegas.",5
"Located at the far end of the Forum Shops, the food was really good and generous portions! The Godiva Cheesecake was simply divine! Great view of the aquarium and if you time it right, you can catch the Atlantis show on the top of the hour, every hour.",5
Amazing,5
The service could have been better overall the food is delicious,2
Good meal and very friendly staff. Everyone enjoyed their meals here. Definitely would go again,4
"The food was not as good this time and service was very slow. But, Im sure we will give them another chance maybe it was just an off day.",3
"Fantastic food, service and venue.",5
Ummm ummm good!,5
On point. Love me some Oreo Cheesecake.,4
"Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant to visit, they offer a huge selection of meals, and award winning cheesecake. Now this particular one in Las Vegas @ Caesars Palace, is always a must when I arrive in Vegas, its a first stop, not only because its my favorite restaurant, but it's because I always have a wonderful experience at this location, the staff is great, the cooks are great, and I always get right in, I don't remember waiting for more than 5 minutes to get seated. Its location is great, and its 2-stories. This location is a must visit! For those waiting to be seated you can always watch the fish swim in a big aquarium outside of the restaurant, or visit some nearby stores, like Nike. Thank you very much Cheesecake Factory for your outstanding service at each location I visit, and for the great food you offer.",5
Great food and dessert but we also had fantastic service from Juan... best service in the USA so far! We will definitely go back.,5
You can't go to las Vegas without a visit to the cheesecake factory. Cakes are to die for,5
Great food and service.,5
Great food and service,5
This was excellent!,5
"No happy hour, arguably the worst cheesecake factory I've ever been to.",1
"Very good meal. Pricing reasonable, especially considering the fact its in Ceasar's shopping mall. Minimal wait on a Saturday afternoon. Good service, good food. Nice atmosphere.",4
"great cheesecake, fun. environment",5
Had a wonderful time.,5
".Foods are always great in Cheesecake Factory .
But there are flaws along the way ....I order online and gave me the time for pick up..but when I got there,I still have to wait and go in line ,and there's an  unorganized line in picking up orders,/door dash delivery, etc
guest receptionist  not very helpful.",3
"This place is located inside the Shoppes at Cesar's palace and it's really good. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the employees are friendly. The food came out quickly and it was very delicious. My husband took me here for my birthday and when he told the waitress it was my birthday, she brought out a tiny bowl that had one scoop of ice cream, a few sprinkles, and drowning in whipped cream. The ice cream was gone in two scoops. Needless to say I was disappointed when they brought that puny thing out as the birthday dessert. It used to be a free slice of cheesecake. We ended up ordering two cheesecake slices to go.",3
Amazing place great food great prices I love this place.,5
"The best 21st birthday ever! Had visited this location on August 20th for my 21st birthday and everything was phenomenal!! William our server provided excellent service from beginning until end as well as the food was delicious as always! Also, my mom had asked what type of bread the darker brown one was and he brought us another basket full which was awesome. Had ordered a piece of the Godiva cherry chocolate cheesecake and it had ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate on the plate which made the desert appearance beautiful as well as the server sang to both my table as well as the table beside us at the same time as there were 4 birthdays at the other table; loved it! Thanks for an unforgettable experience and I will definitely be back!",5
Great location and wonderful food. Had the Korean cauiflower and beet salad.. unfortunately parking cost more than an entree...might think twice about going again as we were there less than 2 hours and it cost $15 for parking,5
Popped in for a snack ... Fall show was under repair,5
"Food was delicious, our waitress was so wonderful and attentive and the bathrooms were very clean.",5
Great food and service,5
"We arrived during the dinner rush. Our waitress was professional. My husband ordered the Steak Diane. After waiting a considerable amount of time, the kitchen manager came to explain what was taking so long. Because we had to wait longer, our meal was free, dessert, drinks, and all. Great atmosphere, food, service, decor, would return again.",4
"Food was great, server was awesome!  Stupid Civil",4
Best service we've ever gotten,5
It's so good that normally there is a little wait. The wait is worth it.,5
"Good food, waitress went MIA for a while but the place was empty..",4
"Service I've always found so so. Twice we had amazing service, once was really slow and very average. But all in all, would definitely come back. Portions are huge! Every time we go, we always say we will share a meal next time!",4
"We had dinner here, and not just cheesecake. They have a wide variety of choices, so my girlfriend had pasta and I had steak. Both were very good and it was good to have something else than burgers. Staff was friendly and took some time for a small chat. Good place to have good food.",4
"Our waitress was fantastic, food great, but the hostesses were extremely snotty to the point we almost left to eat somewhere else and we spent quite a bit of money! I would suggest hiring some new hostesses or teaching them how to interact with customers as we own our business also. The main snotty one was named Dinaris or Damaris. Something like that! Very rude!",3
Love the food and cheesecake,5
"I am not a chain restaurant fan. However this was a fantastic experience. James was the best waiter I have ever had. I was a waiter for years and really respect the work he put in. Additionally, he was funny and set the tone for our visit. The food is pricey but it's a huge portion for the normal menu. There is a a lighter menu that looks really tasty. The cheesecake was amazing. The atmosphere was cool. I think it's nicer than a normal Cheesecake Factory because it's in Caesars Palace. The cocktails are a bit to pricey for me. The prices not being listed was a turn off. All in all it was a good experience I would recommend to families and anyone else.",5
Wonderful experience. Great food and service. Big shout out to Eric who was amazing and very helpful.,5
"Great food, great service. Out waiter Robb was fantastic. We will definitely come back!",5
Delicious food 👍,4
Meatloaf was awesome,5
"Great place to eat. I love the pasta they do. Is quite crowded a dinner times, so you may need to wait around 10-30 minutes. But it is definitely worn it.",5
"Awesome restaurant best desserts in Vegas! Ordered appetizers and all very tasty, good prices, and great service! 5 stars!",5
Cheesecake factory is awesome,5
"Where do I start.  I guess they were to busy or understaffed to handle the big crowd.  It took 7 minutes and 12 seconds to get our drinks.

It's so dark in their restaurant, I know it supposed to be a romantic setting but I can't even see the facial expressions from the yperson sitting across from me.

We placed our food and appetizer order at 18:47.  We received our bread and butter at 18:56.  Our appetizer finally arrived at 19:28, just 2 minutes before our main course at 19:30.  I'm so glad we had ample time to scarf down our appetizer to enjoy dinner.

I tasted my daughter's dinner and I would have to say that Pizza Hut serves a better Chicken Alfredo.  On a positive note my dinner tasted really good.

We were going to stay and have some cheesecake but since everything else was taking so long I didn't want to take the chance and have it take forever to get out desserts.

This will be my first and last visit to The Cheesecake Factory.",1
Always good!,5
My friend inhaled the cheesecake she got to go.,5
"The main dishes here are really big and will get you so full that you probably will not be able to even finish a shared cheesecake for dessert. The cheesecakes are just amazing as always, and there is plenty of different cakes to choose from. The only reason this does not get five stars is the lack of routines at the mens restroom. There was a complete lack of any means of drying your hands. There was no paper towels there either at the start or the end of our visit, and at the last visit the soap dispenser was empty as well. This is basic stuff every restaurant need to have in order.",4
What can I say. Each location I go to no matter what state they food is fabulous.  Clean and sanitized.,4
"Waited 1/2 hour to be seated....no problem, we were expecting that wait. What we didn't expect was no service. Our server came by 5 minutes after we were seated to tell us she'd be right back. 15 minutes later there was no sign of her. We left due to lack of service.",1
"Always a pleasure and very good service. Some menu items are not top quality but in general the food is good. The decor is upscale and the prices are as well which  attracts a more affluent crowd. The bar is a highlight as there are many specialty drinks. Finally, very good deserts are a hallmark of the brand.",4
Delicious food.,5
Delish!,5
Best place hands down. Bread is amazing. Cheesecake is one of a kind,5
This is pretty much your average Cheesecake Factory. The service is not bad again considering you are on the strip and prices pretty fair. Service is always great which is a plus after having to deal with rude people on the strip. I would recommend this place if you have not already been to one before.,4
"Food was very good,  but salad and dressing did not arrive together; we had to wait so long the meals were already coming out. Dessert was wonderful,  as usual.",4
"My boyfriend works as a dishwasher there. And he would sometimes bring home your guys' food, enough for the both of us to share. So far, I've had... 1) an original cheesecake, 2) a white chocolate raspberry truffle, 3) some chocolate cheesecake, 4) a cheesecake that kinda tasted like coffee, 5) pepperoni flatbread pizza, 6) the club sandwich, & 7) chicken fingers (which are ""kinda"" my thing). And I loved all of them!! Btw, I'm not much of a coffee person, but I enjoyed that coffee cheesecake!",5
Delicious food at a decent price for vegas,5
Wonderful cheesecake.,5
Never had a bad meal at this restaurant,5
Good food. Decoration needs to be updated i all the restaurants. Food and service are good,4
Great service.,5
Great location in stoneridge shopping mall in Pleasanton. All varieties of food and a large variety of cheese cakes. Went to celebrate a Birthday.,4
Always good. Good portions good prices. Quaility of food is top notch. Would recommend and repeat.,4
"We came for a couple of pieces of cheesecake but the smell of a delicious pasta took us in for diner. Great pasta and the best cheesecakes. We had Hershey's chocolate cheesecake, red velvet cheesecake and an original cheesecake. all 3 where delicious!",5
"Amazing place to eat! Karen was our waitress. Great, friendly, fast  service. You get so much food for the price. Highly recommend",5
"I really enjoyed my meal here. It's located deep in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. We went on a Friday and had no wait for lunch. The atmosphere is nice as you can sit and watch the Atlantis Fountain show. Our waitress was great, food was outstanding. The cost, in comparison to many places on the strip, was almost reasonable. However if you're going to get a cocktail ask the price as they aren't listed and I paid $11 for an Old Fashioned. Will definitely go back next visit.",5
Our waitress Jasmin gave us the best service. She was friendly helpful and super professional. We loved the service and food so much we came multiple times in our stay in las Vegas. Food portion and ingredient quality are the best.,5
"Great food, service fast and friendly. Haven't a chance to try the cheesecake yet.",5
"Great place to get a salad that you know will not be overpriced. The salad I ordered was very healthy and huge. I didn’t expect it to be supersized. It was piled up like a volcano and it was fun to eat my way through the various layers.

The price was fair and the margaritas were well priced and yummy. I was satisfied with the value for the money for the dish I ordered.

The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to go if you know what dishes you like. It's not an exotic or creative menu but pretty consistent in quality, value and delivery based on my experience.",3
Very nice food and thanks for good services. Definitely will visit again.,5
"I ordered for pickup. My order was the veggie burger. I also wanted a turkey burger, but they said that they were out. When I arrived about 15 minutes later, my order was not complete. I was given half of the fried macaroni appetizer and I still had to wait almost 15 minutes before my order was done. I was given a refund for the half order of fried macaroni. When I called back about the veggie burger and how it was not up to par and looked/tasted like it wasn’t made correctly, I was told no refund would be given. I even still had the burger to return. I hope seated service is better",2
"Food was gross. Left most of my burnt steak (I ordered medium) and waitress didn't even mention it.

Fries were nice

Had a tower cake for dessert. Way too rich. Cream I think was spray cream.

Never left any steak behind before and love chocolate cake.

Asked for peppered sauce (to cover disgusting steak) got something that tasted like black bean sauce from a Chinese restaurant.

Can't believe it. The wife loved the one in Hawaii",1
Great food and service.,5
Our server was wonderful.  The food was sooo good (large portions - affordable). I would have given them 5 stars but we did wait quite a while to get our food. Will definitely return.,4
Good very nice 😘,4
Busy location. Had to wait half an hour for table. Huge food portions. Great cheesecake selection. Attentive staff. The only negative was my waitress placing my bill on the table before I even asked and felt rushed.,4
Our waiter was hands down awesome gave us the best advice 4 dinner options.. it was the first time eating there and the meals he recommended where the best meal that the whole Family ate enough 2 actually fill up and no one even asked 4 a late night snack because the portions are so big...Take ur Family there !!!!,5
Food was great!,5
The Cheesecake was just like I remembered.,5
"Always good, doesn't matter if is Las Vegas, Salt Lake, or another place, their food is really good.",5
"Worst food ever. You know when you go some place and its so bad it sticks in your mind forever??? That was this experience. Burger was raw. My dates food was horrible too. Server was not even around to fix any issues. We got drinks, ordered food and never saw her again until the check flew onto our super small very cramped and very very dark table. Do not go here unless you want to waste a large amount of time and get a meal you won't be able to eat. Next time I will just assume the meal is free and walk out...I shouldn't have to hunt down a manager if I can barely get a check from the wait staff",1
All the flavors are delightful.,5
Great food good service,5
Oreo cheesecake was amazing!,5
"This was hands down the best food we ate in Vegas. It was definitely worth the walking to get to, and although it was hard to find, the food was exquisite, along with the service. I will definitely eat there again any chance I get, and also will be looking into how I can get a restaurant put in locally where I live! We had several people in our party, so I was able to try a lot of different dishes, including my Southwest chicken sandwich, the Garlic noodles pasta dish with chicken, the meat loaf, and the fried zucchini was amazing as an appetizer.",5
"Fast, friendly service",5
Best Cheesecake Ever!!,5
Willing to accommodate our food changes. Outstanding flavor of Thai salmon with veggies. Merlot with prefect temperature which gave it a nice flavor. Server no knowledge of wine though and could not help us with alternatives. Long time to pay and we were late for our show.,4
"Every time my Wife and I are in Vegas, we always make a stop at this Cheesecake Factory because we are so impressed with it. The food is always delicious and hot, the wait time to be seated never takes too long and the atmosphere is fun and exciting. The waiters/waitresses we've had are always kind and take good care of us. I'll be returning every time I come to Vegas!",5
"Long lines, but what can we say? it's always full cause everyone loves it. Nothing to complain! Good food and service all times",5
"First time eating at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. We waited less than 10 minutes for a table.
Lots of different food to choose from.
Food quality was excellent! Nice size servings too. For the 3 of us we got 3 meals, 3 sodas and shared 1Godiva Chocolate Cheese Cake for $58. Very reasonable price for food on the strip.
Would definitely come back again!",5
So good rich,4
"Great customer service. Though our appetizer got dropped (and was the last ordered before closing), the manager came out and offered us free cheesecake for the inconvenience.",5
I love the Cheesecake Factory. Always great food and this one is in a beautiful place.,5
"The view is beautiful in the Caesar's Palace location, ask to sit near the aquarium show",4
The manager won't let the factory floor workers sleep,4
Calamari is great,5
Terrible food service was fine. The menu is to high price for the quality of the food.,1
"Great location in the Forum Shops in Caesars Palace, viewing a small aquarium which is not that good really. Environment and ambience is good but not as good as other branches in the country. Service was top notch, our waiter David was nice and helpful. Menu is good and with a good variety that will suit any palate. Prices are slightly above average. Food is average, nothing special really. If you're in the CityCenter and looking for a cheap (relatively) and familiar restaurant, look no further.",4
"This experience was terrible! We had a 45 minute wait to get in which I was fine with, but after we got in we had another hour wait for our food & kept having to grab our waitress just to get a refill on our drinks(tea & water) We then went ahead and got a cheesecake(let’s be honest that’s the only reason you come here) had to wait another 30 minutes  & my cousin asked for a coffee with it & didn’t get the coffee until she was almost finished with the cheesecake. By the time we finished we had spent 3 hours & all the shops were closed! Food was ok, cheesecake was good, but not worth the time we spent. I’ve been to different locations and had much better experiences....very disappointed in my visit at this location.",1
Great spaghetti.,5
"One of our favorite places to eat. While on vacation in Vegas we went three times! Great quality food, prices and staff!",5
"We had no wait time for a seat, which was fantastic.  That should have given us a hint about the food.  We passed Wolfgang Puck's restaurant to eat here.  Maybe we should have given Puck's a try.  We ordered from the lunch menu, and I had the Renee's special...soup, salad, and half a chicken salad sandwich.  The portion sizes were huge, which is standard here.  The soup was cold.  Cold potato soup is not appealing.  The choice of greens for the salad were mediocre and lettuce was limp.  The stand out was the sandwich.  I love their chicken salad.  Overall, the family found their food to be ""meh.""  One family member also had the Renee's special, one a burger, and another a salad.  Nothing to write home about.  :)  Next time, we're off to Puck's!  :)",3
Food was great  but the service that day was slow,4
"Very clean, great service and great food. The portions are big and you get what you pay for. Plus the free show right outside the restuarant makes it worth it to sit in their balcony section.",4
"Wait to get a table was supposed to be 20mins, but we got one faster then the estimated time. That was the last thing we had in a timely manner there. Drinks took a long time. We ordered an appetizer and shortly after were told that it wasn't available, had to order something else. Then we sat and waited, and waited. Got our appetizer which was alright. Then wait for the entree was insane. By the time it arrived I was so tired and bored from just sitting and waiting. I knew we were there for over two hours because we heard the neptune show twice.
The waiter was friendly, and a manager randomly apologized for the wait. But I would never go back. Such a waste of a friday night.",1
Love this place while i worked there and since i stopped working there friendly staff amazing menuselections something for everyone,5
"Chains can be hit and miss but we had a really good lunch.
Service prompt and courteous and surprisingly reasonably priced for something in Caesars.",5
"Wow. Just wow. Get the caramel milkshake! it is gorgeous. Had a wonderful main course here - chicken, mozzarella and mushroom sauce with peppered mash and greens. Delightful! VERY filling! Very good value for money on the strip. Will definitely be back here.",5
"Overall the experience was not good. I work at the Forum Shops, so the long wait for a table was no surprise. Unfortunately the food I ordered wasn't even correct and by the time they fixed it my other food was cold. Bread didn't even get to the table til after our entrees arrived. No manager around either. Also, our server literally never checked on us. It look 10 minutes just to get someone's attention to get my order corrected. Overall the experience was not good and I more than likely wont return. The experience was frustrating and does not excite me to return.",1
Customer service was the only thing that was good.,1
Service here was horrible for me.. from being seated to getting our food just bad all around. It took forever for our food to come.. it took so long we wanted to cancel but couldn't because the server took forever to come back!!! After we got our food the server never came to check on us!!! We had to ask for our bill multiple times!!! And had to wait 15 mins for him just to come get the  bill!!,1
This location is the best location I’ve ever been to. It is very clean and the service was amazing! The quesadilla was to die for! Hands down the best I’ve ever tasted. Thank you for an amazing experience!,5
Great food good service!!!,5
Great customer service and food,5
"Great place for dinner. The food is usually quite good and the selection is rather large. We went here after getting to know the place through Big Bang Theory and weren't disappointed. There is usually a bit of wait though, so we don't come here very often.",4
Everything you want and more. Make sure you split food. Most meals can serve 2 people. Or you can take home 1/2,5
Cheesecake here is always top tier! Cheers to the chef,5
Fantastic meal. Ordered 2 starters and a dessert to share and it was enough for 2 people and I'm a big eater. Unlimited drinks refills is a huge plus. Great service and decent price.,5
Greatest Shepherd's Pie!!,5
Great 👍,5
Minimum 45 minute wait.  Food was exactly as it should be and service was fantastic!,3
"My favourite restaurant in Vegas! Food is incredible!
We had a really nice server too!",5
The food was awesome and the staff was so nice.,5
"Good food, good drinks and great deserts. Service was great as well as the atmosphere.",5
Great tasting food like always,5
"Great food and service,
Loved the time and the price.",5
front desk staff are quite miserable -,2
"It was so busy but they are so efficient that we got a table pretty fast! And the service was amazing and didn't have to wait forever for food. And to top it off, food was delicious 🤤",5
This is a great value in Las Vegas. Food was great and the desserts were awesome. Staff extremely friendly. Heading back again this trip.,5
"Just Delicious, all Around!",5
Awesome cheesecake!,5
"Slow service, decent food from a massive menu! Garuntee you'll find something everyone likes,l. Just don't expect it to be amazing quality. Don't get me wrong not saying it's bad, it was acceptable.",3
The Cheesecake Factory at Caesars Palace is the best one I have been to. The service and food was great!,5
Always Great Service,5
Really good food. Sizes are large so get a lunch size because you will need to try some cheesecake and those pieces are huge.,4
Long wait for eat and they aren’t organized,1
Great service,5
"We had amazing experience during our visit here, we got our food in less than 20mins. Food was very delicious and our server was very friendly & helpful.",5
Very friendly service food was delicious,5
"I'm very disappointed I came to eat at the Cheese Cake factory for my bday, and my dinner was ruined. I wonder how clean is this restaurant it is in Casears Palace and I expected more of the place being more clean, but no when I first got my drink there was some black stuff in the glass it was dirty. Then when my food came there was this black flying bug flying all around it out of no where and my food was cold, I ended up talking to the manager and he wanted to see the bug that i killed I put it in napkin. My friend was still eating her food and she was upset because he opened it in the middle of the table. I just felt so discussed with this place I'll never come back to this location.",1
The menu here is enormous!  Cheesecake selection is great and yummy!  I've never had a bad meal or experience here!,5
Delicious cheese cake and friendly staff. I would definitely recommend this place as serving the best cheesecake ever. There is a huge choice.,5
"Best experience ever. Our server, Kryzia R, was so attentive and kind. She made this meal so enjoyable. Food was amazing! Loved the avocado egg rolls.",5
Great food and service!,5
"Food was mediocre at best,  the service was horrible. Don't waste your time or your money.",1
The bathroom had very nice stone tiling and a calm atmosphere. Catchy tunes played in the background while my lovely dinner of salmon and potatoes made its way out. 10/10 would poop in again,5
"Of all the CCF locations in Vegas, this is by far the worst. Nothing is consistent between visits except for the low quality food. Over priced and underwhelming. I used to come often as I work in the area but over the last year, things have really gone downhill. The final straw: on my most recent visit, I ordered a side of rice to go but after 20 minutes I was still waiting and walked out. Do yourself a favor and go to a different location if you REALLY want Cheesecake Factory.",1
Great food and service! Enjoyed the burger and a glass of wine with the chocolate cheese cake.,5
"My boyfriend and I came to Las Vegas in February/March 2010. I raved about the cheesecake factory in Chicago and told him we had to go to the one in Las Vegas because he had never been to this restaurant ever. First off, yes Caesar's Palace is HUGE however, finding where the cheesecake factory was nearly impossible if you hadn't been in this place before. Not only that but the wait for dinner was huge, but the host told us to stand aside and we would be one of the next one's to be seated. We stood there and watched as other party of 2's that had been standing behind us were being seated before us! Very unorganized and disappointing start to our experience. I finally went up and told the host that we had been waiting before other groups, as well as another couple were were standing there before us, who were also mad. When I confronted the host, I was polite but she was a complete snob to me. We were finally seated at a cramped table, and our server took forever to come to our table. The food was good but service was definitely a let down and put a bad taste in our mouth about the whole thing. I love the Cheesecake Factory everywhere but Las Vegas, someone needs to get some control over the customer service here!",3
Best food in Las Vegas. Hands down!,5
Amazing service with a surprisingly 26 pages menu,5
"Amazing food, but be ready for a walk.... This is all the way in the back of the Forum Shops, and you're looking at least at a 15-20 minute walk to get there. On the plus side, it lets you work off a good bit of your meal on the way out...",4
I gave it 2 stars because of the front of the house. We sat at our table for 15 minutes before even being acknowledged. Asked for a manager and one never showed up.  Took another 10 minutes to get drinks.   We ordered and after about an hour sitting there we finally got our food. Opened the silverware and the spoon was stuck to the fork. Finally got a new set after tracking down or server.  Now the food was all on point and great.  After a hour and a half of sitting there we finally got to leave.   Like I stated the service was horrible but the food was great.,2
"Food is always good, service is always excellent and prices are reasonable.",5
"Told a 40 minute wait, it's been over an hour now and still no table. We have 5 children and a pregnant woman and sounds like we still have to wait another 30 minutes. Employees have been nice but, waiting an hour for food is crazy but, we're vested at this point, the food better be good or we will never eat at The Cheesecake factory again.",1
"Not my favorite location because of its set up. This restaurant is literally hidden in the back of Ceaser’s Palace. That is was a very long walk for me (15 minutes). The directory signs did not really help me being the Ceaser’s Palace is so big. The restroom is hard to find but is located up stairs. That doesn’t seem easy accessible a handicap person. This location also has a dark feel.

The restaurant should have been located near the main entrance to the mall with a separate entrance and windows. That is how the most locations are set up. Sometimes, people just want to dine and not shop.",2
The four cheese pasta was amazing I would definitely recommend it,5
"The food seemed great while we were there.  It was honestly some of the best salmon I've ever had.  However, before we even got back to the casino where we were staying, I began feeling sick.  Without going  into detail, I spent a large portion of the remainder of the night in the restroom.  The last thing I ate before that was just packaged snack food and it was about 6 hours prior. The only alcohol I had was a single sip of my girlfriend's long island iced tea.  This was my first time eating at The Cheesecake Factory and I really wanted to like it.  I did while we were there, but the consequences after definitely ruined my impression.",1
"Great location with all the fun and entertainment around.
The drinks and food were great too, including the espresso (quality of espresso isn’t always what you want in these busy places)
Staff was super friendly!
TIP: plan your visit in a way you get to see the show (check times)",5
Steak Diane is my go to,5
"Good food, good portions, decent price. This location had good ambience with a statue show outside that plays every hour. Also has bomb Oreo cheesecake",5
Was told a long wait. But somehow they seated us before others who arrived before us. Great service and food. Good first experience of Cheesecake Factory. Will return to another of not this one again.,4
Good food good service,5
"Wow, very yummy 😋",5
"Delicious! After a long day of shopping, there's no better way to relax than a big piece of cheesecake! You might want to consider sharing a piece with a friend/spouse/child. I had a hard time finishing my own piece.",5
"Red velvet cheesecake....
Amazing!!!",4
Our favorite place,5
"Good food, good cheese cake, very busy place. Great service and atmosphere, but your pocket book will be a little lighter.",4
"My favourite place to eat every time I am visiting the US from Canada. Every time I'm in Vegas, I usually eat a few meals here. Great food, reasonable prices, and good service.",5
"My parents went to this particular Cheesecake location in early December. When they left, my mom realized that she left her cell phone there but couldn't go back because they were already in California. They called and asked them if they could possibly mail the phone back to Irvine, and they did. Not only did they go above and beyond when it came to their lunch and service, but to do something like that was incredible.",5
Great as usual at cheesecake factory. I dont think I've been to a CF and the food or service has been bad. 👍👍,5
We eat here every time we go to Vegas - some of the most reasonable food on the strip while still having great quality and selection.  There is a bit of a wait time but that's a sign of a good restaurant.  We make it a point of going at least once every time we're in town.,5
"Terrible service. Im sorry a steak doesnt take over an hour to cook, this place is a joke, its Caesars palace ffs have a tiny bit more professionalism would you?",1
"Eveything was great. The service started slow but, ince the food came the lady was very attentive.",5
Nice service and great food! Very noisy though... Gluten free options available and that is perfect for us as we have a child with gluten intolerance.,4
Good service and the food was delicious,5
Nice place the food always give me agita,3
"It is a good place if you want some big portions and a reasonable price.  Depending on how hungry you are, you may want to share your main course.  Had the burrito and it was great.",4
The shrimp scampi was excellent!!!,5
Food is aaaaaaaaa,5
Not my thing. Even the cheesecake was just so so.,3
"So many Great choices and EVERYTHING is good.

This is as good problem to have.",5
"Can't complain, its cheesecake",3
"Our server was the best he checked on us often and really try to please us. I ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato fries it was so good I woke up and ate the rest of what I didn't finish. I also got the avocado egg rolls with a Georgia peach all so good. My step mom got the rice and chicken but said the rice was dry but the chicken was good, she never ate the rice... My dad got the tex mex egg rolls with clam chowder soup he said they both were really good. We all had a great time and was pleased with our waiter.",5
An awesome place to eat and the food is excellent.,5
Awesome experience....turkey dinner was marvelous,5
"The food is delicious and the store next door has a fabulous ""Welcome to Las Vegas"" for some souvenir photos.",5
Excellent service - Paula was awesome. Very attentive to our needs. Food prep was fast. Drinks were always full. Friendly servers and host.,5
"Great, Great Great!!! We had 12 in our party and they took care of us as if there were only two.  Will be back again.",5
Love it please don't go..,5
"This Cheesecake factory has a very different taste as compared to the other Cheesecake factory outlets. I generally have the Louisiana pasta or the Spicy Chipotle pasta, but both the pastas that I had here were thinner and not the same taste as other outlets of Cheesecake factory.
Avocado egg rolls, though, were yummy as usual.",4
Red velvet cheesecake was awesome,5
"Great food, great service, they took care of a tablemate's complaint quickly and painlessly",5
Great service and food.,5
"Nice, tasty, people were really nice to us. Price is good.",5
Was great,5
Yeah the food was great the service was good,5
"Okay but not great.

- Unfocused menu with too many options.
- Taste left us without any hard feelings. Given the size of the menu you might find better options than the ones we had if you are lucky (quesadillas & avocado toast).

Considering the low prices this is good value for Vegas.",3
"Nothing beats their cheesecakes and they have more to offer like pasta, steak etc!",5
Good  food and service,5
Cheese 🍰 cake....best,5
We come here every time we come to Vegas.  The food is always excellent and we haven't had bad service yet after about 20 meals here.,5
Great Food. Plenty of it. Great service always comes with a smile.,5
"Friendly service
Good was OK",5
"Honestly I Like their food, but the atmosphere made me sleepy and want to go home.",3
Visited during pandemic. Food was up to Cheesecake Factory standards.,4
"Terrible, the worst experience I've ever had in my life across the US.  Whenever I traveled to the US I always had great treatment at the chain restaurants, but this time was the worst.  we arrived and asked for a table for 5 people, bos gave 15 minutes wait, we waited 1h, when we got the long table 2 friends arrived and wanted to have dinner with us, we asked to change the table and the waiter said i would have to go back to  Reception and ask for another table.  My friends arrived we all sat at a table of 5 extremely tight people.  A friend asked to talk to the manager he made the smallest case, said he would put us on another table, but not 7 seater, put us on another 5 seater table as tight as, my friends had no space to eat and  My birthday was destroyed right on the first day of the year.  thanks for nothing Cheesecake Factory.",1
Not sure if it's because this location is extra busy or not but the food isn't the best.  Their bread normally is great but the last few times it was pretty tough.  Hard to chew and it wasn't even warm.  The chicken on my pasta was all burnt too.  Service was only decent.  I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory that is like this before.,3
Always great,5
Great as always,5
"We went there two days in a row. It was delicious both times. The service was also really good.

Pizza: B
Steak: A-
Chicken Madeira: A
Mashed Potatoes: A+
Cheesecakes: A++

Would definitely recommend. Ask for a table in the back of the restaurant, cause there is a hourly statue show at Caesers Palace, which is nice seeing for the first time, but quite annoying while you eat.",5
"Lovely food, great portion sizes (if not a little bit too much), good quality, reasonable prices and nice atmosphere. Absolutely huge selection of cheesecakes cannot decide which one is best!! :-) Visited the Cheesecake factory chain on many occasions and have never had an issue with the food at any of them.",5
Good place to eat.,5
It was ok the waitress was the bomb but the food was so  so🙁.,3
"Absolutely horrible service. The hostesses are rude and could care less about service. The waitress we had took over 10 minutes just to come ask if we wanted to order a drink to start. It would be understandable if the restaurant was busy however, it was very slow and the servers were just chatting it up laughing with each other. Choose another place unless you enjoy horrible service.",1
Great food  poor service . Waited 25 minutes to be seated which was ok. Was busy.  Waitress took our drink orders and brought them to our table and got 2 drinks mixed up.  Ordered our food . There was 4  of us. Other waiter bought 2 of us our food . Waited 2 minutes for 3 order. Waited another 5 minutes to get 4 order. The fourth order was wrong and missing potatoes.  And steak was not cooked they way we ordered. Sent it back and by the time we got 4th order again the others were done eating.  And still had to wait for the potatoes.,1
Finally had to walk out without eating. My meal never came even after about four visits from my server apologizing for the wait. Think I waited about 45 minutes maybe longer.,1
Great food,5
Good food,5
Nice place to eat,4
"Was waiting 35 minutes today and when the waiter bring us to our table we saw the cutleries (pork knife & spoon) all set on the table was really dirty seems like no one working there check the table or what they will put on the table are clean or dirty. Fell so bad for the big restaurant such a cheese cake factory have that kind of service, luck of cleanest. So we decide to went out and inform the girl was standing outside. Its our bad day maybe .",1
My first time eating here at the Las Vegas location and boy was I blown away! Steak was made to order and the shrimp were fresh! Great atmosphere not loud and not too crowded,5
I love this place.,5
It's the cheesecake factory always good.,5
Never been there.,1
Just stopped in for dessert.  Cheesecake was delicious with plenty of varieties to choose from.  Service was excellent as well.,5
"Very fresh and super tasty food, one of the best Cheesecake Factory restaurants in the US!",5
"My boyfriend and I got here at about 8pm. First of all, we got seated pretty quick which was satisfying. Right away we knew exactly what we wanted and ordered. Our waitress was rude, extremely dull, and honestly poorly trained. We've bee here about 6 times and have never been so disappointed. Around 840 the manager comes to our table to tell us one of the things we ordered they were sold out of. Mind you we've already been waiting 20-30 minutes. That was fine we order something else instead. Immediately after the manager leaves our waitress arrives with 1 of the dishes we ordered. Seriously? Who wants to eat alone? Anyway we eat that while waiting for the 2nd dish to come out. At 915pm it's finally here and not cooked as we ordered. So we ask to speak to the manager (which was different from the first one) told him briefly what happened he takes the steak we wait yet another 10 minutes for it to come back. It's 936pm and my boyfriend only now got his food. 1hr and 36 minutes after arriving. Very disappointing.",1
"Could a restaurant be any better?
Perfect steak, probably the best I ever had for a small price.
Just amazing",5
Absolutely delicious,5
"I wish that this location is able to improve the following:

1. Reservations: the waiting time promised was 40 mins. 1 hour later, the table was still not ready. I came to the front to get an update about my reservation and the latina hostess showed disinterest in her job by interacting with guest in an unwelcoming way such as not apologizing for the long wait, seemed irritated/snobby, flat speech, and no eye contact.

2. Waiter: did not offer any bread or butter, water, or any beverage refills. The female waiter was inattentive and seemed to care more about her hair flinging on the side.

3. The food: the plating of the 3 pasta dishes we ordered looked very different from the usual presentation such as no fresh herbs, no fried basil, ect. My waitress did not offer any grated cheese. The steak had no steak knife. The supposed to be chicken parmessan had soggy, sauce-drenched mushy exterior. The cheesecake had no syrup and plated unusually.

The service and quality have diminished severely that we are not looking forward to going back to this location.",2
"As always the food was great, staff was great, even in Vegas...",4
"This location gets busy and we waited in line for like 30 minutes but it was worth it. The service was really good, the menu is vast... portions HUGE (share a plate), the cocktails were nice... sadly didn't have the space for cheesecake.",4
Good food,5
Really Good food and really Good personal that Jeeps refilling our glasses. Sad tho that I got so much food i could not est the whole cheesecake.,5
👍,4
Just had dessert this time... but always good food!,5
Really good meal and right beside the aquarium and Zeus show can't go wrong!!,4
"Absolutely poor organization. We had a reservation for a birthday at 4pm . Management failed us . We are still waiting . Spoke to manager and the manager never returned . We are left to fend for ourselves . Poor poor poor . I can’t comment on the food because we got none .  Disgusted , hungry and disappointed is all I can say and it’s too late to try to find an alternative for all our family that made it here to attend this 90th birthday celebration. Thank you management 🤬",1
Awesome meal .....won't have to eat for a week...!!!,5
i have been eating in cheesecake factories since they opened in beverly hills in the eighties. i have been to at least 10 across the country i always find the food delicious and the service  excellent. we eat there several times a year. we enjoy the atmosphere.,5
We were able to get a table right away even though there was a huge crowd around right after watching the moving statues show. The food and service are just OK. It's rather noisy environment. Not a good place to have a relaxing lunch.,3
Great food for a reasonable price..... super friendly service,5
"Well, actually were two slices. Delicious slices of Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake and one of Key Lime Cheesecake for me and my wife. They were so big, we left full and went for a 5mile run only to kill the calories of one slice :)
We went by 15pm and had to wait in line for more than 15 minutes for a table. It worth it. Next time, 3 slices for me! And a 15 mile run afterwards.",4
Long wait but always good.,5
"The food was unremarkable. The drink I ordered was severely lacking in alcohol and was comprised of 90% ice. We waited almost 10 minutes before a sever approached the table to take our drink order, but at that point we where already ready to order everything, this seemed to throw our waiter off.  At the very end I mentioned I had $100 (two $50 gift cards that I purchased through AMEX). I purchased them as e-gift cards and to redeem I just had to write down the numbers for my sever. I explained the above to him and then headed to the bathroom. It was a filthy poorly lit safety hazard. One stall was covered in fecal matter and urine. After running out of the bathroom I learned my sever could not use the e-gift cards stating he needed the physical copy. Knowing this to be false I asked for a manger. The woman who then approached our table did not seem thrilled. I then attempted to explain to her the issue. She then took my phone and tired it again. 5 minutes later our sever returns telling us we are all set. He accidentally tried to run them though as a Amex credit card. No apology from the manger.... Will not return.",2
"Food came out without the potatoes, so was given a delicious dessert for free. Ordered steak medium rare but it was overlooked and slightly burnt.",4
"Great food and not bad priced as usual, cannot go wrong",5
We have had breakfast with them and also an evening meal the food is really nice and at an affordable price.,5
The best..,5
Telling people there’s a wait when there’s empty tables outside. Pathetic. Plenty of other places to eat at the strip. This is one I won’t be bothering with again.,1
Very clean nice customer service,5
"Good food at a reasonable price. The service is good. The menu offers an extensive list of foods, including pasta, pizza, seafood, steak and deserts.",5
Our server (George) made the experience extra special. It was my friends birthday and he took extra care to make sure she was happy :) I would recommend eating light to save room for dessert.,5
Great food but a bit to loud and wait was long. Service was good though.,4
Fantastic place for a desert with a wide variety of choice and of excellent quality.  The statues outside were also very interesting and if you're there longer enough you'll see a show!,5
"Mac&Cheese Burger - fantastic.
Always busy, but the wait is never that long. Service is good, food is massive and super tasty.
The Caesar show thing every 30 minutes is distracting after a while, probably the only downer.
Highly Recommended.",5
Really good food and really good service!,5
Food was great as usual and the service was fantastic!,5
"Our waitress was amazing, the food was good and had a great time. Best service we’ve had anywhere in Las Vegas.",5
If you like cheesecake and slot of food in any holtels there games you can relax and enjoy your day,4
Food and location was good but... it was too much food. Usually that's a good thing but I don't like to trow as many food away. Also I didn't have room for dessert!,3
"Everything about this place was superb, could not fault it at all. Brilliant",5
"The food was fantastic. Staff were incredibly patient and helpful.

I would gladly dine here again.",5
"Fun, clean, attentive & courteous...",5
Devil's cheesecake is AMAZING,5
"Waited over 30 minutes for soft drinks, after 3 random waiters still no food after an hour. Ended up leaving, it should also be noted there were quite a few empty tables so I don't understand what the deal was.",1
Nice. Somewhat pricey and always very noisy. But The food is very good.,3
Lost half of our order and the fish was dry.,2
Nice cheesecake factory in Ceasars forum shops. Great service. It might take a while to get seated but all is good after that.,4
"Great menu, alot to choose from. Good service food was good. Prices were really reasonable.",5
Always excellent food and staff,5
Good food.  Nice experience this time around.,4
Beautiful inside.,5
Recommend you to visit,5
"Food was good, and so was the service when in the restaurant!

However, I believe I left something at the restaurant by mistake and I've just rang and told them the situation, just to be put on 'hold' for 25 minutes!

And because I'm from the UK the call charges are ridiculous over here!

So now I've probably got a ridiculous phone bill and still have no idea if they have the item I left

Not pleased.",3
Great place to eat.  Sizes are perfect,5
ok,4
Great place to go,5
"The carbonation was not working so no sodas, I ordered the strawberry lemonade and it was like 1000% sugar I almost had a panic attack from my blood sugar spiking.  Should have just had water.
The smokehouse burger is awesome.  The spinach artichoke dip is great too.",4
"Tried this in Vegas, wonderful service on our first visit, loved it, portions are massive and the cheesecake is heavenly",5
Quite simply the best cheesecake. We shared a lemon raspberry cheesecake that was light and the perfect balance of lemon & raspberry which came through the cheesecake flavour and wasn't overly sweet.,5
Food disgusting in caesers hotel. We went to the one in the outlets and it was lovely,1
Awesome service excellent,5
"My husband and I along with his parents eat here every single time we come to Las Vegas. We usually go for lunch. However, yesterday we decided to go for dinner. It took two hours to get our food. Two managers came to our table to apologize. My FIL chicken enchiladas were hard and chewy and my MIL roasted chicken was cold. The only thing we got back was a free piece of cheesecake for dessert after the meal and that took 30 minutes to get to the table itself. The managers were really very friendly. And they apologized continuously. But I wish we had gotten our money back on the food. The longest we've ever had to wait was 30 minutes for our food. 40 at most. But this was just bad.",3
Very nice place,5
Great food,5
Never a disappointment!!,5
"This location has the most consistently awesome food and service of any Cheesecake Factory location! The portions are great, the food is always delicious and cooked perfectly (especially the Chicken Bellagio), and the staff are friendly and know what they’re doing! Even though there’s one about 20 minutes from our home (SLC, Utah - the SLC location is just kind of meh)... every time we hit Vegas, we make time to stop here! Well done, Caesar’s Palace Cheesecake Factory!",5
"Considering the location and quality of food, the price is very respectable.",5
"It was pretty good! We didn’t have to wait long for a table..maybe 5-10 minutes? Our server was a bit MIA towards the end but the food almost made up for it lol. The bread and the warm crab and artichoke dip was amazing but the Chicken Bellagio was too plain and didn’t have enough flavor. The steak was good, green beans were just okay, and my teriyaki chicken was pretty good but my rice was ruined because the cook poured pineapple juice all over the plate and the rice just sucked that right up and made the rice taste like pineapple. 🥴",3
Good food.,4
Prices for food are bit on the high side but the cheese cake was good.,3
Taste great. Nice servers.,5
"Great service, great good, great price!  Not cheap but you will get what you paid for and more.  Best place to eat and the strip.",5
Love the atmosphere!  Love the food!,5
"Best place to go eat in vegas if you ask me. The food is really delicious. The size is really large so best is if you go eat that you take the cheesecake to go and enjoy the delicious cheesecake later at home (these is what i did)
If you pass cesars palace you have to go to the Cheesecake Factory",5
Always great.,5
"Great food, good portions, good service!",4
"Save your time and money with this location. Apart from the subpar service I received, I also received an unwashed cup and plate.",1
Great service!,5
"I love the food at Cheesecake Factory!  The service is excellent here as well, the environment is really noisy though with the Atlantis show going on just outside the restaurant.  Great food and service, but the location is horrible!",3
"Amazing cheesecake, but a little too expensive.",4
Great waiters,5
This place is excellent for a romantic dinner. Great service great food and it’s not as expensive as you would think,5
A really big selection to choose from for both food and cheese cake. Food was good.  Service was a little slower than expected.  I would go back.,4
"Service is great here, really like our server . It must be tough to translate so many languages! However, I was very disappointed in that I specifically asked the hostess if they had the Ahi Tuna and was told they did and, after ordering, I was told they were out of the tuna. This was the sole reason I wanted to eat here. Do you know how long of a walk it is through Ceasar's Palace? We were in Seattle just last week and the Cheesecake Factory was out there too. What is up with the tuna shortage???",3
"Very good cheesecake variety of 100 kinds
Lot of choices to eat almost everything
Food is tasty
Located at ceasr hotel
Recommended testurant
Prices are reasonable",4
"Great food and the workers are amazing, always smiling giving 110%",5
Perfect dinner in every aspect!,5
Had delicious jambalaya and service.,5
Out and out lied about things from New year's Eve night. Absolutely worst birthday I ever had.,1
Food great ... reasonably priced .. good service,5
"Liked it quite a lot! Nice atmosphere and tasty food. Service was good, and of course the cheese cakes are delicious!",4
Great food and great service. Our server Brent w was absolutely amazing. He always went far out of his way to keep us happy. He even noticed we loved the bread and gave us TWO FREE baguettes to take home. I will always make sure to come to cheesecake factory and ask for Brent W everytime we go to vegas. THANKS AGAIN BRENT!!!!!!!!,5
"Looooong waiting time for food with the kids, no clean look and feel regards forks, knifes, plates. Several delays in delivery of a standard club sandwich...all friendly service cannot Cover that the best days of Cheesecake Factory might been gone",3
Unable to deliver on request for service to simply butterfly shrimp per waitress was clear on being unable to deliver on request prior to asking chef. I would not suggest anyone whom has a desire for food to be cooked a certain way to indulge in an experience at this location. How can someone tell me how my food is to be prepared if I an used to having it made a in to particular taste. It takes 3 seconds to slice the shrimp completely up the middle.,1
Too pricy.,1
"Club sandwich and it was good, service was ok compare to other times but its understandable on peak times, however its always good to have lunch or dinner here, the service is very good",5
Had hard time ordering through drive thru. It took us awhile talking to the crew.,2
"Avoid salads... Lot of green and no enough sauce (and no additional) if was big and so dry, no taste... 60$ for 2 salads and 2 soda. But all the pasta are greats. Also it is located in the Atlantis place of the ceasare forum, that is very loudy, dark, cold and outdated...
I do not recommend this Cheesecake Factory.
Try the other one outside the North Premium Outlet that is better, in case you go shopping.",3
"The service was great,  the food was even better",5
Very friendly staff and the food was great!,5
"You've been to one, you've been to them all",4
Food came before the drinks,2
Very good and the waitress was great.,5
We had a Lovely meal in this establishment on Tues 12th Feb and took our cheesecake back to our hotel to eat. It was delish. My problem was with our server Johnathon who took our order and then passed us on to Joseph. We thought he had maybe finished for the day but the whole time we were at the restaurant he was serving tables around us!!! This left bewildered!! Did we do something wrong or was there a problem?,3
Great grilled salmon and even better cheesecakes. Yummy.,5
Awesome,5
"Amazing experience and higher standard of service than other CH branches, very delicious food and friendly staff. Dont miss it",5
Cheese cake was good and staff was also good.,4
Food is always amazing. Love love love it,5
"Good service, amazing food, and the cheesecake is everything you'd hope for here.",5
"Being long time fans of the Cheesecake Factory, we had to visit their Las Vegas location. It was a long walk from Ceasars' main entrance, but worth it as it was about 3pm when we got there and as we'd skipped lunch, we were hungry. We were a group of six and they set up a table for us in about 5 minutes. Our server was very pleasant and we all had coffee, a snack (I had baked potato tots & dip which I enjoyed) and cheesecake of course. No surprises here as we were all confirmed Cheesies. Btw, there's space to park your mobility scooter keeping it in view while dining.",4
Good,4
"Horrible service, never got appetizer that was ordered.  Forgot the bread. Had to wait for refills. Very dissatisfied.  Food took forever too. Being Vegas, you would expect alot better!",1
Food was great...,5
Amazing,5
We were kept waiting two and a half hours after the time that we were told to be there for a party of 14 for a 4 year old's birthday party the manager did try to recover and provided some free applies.. .. waitress was great the manager was great the assistant manager or whatever he was should be fired he was rude and officious to a ridiculous point,1
Very bad experience we felt not welcome there and the manager wasn’t  professional  at all dealing with costumers!,1
Not sure didn't stop by more is great place,3
"Great food, pleasant staff.",5
"Amazingly elegant restaurant situated deep inside Caesars palace.
Worth a visit. Good food, friendly staff.",5
"Been to other CF's elsewhere with average results. Seemed expensive for a very average food, so I went in skeptical. The Steak Dianne was one of the top 10 dishes of my life! Blown away!! My wife's lemon chicken dish was also a top 10! I stole several bites.",5
I have eaten here many times.  The food is always good.  The price to portion ratio is fair and the service is good.,4
Best Food!,5
Penny the best waitress in the world 👍❤️,5
Service by the bartender was great. The food was great with the exception of the celery that came out with the buffalo blast.  The cook should have been ashamed of the white wilted celery that was on the plate.,4
"Service tends to vary quite widely per server, but the food has always been great, regardless of the choice. This location is rather unique, as its placement in Ceasars Palace allows one to seat looking out on the Forum. This part in particular is interesting for its hourly animatronic play, which takes place above a 360 degree aquarium. If you prefer a quiet meal, it's best to sit inside, away from the foot traffic and show.",4
We've been sitting here for well over an hour. All the tables around us have come and gone and new customers have filled them again. The waitress hasnt so much as apologized for our late food or offered any kind of compensation even though she's the one serving everyone else and knows we've been waiting. Such poor service!! Its ashamed because the food is good. There goes my husband's birthday dinner. Dinner was ruined.,2
Cheesecake Factory's are pretty nice places to have a lunch. Still take some tome to wait with you.,5
We went to cheesecake factory in Vegas December 27-30  allways love the food,5
"Great atmosphere, and really enjoyed the cheesecake!",5
"I have had the worst breakfast here. I asked for scrambled eggs well done (basically dry) and the came out runny barley cooked. I also got the potatoes and they were missing bell pepper and onion that I was told comes in them and they were burnt, couldn't put my fork through half. I have a fear to send things back so I ate my ham told my waitress about my problem very nicely and assured her that I know its not her fault but just wanted to let her know. I didn't even get a sorry. To top it off nothing was taken off my bill even though I didn't eat over half of what I ordered. I have worked in the forum shops for 10 years and everyday I recommend Cheesecake Factory this will stop and I won't blast them randomly but if a customers asks if its any good (frequent question BTW) i will let know what happen to me.",1
Awesome food. Not super spendy. Crazy busy though.,5
A wonderful food and service,5
"Food for all diets, atmosphere is inspiring and the food is actually really good; dessert, forgetaboutit. Go eat and then walk it off shopping in the mall. Looking forward to the Sunday brunch and football at the bar.",5
Great Restaurant I love it!,5
Always good,4
This is a extremely busy location; it took about an hour to get a table and once we were seated it took longer than usual to get service. The food was great and the staff were pleasant.,4
Happy to be able to enjoy this place in Vegas. - @MARIOONASSIS,5
"Normally I love the Cheesecake Factory.  But this one badly overcooked the food. Cook has a fine future in the funeral industry, operating a crematorium.",2
"Aside for waiting outside for 35 minutes, the food was delicious snd came fairly quick, Danielle, our waitress was pleasant and accomodating of all our special request, so all in all great dining experience. Will definitely come back ;)",4
Over priced but delicious the desserts are what they are famous for but the entrees and appetizers are excellent but you do pay a premium because of the location and there is always a bit of a waite .,4
Follow the cheesecake factory concept but for me it's one of the most mess place. Good food with a reasonable price.,3
"The food and service were great, we didn't even wait as long as we thought we would.  I just think it's kind of pricey for the type of food.",4
Great cheese cake,5
Great menu choices and good value,5
Nicely,5
Exquisite👍 love it!!!,5
The staff here was pretty nice. The server suggested the skinny enchiladas to me and I hated it so they changed the dish for me right away without complaint! :D luckily its so close to my office so I can hop in for lunch with my co workers whenever I'm in town.,5
So very good and the service was great too!!,5
Really good food and personal touch for our anniversary,5
Got Steak Diane and it was delicious 👌 Has nice view of the aquarium.,5
Good service friendly people,5

Yummy Cheesecake.  Food is good. Cheesecake is better,4
The wait service was great and the food wonderful,5
Went here for desert one night and our waitress was awesome! She made sure we were well taken care of!,5
Besides the hair in my nachos the crappy service and the crab they told me that wasn't in my wantons but apon further questioning their was crab. I am deathly allergic to shellfish.,1
Food and service was terrific! Didnt even have to wait a couple hours at the line up.,5
Not to happy with my visit at all smh...,1
"Lots of great food. Large portion sizes and tasty appetizers, alongside a huge and delicious selection and friendly staff make this a great restaurant to go to.",5
"Great dining area on the Strip! Prompt service, good food and reasonable price! Will be back again!",5
Nice,5
"One hour of salad has not yet reached the table，I ordered a New York steak at 9:20pm and waited an hour. When I came up, the meat surface was dry. If it was new, it took at least 35 minutes! Really can't be expressed in words.",1
"Huge portions, so come hungry. because it is so popular you will have to wait for a bit if you did not make an appointment. can be a little crowded and noisy.",4
For my first time visitng it was Horrible customer service the complimentary bread was Hard as a brick the butter was frozen we didnt have any silverware on the table My table was a mess noone cleaned it. And i never recieved my food after a hour of giving my order. If The customer service is bad Never eat at a place because u never know how ur food will come out ill never ever go to that place again,1
Food was actually good but service took forever!!!,3
"This restaurant chain never disappoints no matter where I have been. Great food, Great service.",5
"Out of all the choices, we chose Cheesecake factory tonight in Vegas, the absolute worse food. We both ordered the philly cheese sandwich, what a joke the bread was awfully hard, and asked for aujus and he was out of it, ended up ordering something different, after waiting so very long 2 eat, we finally got it 2 to go
Never again.",2
Great spot and amazing variety.,5
Phenomenal,5
Everytime we holiday in Vegas first night always dine at the cheesecake factory ceasers been multiple times and never experienced anything apart from great food and service will be there again in June looking forward to it,5
"Great food, Hibachi steak",4
bought 2 slides and they gave us one whole classic cheesecake for free!,5
"Good food, but TOO busy and loud to be comfortable!",2
Very good food.,5
"Great food, cozy ambiance good food and great deserts 😍",5
"Excellent service and the food was hot
and freshly made!!!",5
"I was here the other night with a friend and the waitress was extremely mean for no apparent reason. It seemed as if she got upset because she got our drink order incorrect or because we asked for plastic cutlery. I forgot her name, but she was such a complete sourpuss the manager on duty named Parker stepped in to wait on us. All I remember was her glasses frames were ugly; and her hair was unevenly dyed an ugly red color. I woud never come back to this location again.  I'll be gladly going to the Green Valley or Summerlin location.

The food was overall good besides the b×tch of waitress on duty.",1
I love this chain of restaurants.  Great food.,5
"Just came from there I ordered the grilled salmon, it was very good, we had great service, very busy but never felt like we were forgotten.",5
"eat here multiple times everytime  we are in Vegas, amazing food and great staff",5
Always amazing!,5
Great food!,5
Great food and lovely surprise BD treat with a song!,5
Christmas Day ruined by this lady in the picture very rude to be a cashier or manager she is terrible terrible to be working at customer service in this restaurant!!! Very disappointing,1
Comfort food 10/10,5
Great food and service,5
"I'm not sure what all the rage is about this place.  It's a huge chain - everything is frozen or out of a bag.  High prices for your basic TGIFriday's food, although I guess one portion is enough to feed a family of four.  And the cheesecake?  Well, they warn you in the name, it's from a ""Factory.""  Ugh.",2
"Sweet, sweeter, cheesecake factory. What human can even eat a single piece of cake here?! The sweetness is pretty sweet though.",3
Great food friendly staff,5
The food was really good service brilliant,5
#vegetarianfriendly #datenight #eatoutside #healthy Awesome place for a date or family gathering. They do catering as well. The server was simply amazing and the bartender made the best longisland iced tea. Food came out within 15 minutes which was amazing because i was in a rush for a date with another lady (its cool my wives know) highly recommended!!!,5
Wow I  Never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in my life and got the idea thanks to watching the big Bang theory and my God this was disappointing  My dad and I both tourists by the way got our drinks and bread first and then  For a wait that I could have watched Avengers Infinity War during the time  Our server just disappeared like Doctor Strange and we didn't get our complete food as my dad didn't get his vegetables and the bathroom was also poorly lit not good for a variety of reasons This is probably the longest wait I have ever had while eating out anywhere and anytime I come back here I will dine elsewhere,1
Breakfast here is delicious. Eggs Benedict hit the spot.,5
"Great food, large portions, and reasonable prices. Why eat at the food court at Cesar's when you can get more food, more selection, and pay about the same?",5
Overpriced American food for the meals. The cheesecakes are amazing if they have the one you want in stock. Prices are just too high to justify this chain restaurant.,2
Great food and great great cheesecake,5
"Food was spectacular, the view on the patio is awesome every hour on the hour",5
Enjoyed,5
Avocado eggroll best dish ever!,5
Always a 5 star for a renowned chain. Too many options and off the chain desert.,5
Worst experience ever. Came in on Dec. 25th for lunch. No service after we were seated for 15 minutes so we walked out and will never go back there again!,1
Wonderful service. Awesome menu options,4
Great inviting atmosphere,4
Just like all other states This restaurang delivered amazing food. Service and food was sooo Good. Love the fact that the food taste the same in los angelses i Las vegas.,5
The best food is so good not a chain steak Dania live it go enjoy,5
"The meal I ate was a lot tastier than I expected from a chain restaurant. Definitely cheaper pricing than a lot of the ""unique"" restaurants all around and I was still satisfied with my evening.",5
"During my trip 6 day trip to Vegas I went here three times for dinner.  Excellent food, service and ambiance.",5
Food was super salty. I would have given a lower rating. But when asked how my food was they quickly changed my dish and acknowledged that it was salty,3
Always delicious,5
"Linner= Lunch/Dinner was everything...food +drnks+service= Awesone...12 yrs. Anniversary, 1st time in Vegas.",5
Good food,4
Got a pumpkin cheesecake. Best thing I ever tried!,5
Good place if you are really hungry!,5
My sons' favorite. Huge menu variety of foods for everyone ! And the cheesecake  MUY BUENO!!,5
"service was ok, food was really good. one of my favorite locations of Cheesecake Factory",4
Great service and great food.  Very diverse menu for the venue.,5
"Meu Deus Ainda me lembro desse dia o melhor cheese cake do mundo !!!!! Recomendo demais !!!!
My God I still remember that day : the best cheese cake in world, I really recommend! Any place in world have that !!! I just hope not have heart stroke 😜",5
Service was horrible! Food took for ever to come out. Manager did not compensate anything. Never again at Caesars palace!,1
Well worth a visit. Just love it 😁,4
"Horrible service,  and when we arrived the table next to us was asking to speak to a manager regarding their bad experience.  So we hoped our experience would be better,  but unfortunately it wasn't.  Our waitress never came back after our meal was delivered,  and we had to wave down other waiters to please refill or drinks.....didn't have the best experience there, did not leave a tip, and definitely won't be returning here on our next trip to Vegas.",1
I love everything about this place. The Cheesecake Factory has everything you could ever want from porterhouse to pizza. It's the best!,5
"Surprisingly good and healthy food. The salads are pretty good. And for sure, the Cheesecakes are delicious.",4
Good service delicious food and good price,5
Not impressed!,2
The food was great. Drinks were insanely expensive for the poor quality. Service was good and fast even though it was really busy.,4
BEST  DAMN JOINT ON THE PLANET..!  PERIOD..!,5
Great cheesecake and they had gluten free options!,5
The hot spot...great food love the bread,5
"I ordered fried catfish. It was not seasoned well and mushy.  My potatoes were cold. Thw strawberry margarita tasted like a strawberry slush, there was no noticable alcohol in our drinks. The husband ordered burger and fries. The burger came out and they stated ""we are waiting on your fries"". The fries came out 15 minutes after and this was with constant questions  of ""where are his fries"" and asking for a manager.  While others in the group had complete meals, including their fries. I asked to speak the manager and ""Dave""  came out and offered free chesesecake....we were not happy with the offer while his sandwich got cold waiting for the fries. Side note....we had already waited 1.5 hours for seating. ""Chris"" the waiter was good.  I expected better tasting food, timely presentation of food, and all the food that one person orders to come out together. That is not much to ask from a well known eatery. Not a good experience. I will not go back to this one.",2
Good stuff,4
"We loved absolutely everything about it! I had the ‘dulce de leche cheesecake’ and it was delishhhhh. Even though the restaurant was crowded (we had to wait ca. 30 min) the service was quick! We left very satisfied. The plates are big, as well as the portions! You really should go hungry and with an empty stomach to the cheesecake factory🤗",4
"Huge portions, good service",4
"AMAZING FOOD, great staff and prices were awesome",5
I liked the restaurant but it's pricey,4
It was a wonderful dining experience,4
"""Good service, calm atmosphere, and good food",3
"Great menu options , good service",5
Theres food and cheesecake. Nothing special,2
Great place everyone weve been too love it kids love it banana cream chescake most excellent,5
"It's loud and crowded with long waits to get seated during peak hours, but the food is so worth it.  The menu is diverse and there's always healthy alternatives.

Of course you need to save room for the decadent cheesecakes.",5
Love the Oregon Cheesecake,5
Been here many times. Does not take reservation which is very inconvenient. Foods do not seem fresh to me. Not recommended.,2
Chinese chicken salad is the best. Enough to feed 4 people. Lettuce wraps. Spring rolls.,5
Great Pino at the bar and a late night  spicy chicken eggroll appetizer.  Perfect!,5
"Waiter Bret is a dam liar and thief staff should be retrained. Poor service, bread was cold and hard as a rock food was distasteful. Place should just be shut down.",1
"Horrible service
Extremely slow
Extremely inaccurate
Overall the worst cheesecake factory experience",1
Nice food! Good soize,4
"As always, amazing!",5
"Worst experience ever! The  fatty chick at the entrance, never made eye contact, she lied when said 15 to 20 min and when we asked her about our table, she never apologized to us. We were 5 with two kids, really hungry! Our favorite place in our little town, have kinds people, but in Vegas, was horrible. I know they don't care about it, but was a sadly.",1
"Great Food, I will definitely order this again.",5
"Horrible customer service !waiter  barely came and checked on me ,and when I got my food it was wrong so I told the manager .so when my waiter came back he had an attitude.. he made my Togo box but didn’t but all my food in there on purpose I suppose...should not have tipped him !!!! Then I call the manager and she was like why didn’t I check before I left why would I on food I was already eating!! You put whatever is on my plate in the box how hard is that?!",2
Best Cheese Cake Factory I have ever been to.,5
"We sat out where the two big windows can open. Told our waiter if we can shut it a little since there were a few bees flying in landing on us. He said let me tell my ""manager"". Nothing happened. It had gotten to the point that we started to swat the bees because it was a nuisance. We then had to get up and have some one partially close them.

As far as service. We had a party of 11. Our server kept forgetting what we asked for. We were really patient because we all saw how busy it was and we're not the type to complain etc. We had to ask for a few things more than twice AND our waiter had caught one of our party guest who was walking back to our table to take our dessert to us. I've NEVER seen that before.

The dish my mom had ordered, she said the dish was dry but ate the shrimp. We told our waiter and he said he'll talk to the manager to see if he can take it off our bill. First, let me jist say, WE NEVER told him we didn't want to pay for it. The manager comes up not friendly AT ALL and says ""who had the problem with one of the dishes"". Yes, we all got quiet because how he came at us. We told him our mom didn't like the pasta since it was dry. Then said, that's why you need to tell the waiter earlier so we can get you a new meal, but I cant do anything now since it was eaten, unfortunately I can't take that off the bill okay?, thank you, and he walks away. Again.... never did we say we did NOT WANT TO pay for it.",1
"Food was pretty good but the service took forever and the waiter offered us bread and butter, but never brought it out. We waited forever for our food that seemed to be cooked in a hurry but took forever for us to get.",3
Just stopped in for some takeout and it was good ad it always is. The only thing I don't like about this location is the walk to get to it.,5
One of my favourite places to eat at and visit when I'm in Vegas,5
Good food good service,4
long wait line but the food great,5
"Great place to eat (not only cheesecakes) , the steak was really got, and the staff is very nice :)",5

"Had to ask for forks, the food was good though.",4
"Great food - one of the best mojito
Really tasty veggie burger
1 less star for because waitress was not coming to our table enough.",4
"Don't eat at this location!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

What happend to us tonight was ridiculous! We were waiting one hour and half to be seated and after that we were one hour waiting to get a food. In the end we called manager to talk with him and it turns out that he told us we were waiting only 5 mins.So we  told him that we are unsatisfied and to help us at least with free drink on the house but he couldn't because in his system we were waiting only ""5 mins"", so basiclly he called us liars. Customer service poor. He didn't even say sorry for your waiting or anything. We are locals who will never come back here.

Wooow unacceptable!!!",1
Its cheesecake.......how can you go wrong,5
"Great food and service, as always!",5

"Love cheesecake factory. Great atmosphere, service and food.",5
"It was amazingly delicious, and our waitress was awesome 😀",5
"Food was good, but service less than best. Wrong meal brought out, waited thirty minutes for right meal.",3
The wait to get our food was at least 45 min wait. Then they had my order wrong so I had to wait another 15 mins. I highly dont recommend this place if your hungry and dont have an hour to wait. Plus the wait to be seated was 1/2 hour too.....bad service!,1
One of the greatest restaurants in Vegas. Cheesecake factory is always great.,5
Food was good,4
My favorite place!,5

Can't go wrong here,5
"Went twice - first time we ordered chicken taquitos, their mushroom soup and a bistro shrimp pasta between us. The chicken taquitos had a cruchy, slightly thin outer with deliciously seasoned chicken inside. There was salsa and avocado style sauce on top which gave it an overall lovely kick and great taste. Mushroom soup was good. My partner enjoyed shrimp pasta very much but I personally felt a little less lemon was needed, was still a great dish overall though.

Second time (last Thurs evening) we ordered chicken taquitos, special of the day which was pan seared salmon on a bed of mash with brocolli, mushrooms and a creamy sauce. I had the white choc, caramel and macadamia nut cheesecake and partner had mango lime cheesecake. I asked for tap water, the glass smelt of food as did the water, seems that it hadn't been washed so I had to ask for another. Chicken taquitos outer too thick this time with little salsa, no green sauce and not much crunch. Salmon was nice but most of inside was completely raw. I get a slightly uncooked centre, but this was majority of inside apart from edges. Rest of dish was good. Cheesecake delicious, base tasted like off biscuit so didn't finish. Partner really enjoyed his cheesecake and hoovered it up!

Overall, would go again and recommend to others if experience was like first time we went. Second time was a bit of a let down.",3
Services could be much better,1
"This restaurant ruined my daughters reception dinner! We called ahead and were assured by management they would accommodate the party of 20 on Friday August 7th. Knowing this is a busy place during this time we wanted to be sure there wouldn't be a two hour wait. We get there and of course it was OVER 2 hours late and to make matters THE WORST they wouldn't seat us all together. We had to split the party in 3 different areas. I wasn't able to sit and enjoy dinner with my daughter on one of the biggest days of my life. The icing on the cake? There were 2 empty tables in her section that were never used. When my daughter enquiried to mgt he said the party for those tables never showed. REALLY?! Management ended up comping her ticket,  however I was made to pay for the overpriced food at my table with 5 of her guests, where I sat and cried and couldn't even eat. My heart is still broken that I will never recapture that special time with my only child. I hope corporate notices this review so others in our situation aren't promised something they can't fulfill.",1
Absolutely delicious!!,5
Gluten Free food choices are very good and their Gluten Free Lady Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is fabulous!,5
"Lovely food, aroma, presentation and great atmosphere, it's wonderful eating here, will come again.",5
"Always fantastic! Huge menu, something for everyone and the cheesecakes are fabulous!",5
The best cheesecake in the whole world literally,5
Delicious,5
Yummy good service,5
Always great service and food at this location.,5
"Delicious food, huuuge portions (my family of 6 ordered 4 mains and still ended up bursting), great service, reasonable prices",5
Great food and the cheese cakes are amazing. But the people at the front desk will either mess up your booking or give your table to someone else.,3
What a great atmosphere they have created it's busy so make a reservation and get there early cakes are well worth waiting for the tuxedo cheesecake is so delicious,5
Amazing food. Amazing cheesecake.  Amazing atmosphere.,5
"Wow did the prices go up! $7.00 to add shrimp to a pasta dish is too much, especially when you only get six small pieces.  $12.50 margaritas, it really was $12.50 for a big cup of ice and splash of blood orange. lol.",3
Great place to eat .try the Kahlua Cheesecake at the end,4
Great Food...Long Wait,3
"Friendly staff. 5 minutes wait time. Had Louisiana Chicken Pasta and smores cheesecake, it was delicious!",5
Food was great. But the server was not so good.,3
Okay good fresh food friendly service!!!,5
Tasty,4
It's Cheesecake Factory.,3
"Very disappointing as our fries arrived old and stale, although they did replace with a fresh batch almost immediately so I don't understand why we didn't get given a fresh batch in the first instance.  THEN I received my appetiser of crumbed calamari which was over cooked and tasted burnt.  I was too embarrassed to mention this so endured a very disappointing experience at the Cheesecake Factory Ceasars Palace in Las Vegas.",1
Very good experience,4
Good food and service,5
"Good food ,good views, polite staff.",4
Had my wedding reception of 30 people here and the service was awesome.,5

Like this place wait time can get long beacuse all of the people that go but really good food,4
Great,5
Awesome Food..Awesome Service,4

I work here in the mall and order my lunch to go frequently my order is always ready at the time i request and they are so friendly over there i love my cheescake factory!,5
Amazing experiance start to finish,5
"Went here for valentines day. The service was just ok. It's not fun sitting in the courtyard were all the tourists can watch you eat and look at your food. My wife's food was very bland, and my dish was 10x spicier than it probably should have been. Needless to say we both got sick later that night putting a definite damper on the valentines mood.  I wouldn't go to this one again.",2
Excelent service,5
"Delicious!

It was so good, you must try it your self.",5
"Great food, great service.  Hostess was stressed and didn't greet us for a few minutes, but otherwise an overall positive experience.",4
Love that place.,5
Oh so good cheesecake.,5
"Very friendly stuff, really good different food and drinks",5
We came to Vegas last year visit Cheesecake Factory and had a great experience. This year we came for my birthday we decided to go there for dinner because of the amazing experience we had last time. We order an appetizer shrip summer rolls and for main meal a chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. As the shrip summer rolls came it wasn't what we had expected we ate some and went to eat our main meal which really good. My husband started not to feel well so we left and took a cab to our hotel. He still wasn't feeling good. As we went to bed i woke up at around 1am and had a bad bad stomach feeling i then went and throw up all the summer rolls and layed back in bed and 30 mins later went and throw up again. My husband luckly didn't throw up but all night had a bad stomach. We will never ever be going to cheesecake factory again! And i will be sure to share this with all my friends!,1
The service was less than impressive. Waiter took my plate before I was even finished with my food!,1
Ok,3
Always a great date spot.,5
Delicious shrimp alfredo,5
"So good, same menu as other locations but it's very convenient to Caesars Palace and all of those resterants were overpriced and crowded. This had a table open in 15 min on a Saturday at 7:30pm. Our server was awesome, attentive and personable.",5
One of my favorites. Love it.....,5
"I am changing a previous review that I gave (1 star to 4 stars), the management of the restaurant reached out to me and offered me a gift voucher as a compensation, which is expected.
(The below is an old review)
Poor management! There was a fly in my plate and the manager deducted the price for that meal only instead of deducting the price for 4 meal, I would expect a chain like cheese cake factory to handle these kind of situations in a professional way. I should have went to the newspaper with this and made a scandal out of it.",4
"Avocado egrools and cheesecake were big winners. Service was the big loser.  Dinners: teriyaki chk (burnt), pork chop (dry) were definitely forgetable. We eat here every time we are in Vegas, have for 10+ years.  This year was a major disappointment;  definitely NOT the highlight of this year's dining experiences.",3
"Great food , great service.",5
"This past Fri., July 25th, 2014, hubby & I had our 1st experience to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. We were not disappointed at all!  Considering how busy the Forum Shop area/restaurant was this day, we only had a 15 min wait. We were seated fairly promptly, our waiter came to our table w/in a min or 2.  Ordered our bar drinks, which were the only things that were average, we've both had better.  For appetizer we shared Ahi Tartare, which was delicious, as much as we love avocado, it could have used more tuna.  We both ordered frm the Small Plate menu (mine frm the SkinnyLicious) & enjoyed the food immensely, again not at all disappointed.  Our waiter was even kind enuff to offer to take our pic when he was walking by & noticed that we were trying to take a selfie :D",5
"Excellent food, great dining experience",5
My server (Kandi) was excellent and the food was great!,5

"Went here for lunch.  Had the calamari app and the chicken sandwich for lunch.

Huge place, lots of table seating and tons of bar seating.  This is a SPORTs bar 100%.  So if you're looking to hang out, watch the game or just have a decent meal this is it.

The food was fresh tasting.  Although simple the avocado grilled chicken sandwich was on.  The calamari was cooked perfectly, lightly battered and the dipping sauces went well with it.

Service was 100%.  Smiles, quick and followed up.

Would I go here again?  Yes, cool atmosphere and food.",4
"Very good food! Fast and friendly service.  You might want to call ahead for a table, or you might be waiting 15-30 minutes.  But this is not unusual for an establishment on the strip. Once you get on the waiting list for a table, they will text you when your table is ready. As I stated the food is very good and comes in generous portions. Menu has a good variety to choose from, there is most likely something that will please your pallet. Extensive beer and wine list to choose from also.",4
"Friendly staff, love this place especially great happy hour deals on the strip! The food was really good, burger on point and their chicken tortilla soup was the best I’ve ever had- gotta find that recipe!",5
"Yard house should always receive a 5 star but unfortunately this time I was mix about a 3 or 4 star. Nothing wrong waiting 25 minutes for a seat as we all know this is a very popular place. After we sat down we were handed our Menus. We waited and waited for at least 15 minutes. Until we ask for our Server, I understand mix communication as to who has what table.  No apologies for the wait. We order 2 appetizers first one comes out great timing our Fried Calamari- delicious- Then I get my Entree without the other appetizer or the other plates in my party.  So I decided to share my plate with the others as an appetizer. Couple of minutes later there entree arrived. Then about 2 minutes later the 2 appetizer arrived. I know so I did not get the food as I would have liked. The food here is always exceptional.",4
"Awesome selection of food, beers and unique cocktails. Happy Hour prices keep us coming back for more.",5
The lobster garlic noodles were delicious.  The pizza tasted a little off. Our server was excellent! The wait Tim was an hour on Monday around 8. We waited the hour but never received the text to be seated. There was a glitch or something but they seated us and the ambiance was nice. Definitely would recommend!,4
"The best experience of my trip.  The best genuine service. Johnny our server was the greatest experience for all. Best food, draft beer and dessert. Magnificent",5
Great service great atmosphere  just like the one in Honolulu  that we fell in love with.  Glad to see Las Vegas  kept theirs just like in Hawaii.  Good was so fresh and tasty  as well and don't get me going on their amazing drinks. Their mojito are the bomb so good and tasty as well.  Our waiters   is from Hawaii  and she was a breath of fresh air helpful cheerful  and helped us with great suggestions.  We need more of her in the food service,5
Delicious spot with good food and drinks. Got a little busy when we were there. Very open indoor/outdoor space. Drinks were unique strong and delicious. Was very worth the price. Definitely try the evil jungle princess and the monkey bread.,5
"Spicy Tuna Stack appetizer was amazing, not just visually appealing but also very fresh and yummy. Lobster Garlic Noodles were flavored well however skimpy on the lobster. My husband had the 20oz Bone-in Ribeye which he loved. Will be getting that next time. All in all good food for great prices, especially considering this is downtown Vegas. Waiter was very attentive and made sure our glasses were always full.",4
This place was really nice. The food was great and drinks even better! We got there in time for Happy Hour and it was totally worth the wait!! Go and Enjoy 😉,5
"I liked my meal of salmon and steamed carrots. My daughter ordered a popular noodle dish with seafood and it seemed to be okay, the seafood was good. She also ordered a meat dish which looked tasty but apparently was not that good. The waitress seemed distracted at best.  5 tvs were showing the same thing but not the Olympics which would have been nice/ preferred/ appreciated. I would go there again because the salmon dish was just that good plus I was super hungry and it hit the spot, yum!",3
Very large selection. Jambalaya comes with rice but I selected pasta. Excellent. Spicy but not overwhelming. Very friendly wait staff. Other selections Lobster Pasta and Turkey Club. Appetizer Firecracker Shrimp.,5
"Cynthia, our server, was incredibly friendly and attentive. The vegetarian options were great!",5
You will not be disappointed with the food here. I had the 20oz steak and my wife had the salmon and the food was delicious. The service was great which is hard to find since the pandemic. Lindsey and Adrian was fantastic with the service. I would recommend anyone to go here and eat 5 star.,5
I love checking out Yardhouse in cities that we visit. On this trip they were out of a few beers I wanted to try. Other than that the food was awesome as always. Great place to stop in have a few beers/cocktails and catch up with friends.,4
"Even though this place was not packed we were put on a wait list. I think it was smart on their part. I noticed our one server was dealing with many tables. I think they were taking as many as tables as they could and not inundate staff. Our server was very kind. The picture is firecracker shrimp. Was so good. Got the shrimp tacos, yum.",5
"Joseph was a great server, very nice to my wife and me. Recommended yummy grill cheese with great tomato bisque, everything we ate was great. Great beer, fun location on christmas day. Yard house staff killed it. Thanks",5
The food and customer service was excellent. Wish we visited her earlier in our trip because we definitely would've come back. All food was hot and fresh. Server was friendly and helpful and very attentive. She wanted us to have a positive experience. Wings and spinach artichoke dip were delicious. All the drinks we had were good and we easily able to see multiple tvs to watch football game.,5
Right outside the big Ferris wheel. They got extensive menu. Never seen such an extensive vegetarian menu anywhere else.,5
Got the Everything-Crusted Ahi Sandwich and a New Old Fashioned.  Everything was tasty and service was good.  I would highly recommend the sandwich.,5
"Very cool modern sports bar/restaurant. Food and drinks are great. Service is exceptional. Vampire tacos, bone in ribeye, and the lobster noodles are DELICIOUS.",5
"Foods very good.  Added a House IPA.  Very good, light citrus with bitter follow through.",5
"Burger, sweet potato fries, and tacos were good. Rice not so much. Drinks ok but they didn't have some of the drinks my friend asked for which were on the menu. Overall between group of 6 was this place is ok but nothing to go out of your way for.",4
"My order last night
*Onion Rings
*Fried Calamari
*Korean BBQ Jasmine rice on top green onion and sour cucumber

It was amazing dinner 👍 happy tummy ~",5
"Really good food, nice place. The service was good. Just a really good experience  all the way around. Thanks for feeding  us and 100s others on Christmas day.",5
"Great bar with great service just off the strip.   Food is fantastic and our bartender, Tony, was engaging and attentive!  Try the smoked old fashion!",5
"Had the Blackened shrimp tacos and my daughter had the cheese pizza.  Both very good.  Added a House IPA.  Very good, light citrus with bitter follow through. Nice relaxed atmosphere.  Best deal during happy hour.",5
"Went here to find somewhere to watch the World Series and got a great spot. The staff was quick and attentive without rushing. I was sad to see many of the 100 or so draft choices out, but just shows to their popular. The food was unique and delicious, without spending a ton. They had app and drinks specials too which is hard to find at the good Vegas eateries. Great place",5
Good drinks. Great food.  Try the Korean BBQ beef and the stacked spicy tuna. They also make great margaritas in addition to the selection of draft beers.,4
The food was 5 star a really good place,5
"Amazing place it's located on a promenade of LINQ hotel. Right outside the big ferris wheel.
They got extensive menu. Never seen such an extensive vegetarian menu anywhere else.
They have whole list of Gardin items on their menu.
Try Korean Chicken Wings (vegetarian) and
BBQ Chicken Wings

Must visit for any vegetarian visiting Vegas.",5
First time here and we were not disappointed.  Food was good and even though they are known for their craft beer the drinks were amazing! I had the Whiskey Glazed Salmon with carrots and broccoli and a side of sweet potato fries! Delicious! The salmon melts in your mouth. Will def be back next time!,5
15 minutes wait on a Tuesday night. Huge tables. All American style. The food was great! Service was mediocre. Would highly recommend for visitors. Food came out pretty fast! Prices were pretty reasonable.,4
"The truffle oil parmesan fries are to die for! They were the most delicious appetizer and I would 100% recommend getting them. We also ordered two pizzas which were good. For 3.99, you can add a side to an entree, so I ordered a delicious caesar salad that was actually a great size for the price.",5
Food was delicious. Great staff.,5
Great food and great experience! All the good was good but I highly recommend getting the brookie for dessert. Absolutely divine!!,5
Wednesday Dinner and drinks around 7pm.  I had the Venom street tacos with rice and beans.  They came on a flour tortilla with cheese grilled on the outside.  Carnitas was filling the inside.  I really liked the crispy grilled cheese on the tortilla.  The rice was on the sticky side which was fine by me.  The beans were also really good.,5
we Eat everywhere Brazilian steakhouse Gordon Ramsay's but the Yard House in my opinion was the best the other two restaurant for overpriced and you guys cooked a better steak definitely going back,5
"Never have I ever seen a menu so diverse and reasonably priced. They serve everything from soup to wings to tacos to fried fish to pretzels, and they crush it all. The portions are amazing, the price is great, the service is excellent and the food hit the spot!",5
"Really enjoyed this restaurant! Great atmosphere and the bartenders at the bar were so friendly. The [MAC&CHEESE]2 was awesome, but plate size was huge. My husband really loved the vampire tacos.
Would definitely come back!",5
"Highly recommended and and I can see why.  Lovely atmosphere,  and a great over-all experience. Everything has been delicious so far. I ended up eating here a few times on my Las Vegas trip. Never had a bad bite.",5
"This was my favorite place to eat while in Vegas. My husband and I dined there twice. The first night my husband's steak was not cooked how he asked, but the staff took care of him right away and prepare him another one. The food was delicious and my steak was cooked perfectly. Everyone was so friendly. The second visit we dined on the outside balcony. It was great and we had another great waitress. Thank you Taylor M, Yadira G and the entire team for making our dining experience great!",5
"My brother and I arrived around 930 pm grateful that someplace not fast food was open Christmas night. Our uncle is in the hospital which is why we were in town and needed to have a good meal and some fun on the strip after a long day. Things started out well, but after one round of drinks and an appetizer our bar tender started ignoring us completely, not taking our dinner order or even making eye contact. With no understanding as to why this was happening (we had been polite and were talking between our selves) we had to flag down a different bar tender to cash out and left after waiting an additional 20 minutes with no service. The bar was not very busy and they had three other bar tenders working. Very disappointed, I will likely not return to yardhouse at the Linq anytime in the future.",1
"Food was very good and reasonable on price (for Vegas prices). Large number of excellent draft beers available from local, regional, and nationally recognized craft breweries. Service staff was great and the wait wasn’t that long even during peak hours.",5
"It was nice experience here. Never would have thought to have quinoa which tasted this good! It was a Iittle oily though.The appetizers were also great along with the beer samplers!
We had a nice time here!",4
"Food there was scrumptious!! ( I love to eat) but seriously no complaints. Food was really good. Presentation,  service and atmosphere was excellent.  Btw my first time at a Yard House. I would definitely check out the ones in my area in Orlando. Check out my food photos!!",5
"They have hard seltzer on tap and it was delicious, (I had the dragon fruit). Their Beyond Burger left a lot to be desired though. I have eaten the Beyond Burger at many different restaurants and this was the first time that I did not enjoy it. I honestly could not pin point what it was about this particular burger that I did not like whether it was the way it was prepared or cooked, nut I did not enjoy it. The salad was great, and everyone else in my party enjoyed their food.",4
When their is a wait that means the food is good . The orange chicken is better than Cheesecake factory. The food was cook to order you can tell by how fresh the food was and it came out hot .When I go to Vegas again I will be back .,5
Nice craft beer selection.,4
"👌🏽 we had the spicy jambalaya and the shrimp tempura.

We got the jambalaya based on reviews and TRUST me it did not disappoint. The flavors were great and the noodles were cooked to perfection.

I also got the shrimp tempura appetizer. It was placed on top of a bed of what looked like a fried rice cake... this also wasn't bad either.",5
"Always a great time!  Colby is outstanding!  Sold me on the Lava salt that no one at YH Red Rock knew of.  Absolutely amazing, hope to see him there again next time!",5
The food was super tasty. Good prices. Highly recommended.,5
"excellent food definitely will go back their steak, juicy and delicious, the tacos absolutely delicious their drinks perfect",5
They had a large beer menu including a separate local beer menu and some special house varieties. They also offer four sizes of beers so you can try several. The food was amazing too. Everything was well prepared and tasty. I will be coming back!,5
"Not busy 10:30pm, took forever to receive drinks, food not hot/warm.",2
"My husband enjoyed his jambalaya, I had the beyond burger and didn't really care for it. I did enjoy my gardein wings in sweet chili sauce. Service was good.",3
"I went with a friend. This is my second visit to this location. The portions are great! We split two appetizers and were comfortably full, not to mention that the food was delicious! The bartender made us alcohol-free smoked bloody Mary's. They were quite tasty! We will definitely visit again!",5
Their food is better than you could ever imagine.,5
We showed up late at night.  I asked if they were still serving food.  They said yes. We were probably the only sober patrons.  I ordered a beer and a pretzel with beer cheese and honey mustard.  The texture of the beer cheese was that of gritty curdling that happens when a cheese sauce is old/overcooked. The beer cheese also lacked flavor. This dish is normally also served with horseradish mustard.  We opted for honey mustard.  That didn't happen.  We got the horseradish.  Our server was pleasant.  No complaints on her.  What do you expect near last call?,3
"Bone-in Ribeye!!!  You won’t believe how great this steak is here. 3 of the 4 us had it last night and we all raving about how good it was. Better than Del Frisco’s at less than half the price. And in a fun, friendly, relaxed atmosphere as well.  The staff was great!!",5
"5/5 Greg was the best, tuna sandwich was good and the small mac'n cheese was plenty of food for two!",5
This was our first time dining here and I must say it was amazing. We started with the firecracker shrimp and let me just say the rice cake underneath sent my tastebuds on a ride to heaven. The sweet and crunchiness tied in so perfectly with the spiciness of the shrimp. We also had the fried calamari that was pure perfection. For dinner I had the bone-in ribery with broccoli and parmesan mashed potatoes. It was splendid! My husband had the whiskey glazed salmon and well all I can say is his plate was empty before I could get a picture. The prices were reasonable. Very nice atmosphere with great service. Definitely coming back our next visit.,4
Happy hour offered delicious appetizers and cocktails to choose from at a discounted price and service was wonderful as always!!,5
"Excellent food, excellent service and prices well.",4
"The poke nachos here is what keeps me and my friends coming back!!.

Everything in the menu is delicious and full of flavor. Everything from the appetizers to the main courses, the sandwiches and burgers.

When it comes to beer they have something for everyone, from light lagers to double and triple IPA and my favorite stouts and porters.",5
"Love the Yard House! With an insane amount of taps, there's literally something for EVERYONE  Grab some Haystack Enchiladas while you're there & you've found perfection 😆",4
"Great food, I recommend this place for a relaxed environment while eating. Whiskey Salmon, Steak Street Tacos, and Fillet Mingon!!",5
My fav restaurant in town!,5
"Our server was not only friendly, but so accommodating to our requests!  We ordered a bunch of appetizers since it was Hsppy Hour a d they were 1/2 price!  Everything was delicious!  Nice pleasant atmosphere and location!",5
This was my first time here and I was not disappointed. The spicy tuna sushi was amazing!! The tacos were out of this world! Bon Appetit!!,5
Food was excellent.   Half hour wait at 8pm  now bad.  Just rude when wanted to get drink at bar while we wait. Forced to wait outside.,4
Great restaurant. Cool bar. Very good bourbon selection,5
"It was the wings for me!!! Omg, the best, crispiest, meatiest wings! Delicious! I have to come back. We had such a great time, I forgot all about my free appetizer! The original margarita was perfect. Everything about our dinner was fantastic from walking in to leaving.",5
"I spent a week in Las Vegas earlier this year. I went to Yard House literally every single day of my trip just so I could get their delicious shiitake garlic noodles. When I say I dream about these noodles, I mean it. Not a day goes by that they don't cross my mind. I tried recreating them to the best of my ability, but it simply was not the same. Do yourself a favor and head to Yard House for a delicious, life-changing bowl of shiitake garlic noodles. The soft pasta is balanced out by the textured mushrooms, the saltiness of the cheese and garlic complimented by sweet honey sauce. It's a spiritual experience. 5/5.",5
A slight hike to get to but does have a good beer selection by Vegas Strip standards.,5
"Very good food, big portions, this was split between two and still leftovers. Great prices for the strip. Have to get the vampire taco added to your order!",5
"During our recent trip to Las Vegas, my family and I stumbled upon this place after wandering around the Strip all morning, so you can visualize a group of hot, tired, hungry, and thirsty people looking for a place to refuel our bodies. Happy Hour there is 3pm-6pm, so we stepped inside to check it out. The wait time for the six of us was very short, maybe 10 minutes, then we were seated at a very nice table where the atmosphere immediately made us feel good about choosing this place. We were immediately greeted by our waitress, Kales, who I just can’t say enough good things about, and she proceeded to make our rambunctious crew feel right at home. She brought us ice water while we reviewed the menu, then took our drink orders and explained the Happy Hour menu and answered all of our questions with skill and precision. The prices were extraordinarily reasonable for anything on the menu, but the appetizers and some other selections were half-priced for Happy Hour, so we were skeptical of the quantity of the food we would receive; however, Kales reassured us that the portions were the same no matter what time of day or night you ordered. So we ordered the Chicken Nachos, Four Cheese Spinach Dip, Chicken Tenders, Fried Calamari, and various other selections, some beers for the guys and mixed drinks for the gals. The food and drinks arrived promptly, and EVERYTHING exceeded our expectations. The food was excellent, the half-yard beers were ice cold, and we took home boxes of leftovers. Kales definitely gets the gold medal for her service, and the Yard House has become our go-to refueling stop whenever we are on the Strip!!!",5
We were amazed at the amount of food that came out.  Especially since it was half off for happy hour.,5
Fantastic service! Food was great and very accommodating with my dietary restrictions.  Their house beers leave alot to be desired. Best Sangria on the strip!,4
"Food is always consistent, and location is always clean. Staff is friendly, helpful and attentive. Always a taste of home when visiting Vegas. Got a table in 15mins on a kinda busy night. Would always go back when I'm in town.",5
"Met with family from out of town, decided we'd stop here because of the rooftop experience. The drinks were great, the service was great and my brother and I were dancing and singing along to the music. I'll definitely be back!",5
"Good food. Prompt, friendly service. Second visit, and we'll be back.",4
Went there while in Las Vegas. They had a happy hour special and ordered one of their pizza. The pizza was great and they offered a large variety of beers,4
I went there three times on this trip and had great service every time. I consider myself a nachos coinosseur and they have the hands down best Nachos. Beer selection is both very large as well as some of the best prices for draft on the strip.,5
"Huge selection of beers with some tasty food choices
Editing to add that this place is an incredibly good value for the Times Square area. $10 for a nice 23oz IPA is a good value anywhere in NYC. And not only is the food well priced it is much better than I expected.",5
The wings were so delicious!!!  I tried the steak bowl and it was also delicious.  Our server was excellent.  Definitely worth a visit.,5
"My friends and I stopped at Yard House for dinner and we had such a great time. Our Server Michael E was super attentive and kind! We had an assortment of entrees and appetizers including: Onion Ring Tower, Calamari, Chicken Wings (split into 2 flavors!), Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich, Lobster Garlic Noodles and soo many other delicious foods as well!",5
Great food and drinks. All the food we ordered was delicious and came out quick. We ordered 2 steak 1 well done and the other medium well done also a BBQ pizza and a sausage jambalaya,5
"Excellent food and experience. Awesome staff. Best part is happy hour. Half price apps & pizzas. I had cheese curds, a pizza, and a coke for $18. Cannot beat that. Best cheese curds I've had in Vegas.",5
"We had such a great time here! Thanks to our server Greg who was knowledgeable of the drinks and even offered a pineapple mint one that we would love to come back and try next time! The food came out in a timely manner and Greg was on it with refills and checked on us often. We would def return, the food was great and so was our server!",5
Service was good and the food we ordered was good. Just didn't care much for the things they had on the menu.,3
"Loved loved loved the service, great customer service!  And the food really good! normally I get disappointed about plates sizes... but everything was great size and delicious !! can't wait to go back ! 😍👏",5
"Server was awesome ,kind and friendly.  Hostess not so and meal not as expected.  Big no for me when shrimp not deceived.  Atmosphere was pleasant.",3
"I really enjoyed this Yard House location. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable. I had a great time with friends. The food was great and the waitress with red hair color I had on the first visit was cute and introduced me to possibly my new favorite beer. The waiter on the second visit informed me of some great other beers to keep an eye out for and was great to talk with.

Strongly Recommend this location and I will be back in the future.",5
"Our server Brittany was f&$king awesome. If you come to eat, ask for Brittany. Food was awesome, poke nachos, sweet potato fries, burgers and salmon were killer!! If you are on the strip hit up Yard House you will not be disappointed at all.",5
The four of us all enjoyed our lunch choices. Everything was so fresh and delicious! The wait staff was excellent. We will return the next time we come to Las Vegas.🤗,5
"Great experience, our waitress was great, attentive and very pleasant. Great selection of beers, my wife ordered the pasta dish which was a bit too salty. Wings were juicy and tasty. Will definitely comeback.",4
"Must check out yardhouse if you're on the promenade.  Best choice of beers, screens everywhere, great food and best service.  Get the wings well done with some truffle fries!",5
"Very good customer service,  vegan options were available and decently priced.  My partner enjoyed his meal and drinks as well.",5
Impeccable Tastes as usual of Yard House. Staff was polite and fast. Well maintained covid-19 precautions. Had a very good time.,5
"Fantastic sports bar with an unreal selection of beers and an incredible happy hour. The staff are fantastic and a true credit to the establishment. I was so impressed with the first visit I went right back the next day, and between Corby and Hayley I couldn't have asked for better servers. Any time I'm back I will be 100% sure to visit",5
"Was a pretty good experience. The food was good. The waiter was good. The drinks were good. All in all, good time.",5
Delicious food and great service,5
"Great place, great food and great drinks. Their half price apps during the happy hour are unbeatable.
One of my favorite places in Vegas.",5
Yummy vegan options: Guac 🥑 & Impossible burger 🍔!!!  + Watermelon Salt Margarita and  Tea,5
"Great selection of beer, even though the one I wanted was out... the tacos I had were blah. The service was slow and we had multiple servers come to our table with other people's orders. I would not recommend this place.",2
Great honest staff.. Jose was an awesome server and was spot on with what was what.,4
"It was my first meal in Las Vegas and I gotta say. This place set the beer in food and of course the beer selection, so much to choose from!",5
Food is great. Drinks are good. Nice place to grab a bite to eat and drink if you're killing time!,4
"A little longer wait than I expected, but forgot about it being happy hour! Great food, excellent service by our waitress.",5
"My wife and I were overwhelmed by the exceptional quality of the food. Flavorful and fresh. I enjoyed the Loco Moco and she loved the Avocado Toast. The service was as good as the food; perhaps even better. The restaurant was the cleanest we have seen in Vegas. The music was great. Lastly, you can use Apple Pay to pay at the mini kiosk on your table. Can't wait to come back a second time.",5
"Visited 11.21.20

Food was good, drinks were good and waitress was attentive and effective.",5
"Its the best! I've also been to Yard House, several times in Texas. Must try Beyond Burger.",5
"OMG! The BEST Bbq bacon cheese burger ever! And if you go in the evening, ask for  Veronica. She is by far the best waitress we have ever had, and I ain't young.  We come to Vegas almost every year and we will return to Yard House EVERY year!",5
Good meal. Good service. Reasonably priced for this area of the Vegas strip. Pretzel was best we have had so far in the local Vegas Strip area.,5
Always love Yard House. Even though some appetizers were only ok. Beer selection makes up for it.,5
"During a time of covid and social distancing, this place absolutely kills it in Vegas.  I was with a bunch of buddies and we wanted to get drinks, eat some apps, have dinner, drink more drinks and watch sports.  It seemed like every single place in the area had a wait time to get seated so we tried our luck at yard house and got seated immediately.  Not only in very spacious comfortable booths, but also near 6 different TVs.

They took our drink and app orders right away which was very appreciated.  My buddies and I spent 2 hours there having a blast and eating fantastic food.  The portion sizes were gigantic.  We ordered the nachos and onion rings to start and we were amazed by how much they brought over.  For our entrees we got some chicken sandwiches and a few of us got sliders.  Chicken sandwiches were juicy and flavorful and the sliders were way bigger than anticipated, but still they upheld juicy tender beef quality.

Wait staff was friendly and checked on us frequently.  Will definitely come back when I’m in Vegas again",5
"This was one of the best restaurant / local sports bar in this cute shopping complex. The ambience was nice, without being too overbearing or too loud. I ordered the lobster bisque agnolotti and it was AMAZING. Their portion sizes are A1, and the taste was impeccable. The ravioli were stuffed and the sauce was nice! I left full, couldn’t even finish it before my flight. It was also Wednesday night so we were able to catch the wine special; they had whole bottles discounted to $16. I’ll definitely be back 😊😊😊😊.",5
"We had a great experience at this Yard House. We were able to get an outdoor seat on the upstairs deck. I had the orange chicken which was really good. Justine, our waitress, was amazing!",5
Love this place...definitely becomes so busy that they run out of many of their popular spirits.,4
"The best experience in Las Vegas, Johnny was the greatest experience and the best server.
The food and prices are great.
Recommended for everyone.",5
"Amazing staff and excellent service! One of the best places to try their wings.. Also, very good prices and excellet quality of food.",5
"What can I say? Great food, awesome and attentive, customer service. Fair prices and i left happy even though i missed happy hour. Good times.",4
Food was good but they only had one game on.  We hoped to watch something else.,4
Great place to go for food and drinks.,5
Yard House is my go to for a wonderful meal with great service and drinks. It’s comfortable and great for business travelers who may not be into the loud/late/over the top Vegas experience. The happy hour is spectacular and I look forward to my visits so I can get the ahi sashimi appetizer and some of the house collaboration beers. The staff is so friendly and welcoming.,5
Brandon was a great server! Happy hour is wonderful. Half of appetizers and pizza's.  2 dollars off really good beer.,5
Great experience & Thomas was the best host,5
"This was an amazing restaurant that we went to when stayed at the LINQ Promenade. We went here twice for some brunch and both times were a great experience. The first time I had a classic breakfast and the second time I came I had their Nashville Chicken Sandwich, which was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The sandwich was so good that my girlfriend and other friend ordered it both times that we went. The service was amazing as well. Very happy that we went here and would very much recommend in the area to try.",5
The double crunch wings are really good. Our server was friendly and really helpful in regards to our gluten free allergy. The only reason this is not a 5 is because the ribeye steak was just okay. It was prepared properly but just lacked any flavor.,4
"Food better than expected,  awesome service",5
"Service was great and the food was pretty good.  My deal was there was an almost 30 minute wait, got in there and it was probably at 25% capacity.  So there is a lot of trouble getting wait staff.  i get that, but i would have much rather sat inside than standing around in 100+ degree heat for the table.

also in my salad there was a huge wooden toothpick buried inside the salad.  I was told it was when there was a substitute it lets the servers know something was changed.  i get that, but that was hidden in my salad.  Salad was good, and my wife had the sliders.  Service was prompt and attentive.

My table was grossly sticky.  Very sticky.  hence the 4 stars.",4
"Love the brews, love the food, the service is excellent. The prices are fine. A go to spot for me.",5
"I had the spicy jambalaya! Very very delicious, fresh and was served quickly. Thank you",5
"Pepper Jack Burger was Delicious! 😋 substitute Fries for Mac & Cheese and it was Out of this World. Best Mac & Cheese I've Ever had. Great Experience, Thank You♡",5
"December 2021:
Ordered the kale salad with chicken. Was very tasty. Don't know why I always eat salads here but so far, I like their salads! 😋

December 2018:
Tried the ahi tuna salad. Was very good and I would order this again.

Menu is quite extensive. Lots of options.

🍺 selection is very good.  I wish there were more rotating craft options.",5
Julien gave us great service. Food was amazing. Very casual atmosphere with tons of beer choices. Great people watching spot.,5
Outstanding and delicious! And I dare you to try Dragons milk!,5
Stopped in for a quick meal. Had the bbq bacon cheddar burger and the wife had the salmon. We were both very pleased with our meals and drinks.,5
The happy hour deals are the best! The food and service are always great here.,5
Food was good and even though they are known for their craft beer the drinks were amazing!,5
"Staying on the strip and slept in till pass 11:30pm at night, Yard House was the only place open this late.  We were able to get a seat in 20 minutes for a party of 4.

I didn't realize that they had a 2nd floor.  We dined upstairs / open air roof top and it was a beautiful night.  We sat close to the edge where you could people watch.

Service was good.  She checked up on us quite often.

Food:
Fried Cheese Curds
Chicken Lettuce Wraps
Chicken Sandwich

The cheese curds were delicious.  I've never had it from any of the other locations.  The lettuce wraps are okay.

Definitely a late night spot to hangout at.",4
Everything was great will eat their again,4
"A very nice place to be, friendly staff and good beer and food.
We had a meeting there including 4 per in wheelchairs and the table was perfect, everything else’s was handicap accessible too.",5
When in for the happy hour apps. This is a must on your Vegas visit. Yummy food and great prices.,5
"The calamari was trash, cooked to long. The Cobb salad was on point though. My grandson got pizza,he enjoyed it. My son got the hot chicken dinner, he enjoyed his food as well.",4
Ribeye was perfectly medium rare. Over 100 beers on tap. Servers were quick to reconcile any miscommunication during drink/food ordering.,5
"Yard house is a great place to eat by yourself or with a Group because food is very good, prices are reasonable and they have different options to choose from. My favorite food there is called 'poke nachos', of you like tuna fish you need to try them.",5
"Great food and service for a reasonable price, definitely worth the trip.",5
Although the wait was long when we were seated we had excellent service by Kymball. Definitely recommend Yard House. If you get Kymball he'll take care of you.,4
"This restaurant is quite overrated. Prices are more expensive than the popular choice, Cheesecake Factory, while the food is worse. The wings and Brookie were decent, but nothing special. The pizza was worse than what you would find at a national pizza chain, such as Domino's. They claimed to give free parking, but charged $12 for parking in the LINQ parking garage.",2
"We've eaten at this location twice now. Overall, the staff is friendly, food is good, great happy hour deals.
I LOVE the Moo Shu Egg Rolls. I would return just for these! They have tons of flavor and the dipping sauce is awesome. The fried Mac & cheese is decent, not the best I've had, but not the worst. They came out extremely hot and fresh. I wish we would have skipped the margarita pizza. It was relatively cold and had very little flavor - not worth the price. I would definitely return to try some other appetizers and entrees!",4
Always great food and service. Had the chicken nachos and tortilla soup along with wine and beer. Very yummy,5
Loved my experience here.  Our waiter Willie was awesome - best service of our entire trip.  He provided fantastic suggestions of beers to try. Food was delicious and the beer was even better.  We had a lot of fun.  We will come again next time.,5
Very disappointing.  15 mins with bartender walking past before beer order.  Can’t change games on tv.  All on one game. Left and went to a great place!,1
Food was amazing. Avocado was fresh and tasty. Servers were really nice. Was the only restaurant in the area with a wait.,5
"The atmosphere was fancier than the food, but the food was still good. Definitely try to queso. Our server, Tatum, was awesome, knowledgeable and did great at accommodating a birthday. Prices were reasonable and our party of 7 didn't have to wait too long to get a table.",4
"THEY DONT TAKE RESERVATIONS. THEY TOLD US 15 MINUTES TO BE SEATED, WE WERE SEATED AN HOUR LATER. OUR PARTY OF THREE ALL ORDERED THE 20 oz STEAK BONE IN STEAK WITH VEGGIES. I ALSO ORDERED A CARROT CAKE TO GO AND THE CAKE CAME FIRST. OH EMM GEE ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. THE CARROT CAKE WAS RUNNY. IT WAS GOOEY. I SENT IT BACK. THEN OUR FOOD CAME “UGH”. MY STEAK WAS GROSS, MY MOTHERS STEAK WAA GROSS (my mother actually threw up at the table into her plate!!!) AND OUR LOVED ONE WHO HAD FLEW INTO TOWN THAT WE WERE HOSTING HIS STEAK WAS GROSS TOO. WE COMPLAINED, WE REFUSED TO PAY, WE SENT ALL OF OUR FOOD BACK. THE MANAGER CLEARED OUR BILL AND WE LEFT STILL HUNGRY EMBARRASSED AND SUPER DISAPPOINTED",1
"The batter fish & chips I ordered had a nice flavor, was nearly 2 inches thick, & came with freshly made tartar sauce that was delicious.   It was served hot, to the point that it was still warm by the time I returned to my room at Caesar Palace.   On a busy night my order was ready in 15 minutes or less.  My experience would have been made better if the system staff used to input orders didn’t take so long.   I also would like to have been asked whether I wanted lemon with my fish, in which case I would have said, ‘no’.  I like my fish crispy and when lemon is placed  in the container it makes the fish soggy.  I was able to avoid this mishap since the hostess showed me my food order prior to leaving and I was able to remove the lemon before the juice was absorbed into the fish.   Lastly, I was impressed when I received a timely call to inform me that my food was ready.  Many places drop the ball at this point and allow people’s food to grow cold but not here.   I hope they keep up the good work.",4
"Put name in for a table at 5 on a Thursday and was told about a half an hour wait.  Was curious why the wait was so long here and no wait everywhere else.  Decided to go with it and walk around a bit. Wait ended up being very short and you can monitor your spot on the phone.  I really liked that. Got seated to find that it was happy hour from 4-6 and that they had some killer deals on drafts and appetizers. Ordered some boneless wings for my kids which they loved.  All enjoyed their kids meals as well. House beers were solid and inexpensive comparatively. Major fudge was that staff forgot my meal when they brought out everyone else’s. I brought it to the waitresses attention and needless to say they forgot again causing me to wait about twenty minutes while my family ate. Usually in my book this would be reason enough for a bad review but the manager immediately came out to my table upon learning of the errors, comped my meal and also offered to give everyone at the table free desserts. We didn’t do the desserts as we were full since the food was excellent.  Mistakes happen at all places but what separates the good from the bad is how they handle it. This place was top notch and I would totally visit again when in town.",5
Near the Linq hotel. Very good! Thanks Justin!,5
This was soooo good I forgot the name of the drink! VEGAS Baby! Near the Linq,5
"We had a very good meal here, the pizza we ordered and sandwich was very good. The service was a little slow during the day but it was still a pleasant experience. I found it to be in a perfect location when staying at the Flamingo and is great for a quick bite.",4
"The three times we dined there were excellent. All of the staff were pleasant and on top of everything. The vegetarian/vegan selection was surprisingly comprehensive, the only caveat beging anything fried shared a fryer with  non-vegetarian items. Of all the cocktails we had during our stay these were the best, and the rest of my party thoroughly enjoyed the beer selection.",5
Went for appetizers and drinks.  The poke nachos and drinks were awesome.  Great service too.,5
"The ahi tuna nachos were unbelievable! Great location, bathrooms were really nice.",5
I went there alone and they treated me the same as if i was there with a party of 4. Ive never had a bad experience there and thats why i keep coming back,5
"The food is very good. It had not occurred to us to eat here as we tend to frequent during happy hour. From now on this is in my top 3 go-to for a great meal. I would not say it is a good date place as the dining room was busy and people frequently stopping by our table.

The two dishes pictures here are Nashville Chicken and Short Rib Ravioli. The chicken has a secret hot kick in the throat several moments after consumption. They should warn people of this. I love it, but my companion does not do well with spicy and would not have enjoyed it. The second dish of ravioli was a surprise with the short ribs inside the pouch. I’ve only seen it on top in other places. Both were delicious and worthy of a second visit to verify.

Put Yard House on your short list because the food, parking and atmosphere are easy and worth it.",5
"Great atmosphere, friendly staff. Had a great time. Good food and mixed drinks.",5
Super service and food was delicious.,5
"Enjoyed our meal - it was not at all busy and our meal was very good. Was normal Las Vegas prices as expected. Playing was very nice and food was tasty!

Nonetheless, will ikely look around for other places.",4
It was amazing with great service with taste,5
"Great food, great staff, great beer, great environment. Overall this place it great. Ordered a steak and potato’s with a artichoke appetizer. The lobster artichoke appetizer was a bit fishy for me (I love fish.) steak was cooked perfect and potato’s were great. I’d also recommend the fried macaroni. They also have a nice beer selection and great deals on tuesdays.",5
Great beer selection and convenient online check-in options. Sign-up for their mailing list for a free appetizer.,5
"Sat at the bar, took longer than expected to be greeted.
Margherita pizza was alright but Fist full of mango cider was good.",4
"Always enjoy the food and beer selection is pretty decent. I still give them 5 stars because while way too many of the 100+ some taps are filled with everyday beer, they do still have a nice selection of local brews",5
Great appetizers. Good food - we all had steaks and they were cooked properly to our specifications. Service was a tad slow and there was a wait to get in but we could tell they were understaffed so it was understandable.,4
"I really wish I could give this more stars. We chose this place because they had gluten free options for my daughter. The gluten free burger bun was rather old and was basically falling apart. Crumbling to pieces. Nothing special burger wise. Not much taste. I can’t remember what I was going to order originally but whatever it was they were out of for that night so I ended up with the spicy chicken sandwich with coleslaw on it. That was ok. Lacked sauce and if the coleslaw wasn’t on it- it would be bone dry. I didn’t eat the fries, they needed to be cooked longer. My husband had fish and chips and said it was mediocre but definitely not the worst he’s had. My son had the grilled chicken avocado sandwich and it was ok but he wouldn’t order it again. We left spending $98 and wasn’t happy with our choice of eating  there. I would come here again if this was where someone else picked but I don’t think I’ll ever choose this place again. The service was great and the wait time wasn’t long at all. It’s in a good location with lots to do around it so it wasn’t horrible just not worth the money.",3
"The nachos were kinda trash, they had some like spaghetti sauce on it and it had beans too, but wasnt really a bad experience but not a great one either. Kinda normal spot to go to imo",3
Basically had any brew you'd wanna sample or drink and the food was good! The bar staff was super friendly considering what they have to deal with daily.,4
"The waiter was great, the food not so much. We just got appetizers. The onion rings were soggy from being so greasy (not fried long enough or drained properly.  The guacamole had no seasoning in it, so it was very bland tasting.",3
"Food was just the way we liked it, staff nice and service fast.  The plates could be better washed... Overall we had great time and woyld come again.",4
The food was absolutely delicious! We were seated right away the waitress by the way her name is Stephanie was very attentive always checking to make sure we were good. Workers were all nice greeting as you walked in and as you left will definitely go again.,5
"I came here with my uncle and my brother for dinner. I had the clam chowder to start, which was excellent. I also had a chicken sandwich which was fine. My brother ordered some tacos and rice. He said it was a bit too spicy. Both the rice and the tacos were spicy. My uncle had a Cobb salad which he liked. There is a good selection of beers here and we all enjoyed our choices. Not an inexpensive meal overall but a good one. Service was very good.",4
Amazing beer selection on tap. Only problem is they run out of a lot of them and you wouldn't know upfront what is available.,4
"Loved it, Food was Great!!",5
Took a while to get seated (even though there were a lot of empty tables). Food was good. Family loved it.,5
Great food and service. Fun casual atmosphere,5
Went to Yard Hoise last night as Pre-Birthday celebration for my bestie. The bartenders were super sweet and the food was absolutely delicious. The bartender gave my bestie a chocolate cake desert for her birthday. Thank for providing us with great service. This was a great birthday start off.,5
"The staff never came acknowledged me at my table after I was sat. I ended up leaving the resturant without eating. There was no ""I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A SECOND"" ""WHAT CAN I BRING YOU TO DRINK?"" just say something to let me know THAT YOU KNOW I AM SITTING HERE.",1
"Love this place! The food is generous and so tasty, I love the street tacos! The atmosphere is nice and a huge beer menu! Always a good time",5
Refreshingly reasonably priced and great food in Vegas. Amazing staff too,5
"Yard House  is great place to eat. Excellent  prepared food ,very tasty ,fresh.
Onion rings tower my favorite .
Wide selection of draft beer, nice sample.
I love Yard's Happy hour .",5
"Chain Restaurant, One of our favorites. Always good quality food, reasonably priced. Happy hour offerings extensive. Large menu, something for everyone. Tremendous selection of Beer. Only comment, the restroom was extremely filthy, hasn't been cleaned in quite some time.",5
"Great food, some of the best that I've had on the strip. Enormous selection of beers and cocktails.",5
Best place In every city I have been in.,5
"What an amazing place! I’ve visited 3 times in 4 days. Most fantastic service I’ve ever had. The friendly staff has amazing knowledge about beers and try do out do each other. If you like a certain beer they will give you suggestions and samples to try before you decide on your beer of choice. Great variety of beers and food is delicious too. Showing sports events and music videos too for sports lovers.
Can not fault anything. Must visit for any beer lover!! More than 100 beers on tap...",5
Wings and bread pudding were delicious! Staff provided great customer service!,5
The food is always great there no matter what we get. The filet mignon is awesome!,5
"Christine our server was awesome.
We will be coming here more. Food 👍",5
"I enjoyed the food. The service was excellent, and the wait time was not that long. I strongly suggest trying this place out if you haven't already.",5
"Food was really good! no complaints there, but our waiter took our order and went to the next table and talked to them for literally 15 minutes before putting in the order to the cooks. Nothing wrong with chatting, but for 15 whole minutes? unprofessional",4
"One of the best places to sit back and socialize with great food and refreshing brews.  The prices are reasonable, not inflated pricing just because they arr in Vegas like other franchises do (Starbucks for example).

If you are in a hurry for a quick lunch between your daily shows, this is the place.  I can sit at the bar, order, drink, eat, drink some more and pay in just 30 minutes.

Excellent customer service.  The bar and restrooms are always clean. This Yard House is always ready for me.",5
"Great food, large portions, and friendly staff. Reasonably priced (rare in vegas). Visited 2 times on this trip.",5
Great service and food.  Happy hour has great prices on food! Nachos were the best!,5
This Yard house is in a perfect Vegas spot on the Strip. Lots of people watching and things to do before you get your table. On a Saturday night our wait was 40 minutes  and was told an hour. Plenty of stuff to do while we waited.  Because of Covid there was a shortage of staff and the place was 1/2 it's normal crowd. The food was good and drinks were a little pricey. So many beers to choose from.  Over we enjoyed our time at this Yard House.,5
Great food!! All the beer you could imagine on tap!!,5
Great Selection of food. The menu is big... Large Selection of Liquor..,4
"Rock and roll. Lots of beer to choose from. Great wait staff. Not to busy, even on a weekend. Lots of reasons to stop in for a beer or food.",5
"The Las Vegas location in the Promenade was ok. My second time there and this time was a little disappointed that the waitress was too busy chatting with the table behind us for 15 minutes. It's good to interact with your customers but not when you're supposed to refresh our drink and get our food order.  She was a very nice young lady but be a little more attentive to all of your customers. Food was good, atmosphere was good as well.",3
"Best place to eat on the strip! Amazing food, at a reasonable price. Very hard to find in Vegas! This place is top notch!",5
Decent food. Decent drink. Decent price. Let's face it. It's a chain.,4
"Their friend chicken sandwich is insanely good! 🤤🤤🤤 I also liked their vampire tacos, great stoner food! 🌮🌮🌮",5
Great Vegan options and so delicious! Multiple beers on tap!,5
"Very much enjoyed the half yard glasses, the seared Ahi was quite good as well.",4
"Let me start by saying that I’m a huge yard house fan, I’m a regular customer at the one by my house. Unfortunately my experience at this yard house is completely different.
Sunday: I order Weihenstephaner Beer, they are out of it, no big deal, it happens so I order Baptist wit, they are out, so I decide to play it safe and order something domestic, mic ultra and you guessed it, they are out of that as well. I feel that if a wide selection of beer is your thing and you don’t have 3 out of 3 then something is wrong…
I finally ask them to give me any beer they have and a small ahi crunchy salad, I was charged for the large one.
Tuesday: they are having technical issues, no beer at all, no big deal right, we all have tech issues sometimes, I order wings and 27 min later no wings so I just got up and left. If you like the yard house experience avoid that one.",1
"They have a good food menu and a great drink menu but unfortunately the food often sounds better than what is served, as was the case during my most recent visit. Nothing was bad but rather individual things are often over or under cooked in my experiences and the menu is overpriced by quite a lot. This visit had us waiting about 45 minutes for our food which was not appreciated. I will continue to go back but only when there isn't a good alternative nearby and 4 stars is being generous based on this experience.",4
"Located in Las Vegas, we found this Yard House location somewhat late at night while looking for a decent place to grab a bite that wasn't over the top expensive.  The Yard House was open and it didn't disappoint.  The late menu was enough to satisfy a large appetite and the staff was friendly.   They had a large selection of drinks.  I would visit again.",4
We had a party of 18 and the staff was fantastic at seating us and the service was amazing..,5
Everything was good. This is a definite stop when visiting Vegas!!,5
"The beer selection is excellent, and some of the food is very good. The service varies from mediocre to pretty good. Their practice of making everyone wait for a table or seat at the bar, even when the place is almost empty, is absurd though. I had a new entree-porcini crusted halibut, which was excellent, except that the bowl wasn’t heated enough, making the sauce cold. They also served pepper in packets, which is pretty tacky for a $30 dish.",3
"Do you have a dairy and egg free wife? Yep!

More than 2 kids? Yep!

Want to be near the strip? Yep!

This chain under the High Roller hit all the right notes for us when we visited. The wait staff was friendly and accommodating. The beer list was fantastic. Food was high quality and priced well. We'd come back here",5
Best draft selection ever. Food was great too.,5
"This place was decent, first visit. I ordered pizza, everyone with me ordered their own thing. All were satisfied except one, her coconut shrimp was burnt. The teas we're not as tasty as we were use to. Overall, I'd go back and give it a second shot.",3
"OMG! I was in Vegas for 4 days and for some reason yard house was the only place with good food. I ate there for 3 out of the 4 days. There clam soup is delish, also!!!",5
"I was so excited to try the food here because I was really craving Nashville hot chicken. What I got was a small piece of fried chicken which wasn't spicy whatsoever,  was a complete RIP off for $18 - to be advertised as a house special is a joke. Similarly we got a meat's pizza which my dad and I were hoping to be hearty, but it came so thin and wimpy I literally thought they delivered from cicis pizza! It was truly pathetic. On top of that, the service was incredibly slow which was inexcusable for a drinking room not even 20% full. I will never return, and I'm actually quite disappointed to have wasted a meal on the Strip on this place.",1
"Friendly staff, great food",5
you can get almost all brands brewery and really good food,5
What a cool place for dinner. The hostess are so nice and our waitress was the best. This place is great for big groups. The beer my God the selection takes days to find your favorite but don't worry the staff is there to help. Dinner is served and super fast and oh my gosh yummers!!!! Yadi and David our waiter and waitress absolutely amazing if you come here ask for them.,5
"Yum! Yum! Yum! Delicious food! Excellent customer service! Well versed with dietary needs.

We arrived at a very busy time and were told we were going to have to wait 20 minutes (we were happy to!). Then exactly  7 minutes later I got the text that our table was ready! The hostess and manager(who I spoke to about our dietary needs- Celiac Disease/gluten-free) were both kind and accommodating! Our table was in the patio-ish area, and it was soooo pleasant! A much needed calm break from the insanity of the strip. The ambiance was awesome. The inside looked very high end and nice! Our server, Joshua, was friendly and well informed of the menu. We ordered promptly and it took only a few moments for our steaming hot, delicious food to arrive. Because the spicy rice and pinto beans were not gluten free, we ordered instead chicken tortilla soup and plain jasmine rice as our sides (we both ordered taco meals). The rice was, well, rice, but the gluten-free chicken tortilla soup was OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING!! I kept wondering if it was gluten free or not(I feel great! So I can assure you it is!)! Sooo creamy, flavorful, and delicious. Our gluten free carne asada tacos were on par with the soup, also ABSOLUTELY DELICOUS! Blown away with the food, atmosphere, and customer service of Yardhouse!",5
"One of the least crowded, affordably priced restaurants on the strip.  Awesome happy hour prices! Service was spot on and the place is clean and nicely decorated.",5
Huge menu. Food we had was delicious. Grilled halibut over mashed potatoes with asparagus and a sauce made from porcini mushrooms was cooked perfectly. Nachos with spicy tuna was very delicious also.,5
"Great food, my friend and I had perfect service,  and had a tremendous selection of drinks.",5
Loved the ambience and service.  You go for the beer 🍺 and really good food 👌🏼 Recommend,5
"This is a go to stop for me when in Vegas and as always the food didn't disappoint. We had the salmon and ahi tuna and both were fantastic. They make a spicey beer & clam type drink that ended up being undrinkable but they replaced it for me right away no questions asked. Our server Tony was a GEM. He had a lot of tables and a long list of items they were out of and he was totally on top of it and gave us the best service. Our only complaint would be the management. I stepped away from the table to order a round of shots for one of our parties birthday so she wouldn't hear and the bartender was so flustered you would think I had ordered a new heart, and then the manager stepped in and gave our amazing server heck for not being at our table to take the order without knowing the context. Taking a star off for treating employees like garbage for no reason...

I would probably think twice before working here but will def eat here again, and huge props to our server Tony for his 10/10 food and beverage suggestions and service!",4
"Great atmosphere. I had the bbq bacon burger and a Belgium Golden. The beer was tasty! Food was pretty good. My husband had the wings plain and they were good, breaded and fried right. It was kinda dark in there.",4
This place has great food and reasonable prices and they definitely keep you 6ft apart from other tables.,5
get the shiitake garlic noodles..it wasnt sweet when i had it in texas but sweeter here in vegas...it's rhe Bom,4
"The food was good, but the service we got from Dustin was horrible. We ordered an appetizer and then a pizza, but the pizza took quite a while(over 45 mins) when we commented about the long wait time, Dustin’s response was: “we’ll at least you got it”",2
"Love the drinks and the vegetarian options, absolutely delicious!",5
A great option to eat a reasonably priced dinner on the Las Vegas Strip with amazing beer options.,5
"Great food, GREAT prices, indoor/outdoor eating and GREAT hospitality... the waiter did have somewhat an attitude but my wife cousin started moving tables together (as if he DIDN'T hear ONLY 4 to a table) 🤷🏿‍♂️but it was warranted. WOULD DEFINITELY GO BACK!",5
Natalie was so amazing and made a last Vegas experience awesome thanks again for putting up with us,5
"Found this place on Yelp! Great find! Great food, amazing beer selection, good portion sizes for the price, which is reasonable. Expect to pay around $60 after tip for a half yard of good beer and a dinner. You'll leave happy!",5
Great food. Excellent wait staff.,5
"Great Happy Hour, convenient  Line Alley location.  Bar tender was first rate, varied 🍺🍻 selections.  1/2 price appetizers during Happy hour.",5
Excellent!! M-F happy hour. Kales was an exceptional waitress. Highly recommend.,5
"Experience was ok big place with lots of seating. Large bar also. Nothing very special about this place. Very basic foods burgers, salads, sandwich. Service was just ok could have done better. Went here because everything else around this place was packed.",2
This place has a great “wait line” system. They text you and keep you updated on your spot in the “line” so it allows you to wander off and check other things out. Great food - it came out so fast! The drinks were good as well. Great experience - Mike was an awesome waiter!,5
"The Spicy Seafood Jambalaya Pasta was TERRIFIC!! We arrived just as the restaurant opened, so there's was no wait. Service was good, restaurant was clean and we'll organized. I may have to go back just to have that meal one more time before departing.",5
Great experience as always. Heads up it' as busy  place.,5
"Highly recommend food super delicious, waiter was great and place and atmosphere were convinent and nice.",5

They have 200 beer taps and a great happy hour.,5
Really nice place Cynthia our server was so amazing!,5
"On the extreme side of good, excellent service, drinks with alcohol you can taste and great decor. Ordered two styles of chicken wings and bone in ribeye, all very good. Sides surprised us being so perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. We were not expecting this kind of quality, expecially being open so late. We don't have one in Columbus Ohio but will be visiting the one in Cincinnati soon on a weekend getaway. The menu has something for everybody, so take the whole crew.",5
One of the best places we’ve been for a quick bite. The Poke Nachos are ridiculously delicious. We will be back,5
"Nice ambiance. Upscale Casual a Beer lovers dream.
Big menu. Was seated quickly. Specialty drinks were delicious and food came fast hot with great presentation",4
The staff was friendly and attentive. The wait time was fairly short for a table. The food was excellent! I went twice at different times and the service and food was great both times!,5
Love the food had a ceasar salad with kale chicken and shrimp,5
Went for happy hour. Had a great waiter. Then he said our table belong to another waitress.  She barely showed up at our table. Food is always good.  Giving 3 stars because of service,3
"Really great chicken sandwich, the waitress are sooooo nice she gave me a free chocolate cake for my birthday. Everything was amazing",5
"What a great restaurant located right in the heart of Las Vegas Blvd.  We came down here to do the High Roller and enjoy a nice Friday out.

We came here and got a table at on the patio.  Our servers Anthony and Joshua were.super cool and very attentive to our food and beverage needs.

We got the spicy edamame, wings, lettuce wraps, sliders and kale salad.  Everything was great and we will definitely be back.

Oh btw they have like over 150 beers on tap.",5
Amazing place. Wide variety of food options. And a great ambience too.,5
"First time having dinner there loved it, the food and the ambience were great",5
"Food was great, but the margaritas had too much tequila in them. I had the Salted Watermelon Margarita, and it had no watermelon in it, it was practically straight tequila. But the food was great! Totally worth the price.",4
"The child at the front desk rudely said no when I asked if they had open seating at the bar, then I had her write my name down for the 15 minute wait, no problem. As I walked outside to wait and I heard the person who was standing right next to her say they had open seating in the bar area. She continued to seat two parties.",1
Very nice customer service and the ambience is nice as well.,5
Great customer service and it's my birthday 🎉 and I had chocolate chip 🍰 thanks,5
Take advantage of the happy hour. Great food and great drinks. 2 dollar off for draft beer and half off appetizers,5
"Sat at bar, always good food and service at Yard House",5
"Had a 45 minute wait on a Wednesday night. Everything we ordered was great. The Korean beef appetizer is a winner. I would have gotten it as an entree.

I ordered the 8 oz steak it was fork tender and delicious.",4
Great jambalaya!,5
"Great food excellent service been here a few times, would definitely go here again",5
"Good food, the service was slow. Our server spent 20 minutes talking to another table.",4
"Our time here started off not so good. We got seated and no one came. We almost left when our server finally came. Luckily she apologize and made it up to us with good service from that point on.
Our meal was pretty good and filling.",4
Fantastic food and it's a whole vibe,5
"I'm generally not a fan of going to a restaurant when I'm out of town that we have in my hometown but I found myself at Yard House despite that rule.  We did a weekday happy hour and I must say it was one of the best values just off the Las Vegas strip and both the food and service were excellent.  If you find yourself tired of the very high prices, give your wallet a break and your appetite a treat by stopping in.",5
Great place a must when in Vegas reasonable prices as well,4
"Great service, great salmon dinner, and we could watch the game we wanted! Will return soon!",5
I’m a big fan of yard house and this location will not disappoint. It’s in a great location by Linq and Flamingo and it’s a great bar. Super friendly staff.,5
"We hung out here for several hours drinking and eating. It was my birthday and the waiter brought this out,! Adrian is a great waiter! Excellent Happy hour specials and delicious food.",5
Great food and atmosphere. Great beer!,5
The crab cake sandwich was really good and is a nice size portion.,5
"Breakfast & Happy Hour: Definitly worth going. Early morning had a spicy breaded chicken with sage, sweat potatoe pancakes with a Honey Hot syrup & PickLes along with a Punch drink(alcohol). Went back diff day for H@PpY HoUr 3-6. Super Cheap. Pizza & Tuna Egg rolls. The Pomegranate drink was a bit sweet for my taste.",5

Food was amazing. We went to two different ones while in Vegas.  Both were great. The Jambalaya was delicious one of the best I've had. Decor was great and customer was great and I'm all about good service. Would go back when in Vegas.,5
"Even though I like to visit local places, Las Vegas was packed and couldn't get reservations anywhere. So we went to an old standby. Almost everything was what we expected but the all the spices seemed to be turned down by several notches compared to other Yard Houses. Not that it tasted bad, but just a little bland.",4

So much fun !!! Service was awesome and our server Kale was super sweet and efficient.  Thank you again 💓,5
Rude host. Beer list may be long but is unimpressive for anybody who knows about beers. A long list of industrial standard beers which you will find in most supermarkets.,1
"If a sever named Christian never came over, me and my husband probably never would of had food. We sat there for a good 15-20min before I stop a busboy for a waiter. The food was good.",3

Indians trust me u will be never disappointed here. Will be back again tomorrow.,5
"So amazing from the management to the staff everything was Awesome!

The manager Gabriel and the server gusts were epic not only were so friendly but besides being attentive they made us feel comfortable because we differently since we are beginning their shirt as everything was being prepared to our standards!

"Excellent food, the lobster and noodles was AMAZING.  Great service as well!!! Worth every penny!",5
The appetizers were yummy and are server John did an excellent job checking in with us refilling beverages and removing dishes as we finishing eating.,5
"Love this place, the location is clean, food is amazing and the staff is superb. Get the Truffle burger w/ Truffle fries! They were well stocked with a lot of beers from all around. I'm excited to find one in Cincinnati that I'm sure I will visit sometime soon! Good work and thank you for the great experience!",5
"Excellent beer selection! 185 beers on tap. Everything from light to stout, local, national and international. Staff is pretty knowledgeable.

One of my favorite restaurants period! I love this restaurant! Service has always been amazing and I love the drinks and food is always amazing!,5
"Always come here for dinner when in Vegas. Great food, service and beer.",5
Everything is reasonable and great tasting. Seated immediately,5
Blackened shrimp tacos vampire style and the calamari are soooooo good.,5
"Great beer selection, good food, the Truffle fries is not as good as they used to be. Vampire Taco was delicious!!!",4
Jacob theeeee best service 🔥🔥🔥 Seafood jambalaya was the best my husband had BBQ burger. Thank for everything,5
Las Vegas Yardhouse was on point! Great experience!,5
So glad we stopped here after a local recommended it. They have a little bit of everything from burgers to street tacos and everything was so good!,5
Had a drink and midway in my drink I notice a lip stain on my drink it was gross. They do not clean the glasses.,1
Food good atmosphere good bar service a bit slow,4
Lines tooooo long they need a different approach,4
"The venue right in the thick of the buzzing part of Vegas. There's a selection by of standard and eccentric food, which are all decent. There's a near endless supply of craft beer to try...aaand the beers come in half-yardie sizes. The bar tenders are friendly and seem genuinely keen to chat. Hard to fault really.",5
We went for Happy Hour and got the onion ring tower. 🤤,5
"Always good food, good beer!",4
I’ve heard amazing things about this place and was prepared to be blown away but unfortunately it was just ok. I stopped in late Sunday night after doing the happy half hour at the High Roller. We had to finish our drinks before we could get a table per their policy. The place was rather empty. We ordered the steak Cobb salad and chicken enchilada soup. The salad was ok but similar to very other Cobb salad I’ve had. The steak was overdone in some places and chewy in others. The soup tasted great. I really wanted to try the beer or the frozen mule but I’ll go back another time for that,4
"Delicious. Great Server, Michael",5
I've always loved this place and it's always delicious in all the cities I've visited and eaten here.,5
Awesome place and workers are number one,5
Classic place for dining. Excellent menu and fast service. Servers are very courteous and always smiling. Gardein chicken was delicious and healthy. Also fish taco is excellent. Highly recommend when visiting Vegas.,5
Service was perfectly fine and I'm always happy to see large tap selections. Hostess was not the most pleasant.,4
"Loved prices, apps, service, drinks, salad- entree was 4 stars(jambalaya)",5
"Went during happy hour and service was great. I ordered the pizza and clam chowder combo and added fries. Everything was great, but the fries were exceptional. Fries should be easy to make but not everywhere gets it right. I definitely would go back to get an entree.",5
Luv the selection of Various Beers!! Customer service was great as well!! Food selection is great as well!!,5
Friendly staff. They go to the extra mile to make things right,4
Service was excellent. Wide variety of foods to choose from and all of them are down well.,5
Great happy hour specials and beer! Had a bit of a wait to get in but they were able to text me so we could wander the Linq plaza until our table was ready.,5
"Highly recommended! The food was great, I had the poke nachos. They have a ton of beer choices too, something for every pallet. It is located down the brick alley between the Linq & the Flamingo. You won't be disappointed.",5
Poke nachos were my favorite meal of the trip.,5
"Great food, very accommodating to our party of 11.",4
"For the price the food was  slightly off. No one finished and only one loved it. But it wasn't bad, maybe it just wasn't for us. The service was great and they did a good job moving people along.",4
Loved several of the beers they make and the food was all nice. Staff was super friendly and really hustled. The reasonable prices make this place a rare find in Vegas!,5
"Good atmosphere, sweetheart waitress but little disappointed by the Maui chicken. I was told it bone-in breast with skin but it was not. I would try it again if I was staying longer.",3
Love all Yard House locations but this is the best one! The happy hour is amazing and I'd recommend the nachos for $7 and buffalo wings for $6 and kids menu is large and delicious!,5
"I don’t know if it’s only this Yard House is worse than in all other states we were at or due to COVID. The menu is limited, food is trivial... Tasteless and did not seem fresh to me. I have no idea why they put me those carrots which are not even boiled good. It could be more of mashed potatoes than two spoons.",3
"Reasonable prices, friendly staff, great calamari, excellent ribeye steak, excellent whiskey glazed salmon, the potatoes, grilled carrots, and broccoli complimented the main dish.",5
Love this place.  The staff are amazing 👏 😍,5
Great place! Fantastic steak for the price!,5
Yumm,5
Great service. Good beer. Good food.,5
"Service was great, food was delicious and made just the way I wanted.",5

Food was ok .... service was ok ...probably will not ever go back ...,3
Great food and drink selection without the strip markup.  Good apps and entre's,5
Enjoy dinner and drinks with an old friend there awesome service great food enjoyed ourselves. Kales was a amazing server!,5
Great lively atmosphere with great food.  Stopped in just to have some desert and was a great experience..,5
The staff is amazing especially my waitress Veronica and everything is so clean.,5
The service was horrible!!! We had to wait over 30 minutes for our bill. Our orders were not what and how we requested. The food was very bland.,1
By far some of the best food we've had out here for the price it was all amazing from the calamari to the street tacos to steak and shrimp it blew us away! Definitely worth every penny!,5
So damn good! Great burger and fries and Thomas is a great server,5
The. Vegetarian options are delicious! Would visit here again.,5
Great food.  Great service.  My mom and I sat in the enclosed patio area and people watched.  We had fun!  The Long Beach cocktails are amazing!,5
"Our food was delivered 3 seperate times and  everytime the food runner didn't know there was more.    Slow drink refills,  trying to enjoy conversation with family and the server was cleaning our table (asking us to pass glasses, silverware and napkins).  Tried to get the attention of the manager (Female short Grey Hair with Navy Blue Shirt and Tan Pants) however she ignored us due to the repremanding of an employee at the bar area.    We were passing time waiting for the High Roller and we should have passed on Yard House.",2
"You really can't ask for more beer choices, 3-6pm they have a happy hour. They food was really good, great wait staff.",5
Servers were very nice. We had a party of 20 and they were very accommodating. Food and drink was served timely,4
My favorite sports bar. The food is above sports bar expectations. All of their locations never disappoint.,5
"Shared a steak dinner with my
Daughter, steak was fine, a little pink for m y daughter! But it was  good. The sauces were delicious m",4
"We liked it's food before but yesterday all oilly, you can dap 2-3 napkins in that food. Not good disappointed.",2
"If your in Las Vegas and you want a fun sports bar with great food, great service, and really great food options, this is your place!",5
"Great food and drinks!! The watermelon margarita was excellent!! Had the fried chicken and mashed potatoes,  fantastic flavor!! Highly recommend!!",5
Great spot for watching sports. Great food. Strong beer list. Great service.,5
Food and service were good. The food was a little cool on arrival,4
Best fish n chips and Nashville hot chicken! Yummmmm,5
Yard house staff friendly and good food but the BATHROOMS OMG!! not what I expected from such a nice place. No toilet paper. tampons on the floor. it was dirty!  I’ve been to better gas station bathrooms!,2
The food was delicious and our servers were incredibly great and patient!!,5
"Great food and atmosphere. The tasters were great (2 per person are free). Over 150 beers on tap!

We had the lumpia and it was outstanding. The peppercorn filet was one of the most tender steaks i have had in years!

Try the spinach mashed potatoes for something different and delicious",5
Great food and atmosphere. Trae our host was amazing and that guy needs a raise!,5
We came in early for brunch and were seated right away. Portions were large and service was polite,5
Really good food at good prices. Definitely cheaper than other places around. Service was really good.,5
"Wonderful food, drinks and location. So much beer! Great deals on flights. First time here but won't be my last. Convenient in the linq promenade.",5
"So disappointing anymore as it is primarily a bar food joint now. All of my favorite menu items were discontinued; the steak sandwich, Vodka Penne, crab cake appetizer and cobbler are all gone. And they changed the presentation of the filet medallions, using tasteless mini carrots vs cut carrots. Not much for me to like anymore.",3
"Best burger, garlic fries are to die for and the brews are delicious! The waiter was able to recommend a beer that really fit my taste profile. I wish I had written it down! Oh well, I'll be glad to try more next time I visit. 10/10 I'd highly recommend :D",5
Great food and great friendly service.   The food was awesome.,5
My food was so delicious and the service was great!,5
Love their happy hour ½ price appetizers.,5
"Another great location by the wheel, shops, and strip!",5
Great service and great drinks. Food wasn't bad but not the best either. Would definitely come back just for drinks,4

Paula J. Arlington Texas",5
Great food and service,4
"Great place when everything else was booked, good food and good beer.",5

Our 4th Yard House.  Excellent beer selections & large menu of some tasty food.,4
A very large selection of draft beers.  The food and service was good.,5
This place never lets me down!,5
Grace and Tatum were great and the prices are very reasonable!,5
Friends grabbed me a quick bit. Delicious,5
Good friendly service.  Food was tasty.,4
Wondered into the Yard House as it was the only place open at 2:00 AM and I am very happy it was. Good choices and varied on the menu.  Also as the name implies over 100 beers on tap.  And dispensed in many sizes and lengths. Found the staff to be very friendly and quick with info on questions of what is on TAP. Location has an open patio for the better weather times and plenty of indoor seating also.  The lighting was awesome and the decor made for a pleasant atmosphere.  Will stop here again on my next trip.,5
Costumer service here is very bad. Waitres Don't know what they are doing just running around. Waited forever to get our foods,2
"Had really great drinks, waiter was friendly and food came out timely. Had the Nashville Hot Chicken which was so good! Love this place!",5
"Good food. Tacos were a little smaller than I expected, but the flavor trumped the portion sizes. Service was a little slow, but the staff members were apologetic and cordial.",4
Food is great here.,5
Absolutely great!! The food was delicious and our waitress Maggie was attentive and friendly. Great service.,5
Good food and atmosphere. A vast beer collection to choose from.,5
A little bit overpriced. For what we ate. Drink selection was good. Wait staff was very attentive. We will go back for drinks.,3
"We loved this place!!! We went with my Brother-in-law. We had a group of 9 and they sat us right away.  We liked the atmosphere. Our server, Joshua T was friendly and helpful! The food was absolutely delicious. I had a Malibu peach Martini and it was so good!",5
Food was great. Service was good. Overall good experience,5
"This place has good food, good beer, great atmosphere! Would come back in a heartbeat if I visit vegas again. Jambalaya on a pasta was the change I didn’t know I want. Lol",5
"I like this place. I gave a 4 star because at first they did make me feel uneasy as if I don’t belong there but after going to the bar and having a brief chat with Gustavo and him being such a sweet and caring person, I think I can see myself visiting more often when I come back. The Gardein is amazing. It’s vegetable substitute for chicken and you can’t tell the difference. Loved it.",4
"Every table around us that arrived after us was finishing their meals and we had still been seated waiting for the appetizers. It wasn’t until after we mentioned our wait time to the manager that we got our food. My wings came out cold and so did the burger. Not the most pleasant experiences. I don’t know if it was the cooks fault in the back, or the server who took our order, or the runners that take the food to the table but as a restaurant on the strip, full of tourists, you gotta step up your game.",1
"Went here on Memorial Day with my boyfriend for a little date to celebrate some things.  Marissa was amazing , super attentive and knowledgeable despite being fairly new.  We were seated after about half an hour , totally acceptable. We both got a half yard of house IPA and blue moon, respectively.  We also ordered the chicken lettuce wraps , so delicious with the peanut and sweet chili sauce ! Not enough lettuce for the amount of chicken but that's okay , plenty of chicken ! We ordered the truffle bacon chicken Mac and cheese (I ordered a half size and it was still so huge !) , The korubuta pork burger with truffle fries , and firecracker shrimp . The firecracker shrimp come with a little hush puppy like rice cake ! So yummy.  Then for dessert we had a beer flight , you can customize your own mix and match or choose from their premade lists.  We did a mix and match and found out what kind of beers my boyfriend likes (and doesn't like , lol ).  Service was excellent , we paid about 120  for beer , food , and tip.  Will definitely return to this location.",5
Nice and cozy place and food is amazing,5
Great food and Jose was super.,4
Food and service was good but my steak this time was charred.,4
"Poke nachos 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Had a great dinner with the family. Will go back soon.",5
Where do I start... First off Stephanie was an awesome waitress.. She gave great recommendations and the orange chicken dish was very very good. I was visiting for my birthday and I've never been to the Yardhouse. And for this to be my first time eating here I will definitely be back.. Kudos and thanks Steph for the awesome customer service😁😁😁👍👍👍,5

Food is always fresh great service.,5

"I'm telling you right now.... As a server.... Brittany is AMAZING! we didn't have a lot of requests, but the ones we had, didn't make us feel at all like we were being a hassle. Brittany was like a long lost friend. Truly. Thank you for making our experience amazing! We will 100 percent be back! Thank you. =)",5
This place never fails!!  Expansive menu and literally every item I've tried has been fantastic.  I'd give it 6 starts if I could!,5
The food was really good! Nice atmosphere.,5
"Drinks and appetizers were very good as well as the bartender which is where we were. Even though, the bar area was only about 1/3 full, we did have to wait about 35 minutes to be seated at the bar. Hmmm",5
"Friendly, quick service. Blue orchid was delish",5
They have tons of beer to choose from but what's really special about this place is their food. Presentation and quality of their meals are outstanding. Highly recommended if you go to Vegas and look for amazing food.,5
Gus and staff are SUPER friendly.  I came alone since I was traveling for work and EVERYONE  made me feel right at home :(,5
Had a girls night before wedding,5
"Service was slow and a ton of beers weren't available, even house beers.",3
"The Sweet Potato pancakes with Chicken was unbelievable!!!!
We could eat there 5 more times and not have the same thing, because their selection is remarkable.",5
I'll let the onion ring tower speak for my visit . Beware,1
"Very disappointing, out of many menu items, no ciders. Not an expected experience.",3
"Was on vacation, great location to my hotel and food was banging. Great service. Nice atmosphere",5
"very modern decoration, nice food with drinks.
the fan on the selling is crazy but is so much fun.",5
Good food and drinks,5
Nice place near the ocean.,5
Great selection of everything from foods to drinks.,5
Its was chillaxed inside and   the giant   Pretzel was bomb  great last night  in Vegas  stop,4
Food was great & inexpensive. Great atmosphere as well. Will definitely come back.,5
Delicious food! Make sure to go during happy hour,5
Good food reasonable price.,5
Just stumbled upon this place while on vacation. The fish and chips were awesome. The service was incredible. It was my wife's birthday and they gave her a beautifully decorated desert. Will return.,5
Great food. Vegab options was an added plus. There was options for everyone. The drinks was also very delicious.,5
"Delicious first time there the chicken sandwich, guacamole and chips plus the WINGS O.M.G 😋🤝👍👍👍",5
"The atmosphere was very cool. The drinks were on point! So good, we went back the next day. I had a salad both days and it was one of the best I've had in along time. My bf had the burger and liked it. The apps were nothing special. This is definitely a place I will be visiting often. If only for the drinks and salad lol",5
Great place for beers and happy hour would recommend this place,5
Food was delicious and drinks were great,5
"Horrible service, walked out without even being waited on after waiting 15 mins for a seat for 1 at the bar,,, beer menu has shrunk unbelievably,,, menu has shrunk tremendously too... absolutely terrible service !!!!",1
Food is decent and I definitely appreciate the vegan menu options.,5
"Great beer selection, over 100 beers on tap. The bartenders are friendly, they know their stuff and will make suggestions if you're not familiar with the beers they have. Just tell them what style you like and they'll find something for you. The food is pretty good too, I liked the Nashville hot chicken sandwich and the chicken tortilla soup. We don't have a Yard House back home so I make sure I always stop here whenever I'm in Las Vegas.",5
One of my favorite go to places with visiting in Vegas. Great menu and drink choices. Friendly service. Clean bathrooms.,5
"Always a pleasure to stop by Yard House when I'm in town.
Good service and a decent variety of food for those accompanied by picky eaters.",5
Great happy hour. The staff are awesome. Location is great.,4
"So good, check out the pork burger, chicken nachos, or the Korean beef appetizer",5
"Good food, nice atmosphere, and helpful employees.",5
Michael was our waiter. He was so nice and polite.,4
Really good food and its worth the price eat here twice,5
Great food and service.  A great space and location on the strip.,5
Im vegetarian so it was good that he have the most plant based options of all the restaurants at the linq,5
OMG the best lobster noodles I've ever had in my life.,5
"Good location, good staff, good food, good beer.  Big portions for the meals, will make you wish you had a microwave in the room for the leftovers. Varied menu for food, and tons of beer choices!  Prices were reasonable for this Las Vegas location.",5
"Great food, great location",5
Told no reservations. Waited 45 mins so we went and refilled our frozen daiquiris.  Stood outside for 20 mins right in front of them and when our table was ready we were told we could not bring our drinks in at all.  Horrible business.  You will lose so much  business w this concept.  Go somewhere else!,1
"The beer menu reads like an encyclopedia collection!!!
Great brews food and service.",5
Greatest place in Las Vegas hands down,5
"Never, ever a bad meal here or any Yard House!",5
"Stopped in for dessert, Mini Trio Sampler. Just right with a cup if coffee.",4
"One of my favorite chain restaurants. Excellent drinks, food, and selection. The happy hour is the best around... Lots of food choices for half off and all drinks are a few dollars off. The only food I would probably not recommend is the pizza (not impressive) and tacos (too expensive).",5
"I expected better quality and taste from a place directly on the strip. For the price I expected more than a bland roast beef dip. I could have saved money and stopped by Arby’s, which may have tasted better. The place wasn’t busy and it took forever to receive refills and dessert. I filled out the survey at the end of my meal and will say the same on here. While the server was great the kitchen was not up to par on this visit.",2
"Good food, friendly servers and fun atmosphere.",5
"Meat lovers pizza, bread pudding were excellent!! Sara was a gem!! Great Happy Hour prices!!",5
Great place. My folks enjoyed it.,5
Small portion sizes but large ticket prices. Street tacos were $9.95 each came with a little side of coleslaw or something inedible. Would say the food was good but the price to value is not there. They have an amazing selection of beer on tap if your interested in that,3
Delicious food. The server we had was amazing wish I could remember his name. If I come across him again I will add it. Will definitely be back. We dined inside and everyone wore masks.,4
"Amazing service Stephanie and Joshua were Amazing. Fast, attentive and very friendly. Keep it up!!!!",5
The food was awesome,5
"Everything was really good, service, food, atmosphere. This pretzel was huge 😋.  Perfect stop on our way to the high roller.",5
The drinks here were on point!! Huge selection despite all that's going on. Staff was friendly and welcoming and food was amazing! I didn't notice until after we ate there that there was an upstairs outside patio! Looked really cool up there so will I'll definitely be coming back to experience that atmosphere! 5 stars highly recommended!,5
Whiskey Salmon and a Belgian Tripel ... OMG 😳.... JUST DO IT!!,5
"We visited this location on May 1, 2021.

The Covid protocols were very appropriate and I really appreciated that they had so many hand sanitizer stations throughout the restaurant.

We sat at the bar top and had a truly exemplary interaction with the bartenders. The two gentlemen that served us were very knowledgeable about the beers, very upfront about what they had and what they were missing, and more than willing to give out a few samples to help us find what we wanted. Additionally, they made some great recommendations from the menu for food. We had some wonderful edamame, A nice California rolls stack, and some excellent chicken wings. I would personally recommend the traditional wings with the Korean sauce they are great.

The major downside of our experience was that they had very few beers compared to what they normally have available. This Yard House typically boasts 170 or so beers on tap. Because of Covid they only had 50 or so to choose from. While even 50 may seem like a lot, it is a far cry from where this location has been at its peak.

Despite being a harsh victim of Covid, this place still pulls it off very well. I will return and I will highly recommend anyone to do so. The value of what you get in given its location makes it a great Vegas spot, especially as they offer beers and cocktails to go.

I am excited to return once they have their full offerings and to once again able to experience the best they have to offer. Keep this one on your go to list for good value, good service, and good prices.",4
"Sarah was an awesome server, quick service, and delicious wings!",5
I love this place there bone in wings are delicious 😋,5
"My favorite go to bars when I'm in Vegas. Actually it's one of our traditional spots to have the tallest beer there! Always clean, and such friendly and attentive staff. My come to this Yard House location!!",5
"Great food, wonderful beer selection",5
We are on an American ribeye tour and the one my wife and I had was succulent!!! I like the way the whole team here operates and works together! Every movement has purpose! Mr. Tyrone keep up the good work we can't wait to go to Atlanta and try the ribeye there!!!,5
Great variety of draft beers!,5
Always great food and service.,5
"First off the place is immaculate I love the decor. It started off kind of rocky. Arrived and waited over 30 minutes for drink's that was ordered. ButThe server named Daniel was not fully aware of that ( Even though he should have been )  and when he was he went to take care of it. About 3 seconds later the manager comes over and apologizes and says don't worry about the drinks I apologize that the printer had broken but I got you. So the drink was compted. The food came out, the food was good infected food was great The service was great and three other people kept stopping by to make sure that we were okay so like I said it started out kind of rocky but it ended good. Great place with most definitely recommend, and most definitely will go back.",5
Very nice place and awesome food & service,5
"Great food, lots of options, and great service!",5
Carly at Las Vegas is amazing. Super helpful. And accommodating when you don't like something. There a sort of industrial vibe to the restaurant which makes it chainy. Unsure if that's a demerit. But in general had a good time and enjoyed the drinks and food.,5
Great food and really good bartender .,5
"Get the truffle fries or have them add truffle oil to your mashed potatoes, thank me later.  Can't go wrong with most menu items here. The chicken nachos are super impressive",5
"The food is amazing, gotta try the Firecracker Winges if you go.   They also have good happy hour deals & lots of beers to choose from.",5
"They were out of every single hour beer.  If you want to promote your own beers, try keeping them in stock!",2
"Great service! Our server, Angel was on his game.",5
When I say the 30 min wait was worth it...Dont sell yourself short by finding somewhere else to eat..We tried the Whiskey Glazed Salmon and the Garlic Lobster Noodles and it was cooked to perfection. GOOD FOOD AND GOOD SERVICE,5
"Found Yard House by accident after getting off the high roller and I must say it's a great palace to eat in Las Vegas.  We had a group of 8 and
The staff accommodated us with no problem . I would recommend getting the tacos and a yard of beer.",5
Amazing food!,5
"Good food, good beer, and good price.",5
Good food at every location I have ever been to.,5
Good food good service good drinks and not to expensive!,5
Good food on happy hour,5
Get the potatoes and brussel sprouts! So good.,5
The Steak was cooked perfectly. Loved the bread as well.,5
"A bit pricey, but it is Vegas. Good food. Jose is a very good server",4
"Great place for craft beer & food. Especially look out for the happy hour deals, the chicken nachos are fantastic!",4
It was our first time there. It was awesome. Will definitely be  back.,5
Fun atmosphere and great food,5
I love Yard House! Great customer service and great food.,4
Lots of good beer.. it's the strip so it's gonna be pricey.. but hey why are you here otherwise?,4
Lots of a variety of on-tap beers and amazing pizza!,5
Had a small issue and they were amazing to correct.  Highly suggest stopping by.,5
"Service is excellent, however the food is hit or miss",4
"My family's favorite place for our family dinners.
Staff is amazing, friendly and attentive.
Food is always amazing!",5
Great food and beer,5
"Prices $$$1/2$.... but damn good food. Customer service good! Good food, good treatment ...a damn good time.",5
"Everytime, just a chill vibe. Good tasty food!",5
"The wait was a little bit lengthy but we did have to take into consideration that it was a Friday evening (03/19/2021) and it seemed as if everyone was at Town Square this evening. After being seated we were offered a beverage. The atmosphere was loud, exciting, busy and fun. The service was very good. The crispy wings are just out of this world. We had the bbq’d ones and the sliders were to die for. I had a 9 ounce Moscato and my daughter had a original margarita, so damn good she had two 😀which she said were so delicious. My Moscato was delicious as well. A very nice restaurant for a kick back sort of evening. I’ve been to 3 Yard House restaurants in Las Vegas so far and this one ranks at #2, my #1 ranking is on the Linq with excellent excellent service & no waiting when we went on the weekend a couple of weeks ago & #3 is at Red Rock Casino. We will definitely visit this one again.",5
"Yard house, ale variety and delicious well priced food",5
"My bloody mary was great. French dip was a bust. Zero flavor, and my aus ju sauce was spilled when I got it so the 2nd half of my sandwich was sauggie.",3
"Its a pretty decent, affordable dining establishment located in one of the strip's most loaded, packed alleyways.",4
"Little portion for the value of the plate, and the dish I ordered had too much garlic that made me bad, and your food lacks flavor",2
Delicious food. Packed with major flavours and worth every penny.,5
The food is so delicious & SUPER SIZED! Go with a big appetite or a group to share with!,5
"Great food, huge selection of beer, and excellent service",5
"Nice location on the LINQ. Large selection of beer and wine. Kale Caesar was very tasty, large serving. Deep fried cauliflower was crispy and the blue cheese dip was perfect. The all meat pizza had a light, crispy thin crust with a nice balance of toppings. The outside patio was a great setting on a warm afternoon. And the staff were friendly and provided attentive service. The on-table tablet provided the menu, pictures of dishes and allowed for payment of the bill",4
"Loved this place.  Great food, awesome staff...best beer selection anywhere.",5
"Reasonable priced food, the food tasted delicious & the wait wasn't bad to say most places was saying a 2hr wait for a group of 8",5
Great for pub food and drinks,4
The atmosphere was nice and calming but the food was bland.,3
Our new 'go too' place as soon as we get to Vegas!  Great apps and drinks.  Great atmosphere too!,4
Nice place but we weren't able to get a steak medium. 1st one was rare and the 2nd was well done and dry.,3
"I ordered the Onion Ring Tower, the Boneless Buffalo Chicken Wings, and a Moscow mule. Everything was delicious and came within what I considered to be a reasonable about of time. Qe were seated on the patio area for a dinner after my brother's wedding and we had a huge party but they had no problem seating us all. We were at separate tables but we were still fairly close. The service was also really great we had one waitress for all of us but she was very friendly and was always making rounds to see if everything was going well. I have been to the Yard House in Temecula, CA multiple times but this was the first time I went to the one in Vegas, if I ever have the opportunity to go again I'd be happy to.",5
Stopped here before catching my flight back home. There wasn't a wait and all of the staff were super friendly. Ordered the mango mojito and the nashville hot chicken plate. Everything was delicious.,5
Everytime I come to Vegas we stop at yard house,5
"Food was awesome. I got the orange chicken dish with the jasmine rice and the bok choy.  The sauce for the chicken was a little spicy and that made it perfect.  The chicken was a perfect size and I was full from the meal. If you are a person visiting Las Vegas, check this place out. It is a little expensive but its worth the price.",5
This used to be my favorite place because you guys had the best truffle fries but now the truffle fries are bland and no longer have parmesan. The California Sushi tower was the reason I kept coming back but you guys replaced it with an awful spicy tuna thing that didn’t even have rice. Even someone who liked all the ingredients individually said they tasted awful together. It was just a mess and it was basically a pile of tuna and avocado and cilantro. Which all happened to be things I hated and things my boyfriend loved and he still couldn’t keep it down. I grew up eating here and the menu changes were beyond the most disappointing things I have ever seen. It used to be quality food that was delicious and great for its price. Quality has gone down significantly and please bring back the california roll because the tuna avocado nightmare still is diarrhea ing down my throat. Man i’m not even trying to be a karen this was just so disappointing especially for someone who grew up eating here. I missed your parmesan truffle fries and that california roll tower thing more than my dead grandma and you do this to me. I may just be on my period but the sadness is real and this is the third review i’ve written in my life pls I was pushed to this point as a cook.,1
Large portions...great prices,5
Service was great. Food and drinks were great!,5
Katie J. Best waitress,5
Great service,5
"Food and customer service was so amazing i went 3 different days while visiting Vegas. I tried something different each time I went and everything me and my partner ordered was off the hook delicious.
Steak was amazing cook just right, the salmon with whiskey glaze, YUMMM, The crab cake sandwich was great!!! All I can say is go try it yourself. Ill be back when i return to Vegas again",5
The food and experience was good it’s just that the chicken on the chicken nachos didn’t look or taste appealing. Tasted to watery.,4
Food is excellent. Servers are great too!,5
"Food cold, over priced especially fried crumbs pretending to be calamari. Rib-eye was way over priced. A great place for a beer and wings ( although those might disappoint judging by calamari ) but that would be about all I suggest !!!",3
"Clean and we were able to get a seat almost immediately.  Once seated we were kind of forgotten about.  A member of our party was not served.  After about 10 minutes out waitress walked by and we stopped her to tell her he needed his food.  After a brief wait his food was brought out, incorrect from what he ordered.  His meal was comped, but the service sucked up until our waitress realized her fault.  She then tried to be personable.  Unfortunately, it was a little to late.",3
I've been to this Yard House location many times. Every single time from the greeter at the front door to the server at the very end has been a memorable experience. Thank you! And even when a beer is out of stock it seems that the server knows an awesome replacement each and every time.,5
"Loved it! Cozy yet modern, with great music! Works well for both a classy date night or a casual round of beers with friends.",5
"Excellent food, short wait time,  excellent waitress (Yadi)?..",5
"Went for lunch, had the poke salad, the salad was really good but the wonton chips were stale and I didn't like them. The server was very nice and attentive. Had a nice lunch",4
"Food was fab. Drinks were awesome! Frank, our server, was the best server we had all weekend. Ask for him if you go. He was really great!!",5
"Customer service was great. Food was on the bland side, and beer selection was limited.",2
"Excellent food, great staff, clean, comfortable,",4
Tha food was super delicious and the service was amazing.,5
"We came here for brunch. I ordered the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles, which this place is known for. The waffles were super crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and perfectly seasoned. They tasted great without any additional topping. The chicken was good but not outstanding. Overall, the food was good but overpriced for the portions given in my opinion.",3
"Horrible service.. Food is great. Not the servers.. Servers need to check their surrounding tables at the time being she came and got our food orders, forgot our drinks and never checked if we were doing okay. Every time we flag someone down they would roll their eyes. Great service right ?",2
Always good food. Very reliable,5
Awesome loved it had a bourbon infused stout that I can't remember the name of but was soooo good,5
"Great service, polite employees and the place has a good vibe to it",5
Lots of beer to choose from and a very knowledgeable bar staff.,5
Worst experience ever. Ordered a steak medium well. It was well done. I informed the waited that it was not the correct temperature i requested. His response was im pretty sure medium well does not have no pink the steak is right. I informed him this is not my first time eating a freaking steak so he took it back. The manager came out and apologized and offered me a salad because my guest was already eating. Second steak came out cooked three different temperatures. I was over it. Ate some paid bill only 30 mins later to violently hurl up complete meal. Never again,1
"Place: its dark but well lit. Cleanliness is up to par. Floors are non slippery how it should be on all restaurants.

Environment: energetic, good for casual nights. Good music is always being played. They have TV monitors all over with sports channels.

Food/beverage: food are at good quantity, it is well cooked and very good at taste. Plates are on the big side of the spectrum but not too big. Wines, beers,ciders,cocktails are available. Menu is big many options to choose from.

Conclusion: don't get discouraged when you look at the menu, just try it, you won't be dissatisfied, unless of course is  of your cup of tea.",4
"Nice place, a super wide selection of beers to choose from...",5
Great food and amazing service.,5
"Was a amazing great food & beers, and awesome service!",5
Nice place good service and good food but overpriced,4
"Buffalo Wings were delicious, cuvee house beer has a great taste. Clean and spacious",4
"Food was good, service was amazing!",5
Our waitress Mazzie was. GREAT! The food was delicious.,5
"Great food, service, and value. My go-to in Vegas. Highly recommend. Especially during Happy Hour!",5
Very busy they need more help,4
"Food was great. Good selection of dishes, service could be a little more attentive.  Very clean establishment.",4
"Always love this place, good food, great beer.",5
The gardein wings are SO GOOD. The service was just meh.... really slow.,4
Poor customer service at the Vegas location! We left prior to entering the restaurant.,1
Will revisit on my return visit to Vegas first place I shall eat,5
"Good food, great atmosphere as always.",5
Very good. Good service.  We eat here quite a bit when are in Vegas.,4
Great food. Reasonable price.,5
Amazing food,5
Nice atmosphere and the Blackened Shrimp Tacos were very good.,5
"Good food, good 🍺",4
"Great food, great beer selection, kids meals are good selection if propper food at a ridiculously low price.  All around very happy",5
"I wanted to like this place more, but it just wasn't that great. It's a chain, and the food doesn't come across overly flavorful. What I had wasn't bad, but it just wasn't that memorable either. The beer selection was to be the redeeming quality, but unfortunately they were out of 4 different stouts which was nearly their entire selection of that style. The location in Vegas is quite nice, but I'd have a hard time going back and spending food money there. I'd try it again for a beer if they had what I was interested in in stock.",3
"Great food , but our server Carly gave us the greatest experience ever. 10 stars for her.",5
Good food and nice variety of beers,5
Please arrive early or make reservations. We waited 2 hours for reservation and the food was only ok. I would not return😞,3
Excellent place to drink something and eat delicious dishes,5
"I called over the phone asking if it was possible to make a reservation for my birthday dinner. Some lady Janae literally just hung up. I didn’t know it was walk-in only. it only took 5 secs to ruin everything. I called back because i thought it was SO rude to just hang up?? especially when customer DONT KNOW how their business is running like. i’ve ate here before and i wanted to come back, but i’m assuming everyone customers service is like that. i hope management takes tabs on their employees. It could’ve been an friendly conversation with, “i’m sorry but unfortunately we’re only doing walk-in”. EASY, so disappointing. do better",1
Amazing wings!,5
Very affordable happy hour for a Strip location. Wide variety of beers. Comfortable patio seating. Good place to drink and people-watch.,5
Great place to eat with family and friends on vacation,5
"Had a great time, food was good and didn't take long to come to our table. Loved our waiter edgar, can't wait to come back.",5
Not good service rushed food cooked in old grease taste burnt,2
Fried chicken sandwich was juicy & awesome after a long day of traveling!!!,5
Not good compared to what I’m used to from yard house.  Evvvverything was mediocre at best.  Wing bone in and out blah Brookie was not even warm .  If your not buzzed or drunk I don’t recommend,1
I've never ever had a bad meal from any Yard House anywhere! Everytime the service is great and the food is wonderful!! The  atmospheres are wonderful for any family! Also I have noticed each location to be unique and in a very desirable part of town. Enjoy!!,5
Horrible staff not busy food was ok had to ask for extra napkins water. Wait staff was slow and not very nice. Never again.,1
Great food great service,5
Great beer selection.Willie was very knowledgeable & helpful about the beers.,5
"A beer place without beer... 6 out of the 10 beers I asked for were not available...
On a Thursday...
Burger ordered medium was cooked as thoroughly as a McDonald's one, but being twice as thick was seriously overcooked... Manager did take it off the bill which is why I left 3 stars...",3
"Yard house ! Yes ! First thing comes to our mind to go dining ;) great food , great service, convenient locations and reasonable prices ! The nacho is a bomb ! Huge portion ! Good for sharing as an appetizer for at least four people. Chicken was sooo tender !
Happy hours !!! Oooooh ! Tell me about it ;)
Fantastic happy hours menu!",5
"Very , Very , Very good. Food was fantastic. Will be back there.👍👍",5
not the greatest deals for happy hour...,3
Super great food.,5
Great outdoor patio,4
Amazing short rib tacos. Great beer selection.,5
Mine was good but my friends was not. Sweet potato fries are great,4
"Love the atmosphere, loved the food, fantastic spot!",5
Awesome place to enjoy some craft beers. They have huge selection to enjoy. Pair that with the awesome appetizers and food. Overall very very pleased with the ambience and the choices they provided. I went in for the house later and can definitely see me going back for more. It's worth going....,5
Food was not as good as it looked. Waitress was ok but not very friendly.,3
Very good place to eat and the service was good as well. We ate here twice on our trip to Las Vegas. I recommend it over the restaurants in the casinos.,5
Good food pretty nice atmosphere.,5
This place not only has the largest selection of tap brews but an incredible eclectic menu.,4
"Went there Sunday night around 9 PM and couldn't get served at the bar. I was seated at a table and food was good, but the server was unfriendly and never followed up with me. I had to track her down to get my bill. Food was great, service sucked. She needs to find another job.",2
If you are ever flamingo casino its a must to stop by this restaurant..its great even though it's a pandemic going on the food quality is great...,5
Amazing menu! Huuuuuuuuuge beer selection! The long islands are delicious! Food was terrific. Service was fantastic!,5
We love this place. Large menu so you can find anything you want. And one of the best beer selections around.,5
Good half off happy hour menu,5
Reasonably priced mostly bland food. Korean beef was good tho,4
Service wasn't The best orders were messed up by our server. The worst part of this All that there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant. Food was good especially The avacodo toast,2
Every dish was delicious,5
"Food was amazing. Service was on point.
Anyone coming here that is a beer lover I would suggest coming to the Yard house. 100+ beers ready for you to try.",5
Awesome service and great happy hour,5
Great beers and great food. Service was ok,4
"Wonderful staff, wonderful food, and awesome service",5
Ordered the lunch special for €15 which by Vegas standards is fantastic value. Had the pizza and Taco soup. Both were very enjoyable and I was pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes. Great selection of beers but rather pricey for some of them. Theres a tablet/kiosk on each table for ordering and paying. Great for ordering another round but we had nothing but issues trying to use it pay our bill - all 3 cards failed to register correctly with it.,4
"There was a snafu with our desserts but the staff was so nice and forthcoming that it did not at all blunt our experience. Nice staff, cool environment, GREAT beer list. Only had desserts but they were both excellent. Great place for beer fans on the strip.",5
Expensive. Lousy service. Food? Burger King Is better.,1
"We had a party of 14 for dinner and had two members of our group go ahead to reserve a table while the rest of us changed. They told the two that at least six members of our party had to be there to be seated at a table. No problem! They left, came back with more members. Then, they would not seat them again because we were missing three members of our fourteen, which should've been enough to reserve our table per the instructions given before. We arrived probably five minutes after one person called us and let us know the restaurant was getting difficult over us not being there. That was on us, the bus was very busy and running behind. So we were all sat at two different tables. It was fine, but we're unsure of why the number of members we needed were changed on us. The drinks we ordered took fifteen minutes to finally be brought over, but we had to ask for them twice. My pomegranate margarita tasted nothing like pomegranate or margarita and was really not my favorite (maybe I got the wrong drink?? I'm unsure, but at that point, I wasn't going to wait 15 minutes for another one, I needed a drink). I ordered just a classic ranch salad and could not have been more disappointed. There were so many of the other vegetables (corn, carrot, horseraddish, tomato) and almost no lettuce what so ever. My friend got the Ahi Tuna salad and loved it though, so I wonder if I just got a bad salad. Since it was my birthday, a friend at the table bought me an apple pie ice-cream thing that was to die for, so that made up for it by far. The server was a sweetheart too. The place has a lovely atmosphere and the prices are pretty good for a restaurant on the strip, and there are a lot of different alcohol choices. I'll definitely be trying the Yard House again. This experience wasn't fantastic, but I'm going to chalk it up to it being pretty busy and me having some bad luck.",4
Loved this place. Food is delicious. Huge selection of beverages. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable. We had the lobster lasagna and lamb burger and it was incredible. The seating is spacious and music is lively and fun. Would definitely visit again.,5
"Walking directions from Google are a little weird. I had to ask people to find the location. It's near It's Sugar and In-n-Out Burger at The Linq. Great eats, great environment and great customer service! Highly recommend if you're near the High Roller and need something to eat that's not too expensive and pretty quick.",4
"Great beer selection.  Food was enjoyed by everyone, including a good selection of appetizers.  The service was really good, too.  The wait staff stayed on top of drink refills, kept appetizers and meals coming up timely and quickly.  Highly recommend.",5
Best fried chicken in quite some time.,5
Nice atmosphere.,4
Great beer selection and delicious food also very friendly staff.,5
Our server was great!,5
Almost as good as the original in Longbeach!,5
Convenient location in the middle of the strip.  Very good beer selection.  Good food.  Good service.  Very pricey however so be prepared.  Come during happy hour if you plan on drinking and want to save some money.,4
Good eaten,4
Wonderful server and great beers!,5
"This was my first time here, it won't be the last",5
"Great prices, and amazing food and drinks. This is a fantastic find while out for a night, you'll definitely enjoy yourself and SAVE SOME MONEY!",5
Always amazing food and always amazing service!! I come here for every celebration and this time I came here after my wedding with my family to celebrate getting married. Yardhouse made my wedding night truly special  thank you!!,5
Service was very good and very friendly. Pub style restaurant with music playing but not too loud that you can’t talk and have a conversation. The place is dark but well lit. I have been here a few times now and enjoyed it each time. We were seated quickly and food came fast as well with no pressure to order quick or leave.,5
Loved the margaritas & carne asada tacos 🌮😋 fresh ingredients!,5
"Fabulous food,  exceptional customer service.",5
"Good food. Great service! Probably too many things on the menu to really do any of them well. I would recommend ordering off their house specialties menu. Those seemed to be the best dishes. The other numerous options were alright at best. The service however was fantastic. A seafood dish was unsatisfactory (old and stringy lobster) and while we just notified the waiter and didn't ask for more, the manager came over, apologized, and offered to take the item off our tab. It was very nice, and they were all really helpful. Even before this, I felt we had fantastic service. Overall, if you have a group that wants diverse options and decent prices, I'd recommend going here.",4
Delicious food at reasonable prices.,5
Great fun and awesome drinks. Laid back atmosphere,5
Yard House brings my soul happiness.  Would love to know when you'll have the watermelon wheat again btw 😁,5
I'm excited about this place because I am not able to eat eggs and most fried chicken has an egg batter. Not this place! The chicken is so delicious and juicy.  The mashed potatoes were tasty and the biscuits were great.  I'd come here again just for the chicken.,4
Good food and good service. Prices are not astronomical. I would go back,4
"Vast amount of beer taps, we were there for brunch, which was a good deal too. Steak and eggs with a beer was reasonable considering the Prime location. The staff were all superb and I really like the tablet system for paying and playing games.",4
Restaurant was nice food was on the one,5
Love the tradition of the restaurant food is always good I've been to like four different establishments,5
Didn't eat here. But did visit another group of people. I looked around and plates were empty!,4
"The customer service is flawless. They are friendly and attentive and you feel welcome and safe.
Yard house is a sports bar/pub/diner with the largest selection of beer on tap I've ever seen. With everything from light, white to dark there is a drink for every beer lover.
A broad menu with everything from seafood, salad burgers, pizza to salads. Light bites to a huge meal or just a sweet, they have it all.
Either sit at the bar to drink or relax in booths (or tables) for eating.
Different sports play on numerous large monitors all around. It can get loud and isn't really suitable for children.
I've been here twice and I'm sure I'll return. Highly recommended.
.",5
"Pretty good food and drinks. Buffalo wing was very hot (spicy) but I liked it. My shrimp ceasar salad was good but had to send the shrimp back cause they wasnt cooked to my liking, all and all pretty good place",4
"Love this place, great beer selection and food is tasty. Can't beat their happy hour deals too. Service was excellent both times I've been there!",5
"Food was  very good, great service and nice atmosphere.  Large portions",5
Great food and good service,5
These guys make some seriously good burgers and wings.,5
Best foods we had in Las Vegas.,5
Always loved this restaurant. The food was on point. Staff friendly and has a good vibe. Highly recommended.,5
"Friendly, clean, followed Covid guidelines.. compliments to Julian server..  great ceaser salad with salmon and roasted turkey sandwich.. all tasted fresh..  nice music and not over priced for Vegas.. thank you..

Beer sampler was cold and refressing.. for 10 bucks..",5
Good vibes but lacks good vegan options on my opinion,4
Oh my god... the Poke Nachos are now one of my favorites...ever! Great service and atmosphere. Ill be back again.,5
"The nashville hot chicken, creme brûlée, and chocolate soufflé were good. The Korean BBQ tacos were okay but definitely not korean flavored. Didn’t care for the peach cobbler as there was a ton of the crumble and not enough fruit. Great service. Nice interior. Not too loud.",4
Whiskey Black Pepper wings!!!! So delicious. Wait was like 45 mins but worth it.,5
"Finally found a Vegas bar that has a real selection, reasonable prices and friendly service.",5
Great happy hour appetizers pizzas look for HH on menu. Chicken nachos a little cold. Nice place to chill and hang out.,4
"Friendly, excellent service. The food was good. It's nice to see things opening up in Vegas 😁",5
"Do not let the construction deter you from coming here! It's a great spot! Lunch with my bestie for my birthday turned out delicious. We had the bacon wrapped dates, crab dip and house salad. We thoroughly enjoyed the mistletoe cocktails! Yummy!
Spencer was a very kind and attentive server and we so wish we could have hung out more but we will be back, again and again. New hangout, I think.",4
Meet family here. Had some drinks and appetizers. Staff was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Food was hot tasty and fresh. Would definitely recommend.,5
Magic Hat #9 on tap by the yard?   Outstanding!!!!!,5
"This was my second time at Yard House, and again it did not disappoint. The happy hour menu is well priced and has many great options. The poke nachos were the best and most unique thing I ate in 2019 - definitely recommend!",5
Came for a Tuesday lunch. The drinks where alright. 3 of the 4 with us did not like their food.,3
Great food at reasonable prices.. (especially their happy hour 3pm to 6pm...  Great deals on appetizers and drinks.),5
Regular  food   nothing  special  about  it  need to   try something  different,2
One if our favorites!!,5
Cant beat 150 beers on Tap,5
"Great waiter. We had lots of fun. Good food but cold french fries. Fabulous, extensive beer and wine list. Cozy booths.",5
"We were only here 5 days and ended up eating here 3 times.  Every time we'd  try to venture out and try something new, we'd end up here b/c we enjoyed the food, environment and friendly staff.",5
"Stopped here to kill time before heading to the airport.  Best bacon cheeseburger I've ever eaten, period.  What an awesome surprise!  Great atmosphere as well.",5
Great beers!! Good meals.,5
"Great service, waiter was super friendly and helpful. Food was very good, served hot and timely. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and will go back myself.",5
"Didn't eat, but had drinks. Bloody Mary was outstanding. Spicy, tasty, just right without being obnoxious. Prices were reasonable given the location. Service was friendly. Recommend.",5
Super kind staff and very good food!,5
Yard House has a nice variety of options. I haven't had anything that disappoints to date. Love those Vampire tacos and not to mention the asada tacos! Very cool location behind the high roller. The staff was on their game and got the order right and it came out in record time. Awesome visit!,5
They had Chimay beer. I love Chimay beer!,5
"Despite the absolute chaos of being a restaurant on the strip, the wait staff is still very attentive and super friendly. The food is amazing, with plenty of options for a picky eater. A great place overall",5
Hot food and over 150 alcoholic drinks to choose from.,5
"This is a good bar/restaurant. The food was good. But our order had a twist, we needed something gluten free. Our waiter went above and beyond bringing a special menu, suggesting gluten free beer and comforting us as much as possible. It was apparently his first gluten free customer, but you can tell that the staff is well trained and educated. It also was not too busy at 6pm on a week day.",5
Food was great!,5
If I could give no stars rating I would😡 Didn’t appear that Yard House was following COVID rules. Manager Kim came to our tables and accused us of moving tables! Left establishment and will NOT return. Terrible experience!!!,1
"Kind staff, large selection of microbrews on tap from around the country (150 taps). The Elysian Space Dust IPA is great, but it's strong so they only serve it in the smaller of their two glasses. It's nice to see responsible alcohol service in a town like Vegas. The only reason they don't have 5 stars here is that there's limited seating for parties larger than 6, and their ""full bar"" has a limited selection. It's not uncommon for a beer focused bar I suppose, but a bar that serves scotch should have more than 3 bottles, especially if 2 of them are Johnny.",4
"Amazing service and food, our waiter José (amazing person) was constant with refilling drinks and gave honest opinions on food. HIGHLY recommend the poke nachos, very worth price. The ribeye was also very reasonably price and tasted exceptional",5
Tbh not to sounds bad or anything but my wife and I used to come here once a while since we are locals. The food was always good until yesterday I don't know what happened maybe is the covid? I hope they manage to get up to our expectations like it used to be.,2
"This place has amazing food and drinks at reasonable prices. On this particular visit, the server was attentive and delivered outstanding service. Totally worth a visit if your on the Strip!",5
"The menu feels like it has a little bit of everything. I got a lunch special, personal pizza and a salad. It was a very reasonable portion, big enough to satisfy but not so big that I felt stuffed. Price was good, service was good and friendly.",4
"I have updated this review from 5 stars to one star. After many previous visits I was told for the first time I would have to pay ahead of time. I have never eaten in a bar or restaurant that required me to prepay for food. I guess they think this 58yo 100% disabled veteran will ""run"" out without paying. Very insulting. I tried to talk to a manager about how this policy made me feel and he accused me of arguing. Not true. Just letting the guy in charge know I won't be back to a restaurant that that treats me like that.",1
"Food good, service excellent",5
One of the best most affordable places to eat in Las Vegas for the quality and value. All American bar and restaurant that boasts around 100 beers on tap. Also offering an expansive food menu that offers something for just about everyone. The BBQ chicken salad and street tacos are my favorite bites of food here.,4
Very good food. Not horrible prices.,4
"Very bad service. Wouldn’t accept a reservation over the phone, and quoted a longer wait in person than received over the phone. In person waiter/waitress was not hospitable",1
Very nice bar right near the highroller. Great margaritas!,5
"Huuuuge selection of beers! They advertise over 100 and it held true when I was there. Didn’t get to try all of them yet, but so far I’ve had six of the local beers they have on tap and they were phenomenal! Highly recommend coming down and grabbing a flight of beers to get a good taste and wide variety of what they have to offer.",5
Exelent food..,5
Always an excellent experience,5
We've found it to be a nice reasonably priced (at happy hour) bar/restaurant just  off the the Vegas strip.  Good selection of craft beers on tap.  Nice venue.   Would recommend.,4
Great for Happy Hour,5
"Watched the Las Vegas Golden Knights win their way into the Stanley Cup Championship. Great food, great drinks fun with friends. Staff was fun and and friendly. Great place for fun and great food with friends. Highly recommended. Red Rock Hotel and Casino",5
"The Combo Pan Roast is my absolute, most favorite dish ever!! Aside from trying to recreate it myself, I've never had it anywhere else, and I don't even want to bother because I just can't do that to my beloved Oyster Bar. There is literally always a wait. I tried to get lucky at 10pm on a Friday night, but there were over 30 people in line. If I would've stayed, my guess is that it would've taken 3 hours so I left and tried again the next morning at 9:30 am. There were 12 people in line so I only waited an hour before being seated - yay! It was so worth it.",4
"Great price, food was good",5
"Amazing. Went on a Thursday night and the food, beer, and service were outstanding.  We had the Bavarian pretzel, jambalaya (get the half order... It's huge), vodka sauce shrimp pasta half order (big serving still) and totally delicious blackened halibut with cauliflower instead of mashed potatoes.  Ipa's were great, not wimpy, and the server accurately recommended to my tastes.  Only drawback was that we were told there was only a""5 minute"" wait, but it turned into 15-20 min.  I was with 3 girls from 4- 10  years old that had sat in a car for 5 hours and were hungry and tired, so that underestimation made a difference.  Be careful because somehow my daughter was able to charge an extra $2 to the bill by playing games on the table menu kiosk (which takes credit cards so you can self-pay your bill as well!) She was unaware that she had done that. Definitely recommend!",5
Best service.   Best prices.  Best damn food.   Got some salmon.  Went back next day to try the steak.  Loved it.  10 stars,5
Had the grilled cheese and very dry and I over cooked,1
Good pizza...,5
Great place,5
Great food.   Great service,5
Had a very nice meal at the Yard House in the Linc Promenade. Our waiter looked exactly like Alice Cooper and he was very friendly and very attentive. My wife and i recommend it highly.,5
"Great location, food is consistent.",5
Delicious food at a reasonable price. Gotta remember this place next time we come to Vegas.,5
"Good service good food, great selection of draft beers. Attentive servers. Cool thing: they have a touch screen at every table where you can look at the menu, order, and even split up and pay the bill yourself between friends.",4
Host at front young guy was very rude absolutely awful and very non chalant seemed to be clueless about what was provided on the menu name was Jonathan . One Lady named Kayla was awesome very helpful and great customer service . Because  of jonathan I would not want to come back especially late at night,1
I've been here on four occasions so far and the service has always been spectacular. The prices are reasonable and the employees are friendly. The restaurant is also always clean. Would recommend this establishment to anyone visiting the strip as a resident of the area.,5
"Cannot say enough good things about this place! We went twice on our recent trip and the wait staff was incredible. Great beer selection and delicious, fresh food. This will definitely be a regular stop for us in Vegas and any other location that we find!",5
Amazing food! Margaritas were wonderful.,5
GO FOR HAPPY HOUR!! select appetizers and pizzas are half off as well as drink specials. Food and service was unbeatable. They have an extremely large selection of draft beer from across the world. Wish I would’ve discovered this place earlier on my vacation. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!,5
I had the jambalaya on rice and my God😱😱😱😱😱😇😇,5
Always love this place.,5
Great service and a great variety of draft beers.,4
Always a pleasurable place to visit and the food is great!!,5
Great food friendly service,5
Food was great. Only complaint was how the shrimp was seasoned on the spicy Jambalaya.,4
"Great place, delicious food !",5
"Nice atmosphere, food was pretty good, I wouldn't say excellent though.",4
"Oyster Bar is an absolute must try for those visiting Sin City. The place is 24/7 so there is really no excuse for not going here. The OG spot is off the strip but worth the trip. There will likely be a long line when you arrive so be prepared to wait a little bit but rest assured the wait is worth it. You absolutely have to try the combo pan roast at a minimum. It comes with lobster, shrimp and chicken. It comes with a side of rice but you will likely need at least one more order to finish it all. Pro tip: you get two scoops of rice with your second order. The pan roast is a great savory and hearty option. Add a little Chalula hot sauce and you've got the perfect combo every time. We also decided to get freshly shucked oysters which come with all the horseradish and cocktail sauce you need in a great appetizer. The house gumbo is also worth a try and comes with a variety of combos with shrimp, lobster, chicken, and scallops. The two entrees and oysters were more than enough to share between two people. I'll be a frequent visitor every time I'm in Vegas! Go try it!",4
"Not sure why everyone is raving about their deviled eggs. Yes they are huge and presented beautifully, but the saltiness!! What a shame. I finished them all and they are very filling, but I needed lots of water with it to handle the taste of salt.
I stopped by on a Monday evening, trying hard to find a spot, I got lucky at the bar. A big conference is going on and most restaurants are closed because booked by a company. This one is open for all but very busy. Bartender was very friendly, I got served quickly.",2
I tried calamari for the first time here. Delicious!!! Restrooms were clean. Service was great!!! The vibe was chill.  Highly recommended.,5
Everything was excellent from start to finish. The flavors of every dish were well considered. The ambiance was great. The staff were attentive and polite.,5
Garlic noodles with Lobster is delicious!!!,4
Great place to gather..,4
"Great service, Jessica was fantastic! Massive portions of food, extensive menu, loved the cheese curds. If you go on a Tuesday, all pints are $5, and it's a long list. Would definitely recommend if you want American food and beer at decent prices.",5
"Food was marvelous, tacos were amazing. Lobster and shrimp pasta was one of the best things I ever ate. Service by Lindsey was excellent, funny and charming and laughed at my stoopid jokes. We visited twice. .",5
Great place!,5
Great food as always!,4
Great food. Awesome drinks. Servers have little experience with hotel charges.,4
"Great beer selection. They must have 100+ beers on tap, from Hefeweizen to American IPA. Food is great to, portions are big and there is a good selection. Great deal on happy hour!",5
I was satisfied 🙂💯,4
"Sat at the bar, was in a rush, delivered all 4 of our plates quickly and everything we ordered was amazing.. I had a burger and it was cooked perfectly medium and delicious.  Drinks were strong, and great.  Great bartender, and service.  Will definitely be going back!",5
Outside dining,5
excellent food and great staff!!!,5
Good vegan options. Do not buy the big beer option buy a pint. As we thought we can share from the big tall glass. But there server slipped almost a quarter in pouring from one glass to another,4
Excellent place to eat. Wonderful attention.,5
Server had to be reminded over and over and food was still ordered wrong. Great atmosphere overall.,3
"Amazing food, drinks, and service!",5
Came at noon on a Sunday. Sat at the bar to watch football. Excellent service. Fish tacos were good. Magic Margarita was great! Will return! 😁,5
Awesome place right next to the main strip. It has a fantastic selection of beer and the food is great compared to your options in the area. A must stop for a decently priced dinner.,5
"the chips and guacamole were very good. great, fun place to sit and have drinks and people-watch. located right near the High Roller Observation Linq in Vegas!!!
🥳🤪🙉🎉❤💝🎉",5
Food was good great atmosphere cold beer and great service,5
"Was not impressed with the food. My meal came out cold twice. Not one to complain but you cant send my food back for being cold n then bring me back a hot plate with luke warm food. The service was not bad, the manager was very helpful and resolved the situation with the most exceptional level of customer service. I just blame the chef for being lazy.",3
"Forgot to take pictures, but the food was really good and the price was reasonable. A group split the chicken nachos (delicious!) And the lobster crab dip (yum!!).",5
"We caught The Yard House for happy hour before our High Roller time and loved it.  The tuna (Poke) Nachos were amazing.  We shared appetizers and sampled some beers, too.  Prices are on par with Las Vegas, but getting a few bucks off during happy hour was a nice bonus.  Family friendly.  Patio with A/C, too.",5
"Hubby and I shared the Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles. Delicious, especially with the bourbon maple syrup and hot honey sauces. Filling enough for 2 to share. Chicken is so moist! Excellent drink menu. I had their specialty BlackBerry Bourbon lemonade. Hubby had their Old Fashioned. Both craft cocktails were refreshing and tasty. Not super crowded. Inside the walkway between the Venetian and Palazzo. Nice break from the crowd on the strip.",3
"The front check in staff is absolutely horrible. If you go in by yourself and ask for a booth you will have to wait and wait while people who come after you get seated. I have come here before for the food and the friendly wait staff but will not be coming back again. Go to off the strip, always fast friendly service.",1
Love your food,5
We love their happy hours and views of The Linq promenade!,5
Great service. Great prices. Amazing food! Not even very expensive but tasted like a 5 star restaurant for sure.  We even went back 2 days in a row!!,5
"Always like coming here, the location is close by the big Ferris wheel at the end of the Linq promenade so a great place to rest your feet and select from their MASSIVE selection of beers and ciders on tap. Great happy hour specials. Service always attentive. Great!!!",5
Good food friendly staff,5
"Love the food and the atmosphere, Felipe our server was so good.",5
"If you want a choice of beers and a huge glass then this is the place. Great atmosphere, staff were friendly and pretty knowledgeable on the beers. Reasonably priced as well.",5
"Amazing selection of FINE beers.  And THE BEST poke bowl I have EVER had, ANYWHERE.  Reasonable prices.  GREAT food and over 100 beers on tap.  Try the poke tuna.",5
Server was very nice and frequently checking in on us.  They were operating at 50% capacity & doing plenty of cleaning & sanitizing in between guests.,5
Great service and great food,5
"I have been to numerous Yard houses but this one is by far my favorite. I dont know if it is because it is in a prime location in Vegas next to the wheel or the great service i get each time i go here.

If you are looking for a good happy hour spot near the Ferris wheel this would be the place to go. They do half off apps from 3-6. You can order anything off the menu and you cant go wrong.

If you are trying to get a good picture of you drinking with your buddies or girlfriends they have a half yard here that really makes for a good picture.

You should check Yard house out for sure if you are in the area!",5
"Service could've been better.  Even if a customer comes within the last 2 hours, they should still have a nice dining experience and not be rushed.  We knew what time you closed.",2
A great experience been to both locations and me and my wife will be coming back,5
Gr8 beer selection and food,5
This place is amazing the food is delicious. Our server Andrew was the best. He was funny and brought a smile to our faces. In total I love this place.,5
"Good experience especially with the virus going on, I had the crabcake sandwich, it was pretty good. Nice amount of crab, just needed a little crisp around the crabcake to make the texture more interesting.",5
"Good food. Good service. My only complaint was people at the bar were being a bit over the top. Sure it's Vegas, but it's a restaurant. Pull it together.",4
"Super cool venue with a great music video lineup, modern design, and tag-teaming servers who were surprisingly patient and hospitable despite how packed it was when I took my wife here recently.  She ordered the black orchid martini, and BRO...  it was the second best part of the night! 🍸😍",5
Great food,5
They always deliver well!!!,5
Great food and beer. Nice new bar.,5
"Nice to see a familiar face in Vegas. So many cool places to eat, but welcome relief to see our faithful Yardhouse! Good fare, great people and all our favorite beer! Plus the Pomegranate Margarita is a delightful way to stave off the Vegas heat!",5
Nice atmosphere. The food was delicious. Julian was our waiter. He was very professional & knowledgeable. Prices are not bad.,5
Very nice... We had a dinner before my daughter's wedding and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Food was good as well,5
"Good food and service! We have one in Atlantic Station in Atlanta- but never visited, now I am going to go.",4
Great place. Huge beer selection.,5
"One of our favorite places to go when we are close to one. Food is excellent, great beer and liquor selection. If you haven't gone, you should.",5
We had Jordan as our waitress and she did a fantastic job! She was extremely personable. She added good comments on everything we got on the menu.  If I didn’t know she was a waitress I’d assume she was a manager by how she presents herself. Five Star Service.,5
"Great place.  I will definitely be back.  The beer selection was impressive.  There are places with more, but their variety is one of the best.",5
Good food needs a little more seasoning.,4
Love stopping by a Yard House when I'm near. They were out of what I wanted and gave me tastes of similar beers until I found a new choice. Classy beer joint. Great bartenders.,5
Beer selection and food is amazing,5
"Stopped in last night with coworkers during our visit to the area. Super convenient location from our hotel. We enjoyed their friendly and attentive staff and good food. The poke nachos were amazing-- spicy and light. Wide selection or beer, but they were out of my first choice. Our server recommended a similar alternative which was just as good. Will patronize again on future trips.",5
"Ordered the Baja Fish Tacos. Comes with spicy rice and beans, but I chose to just have the spicy rice and a lettuce taco shell as a healthier option. Tacos were good, but rice could've been cooked a little bit more.",4
"The Yard house really took great care of us last night!! We kept growing in size and the hostess staff was so very accommodating. Thank you!!
A real shout out to Samantha and her coworker in expertly handling a large group.
Also, the food was great. Lots of diverse plates, and we're cooked just right.
Great job. ♡♡♡",5
It Was Amazing,5
Excellent service.  The food was awesome for a chain restaurant. They are changing the menu soon.  They took the Turkey pot pie off the  menu which was the best item.  Maybe they will bring it back in November. The service was really good.  We had 8 people in our group. The parmesan crusted pork loin was 5 star as was the tomato soup and fried chicken. Good value for quantity of food vs. price. Definitely will be back.,5
"From the amazing food down to the vast draft beer selection, this place is awesome. The staff are friendly, the atmosphere is great, and managers like to check in to make sure everything is okay. The only downside is that this place can become crowded, it is Vegas after all, so make sure you get there before the crowds.",5
This place has so many good beers. You can order them in so many large sizes. Prepare to have some beers. Food is good too. Service was great and the bar and seating areas were very clean. Next time in town I will stop by again. Lots of beers i have never heard of which is awesome for a beer fanatic for sure.,5
Love this place.,5
Ok not much on the menu. Ordered the wings and burger. I was not the best. My wife enjoyes her pizza.,4
Julius was wonderful.,5
Me and my girlfriend love this place we go at least once or twice every week so we calculated we go at least 24 to 30 times a year that's crazy this place is great service every time something bad happens or something doesn't come out right they've always make sure to keep us happy to come back service is awesome thank you guys,5
Awesome every time,5
"Love this place.   Best kept secret on the strip. From 3-6pm, happy hour is served.  $2 off drinks.  More importantly,  half price appetizers.  You can fill up because they have a large selection and generous portions.  Very delish.   Poke nachos are healthy.  Also can get sliders, pizza, dips. Can get an entire meal and drink for under $20 on the Vegas strip.  Can't beat that, especially with quality food and excellent service.",5
Outstanding food! Came here twice while in town. Ask for Jenn as your server! She’s amazing!!!!,5
Great place for a beer and bite !,5
Great food and beer selection.,5
"Delicious food (pretty much anything you order is going to be a big hit); very friendly staff. They were also extremely accommodating to dietary restrictions (my friend had a gluten allergy, they gave her a special menu with all gluten free stuff). Highly recommended.",5
"My wife and I ate here with a friend. All the meals were delicious, the beer selection was well above average, and the waiter and other staff were friendly and competent. We'll be back.",5
So good. Very happy we stopped by here for lunch. I had the Nashville Chicken Sandwich which was great. My husband has the mac and cheese which was also very good. I would give the food itself a 4.5 but the service put it over the top. The waitress answered all of our many questions and seemed happy to do it.,5
"So the only complaint I had was my $30 steak was cold when brought out to me, however the plate of food and steak even cold was super delicous!!! Our waiter Stephen was amazing and hooked us up with free dessert!!!  Great service hands down.",5
"If I were back home at the yard house there, this review would be completely different. Unfortunately where there are chain restaurants, there are inconsistencies in the food put out.  One of the best dishes the yard house puts out is their zombie quesadilla/tacos. I wasn't in the mood for something so heavy so I got chicken tenders (at least I thought I did).  What came out was a burnt flavorless cheese dish with overcooked chicken and unidentifiable meat.  It was so disappointing.  This was one of my favorite places to go and there were so many taps here! The food was horrendous, taps were mediocre. I don't even know if I want to go back when I get home. Go someplace else in that little strip, you will be making the right choice",1
Good food,5
Service was great. We were served quickly and all the food items ordered were delicious.,5
Great service.  Great burgers.,5
Great atmosphere and great food. Loved the Lobster Garlic Noodles. Would go back time and time again.,5
"Great service. We came here after leaving the restaurant across the walkway because of poor service. Definitely not the case at Yard house. Food was good, service was prompt and friendly.",5
"1st time at this location.  Great service, food, and drinks!  And kid friendly too ;)",5
"Food is absolutely wonderful.   Service is second to none.  Your server will take good care of u.  However, when I order a margarita, I want to taste the tequila, not just the mix.  Even when I spoke to the manager, he did nothing.  Very disappointed due to I love the Yard House.",3
"Great atmosphere, amazing happy hour and Jessica was the best behind the bar! Thanks for the great service and amazing food . Definitely a must stop when in Vegas.",5
"Was exited to try their ""Poke Nacho"" but a little disappointed when I got it...it looked a lot less exciting then the picture online 😕",4
Best American feel good food. We are returning tonight before we go home. Amazing vibe and great staff. Wish this place was in the UK!,5
"Have to give this place 5 stars based on their outstanding customer service.  We just spent a few days in Vegas, and we had dinner here one night.  I wasn't too terribly hungry and neither was my wife, so we ordered some appetizers as our meal.  My wife had the sliders and fries, and I ordered the crab cakes, and a few drinks.  The sliders were excellent, as well as the fries, and my Moscow mule was great.

But... the crab cakes were not what I was expecting at all.  They're not really a typical crab cake like you'd find in a dedicated seafood restaurant.  I didn't care for them at all, and the waitress noticed that I hadn't eaten one of them.  I was ok with it, I shared my wife's sliders, but she went and told the manager who came over and chatted with us, said he would take them off our bill.  He was from the East coast, so he knew a bit about what a crab cake should taste like!  All in all, excellent customer service, and the drink menu and ambiance are very nice.  Nice patio, too.  Will definitely go back.",5
Great place. Had a couple of issues with the food we ordered. Managment tried to make things right with our party. I would go again to give them another try.,3
It was excellent!!!,5
"Best dinner we had while in Vegas! Had a drink at the bar while waiting for our table. Great beer selection! Our waiter, Brandon was awesome. Food was GREAT! Definitely recommending this one!",5
"Not good! Med-Well steak should not be burnt, potatoes were all cheese and the broccoli had zero flavor! I don't want to go back....unless for a beer!",1
"Came here for brunch and had a great server and amazing food. Corn Beef Hash was amazing, potatoes were crispy and fresh cut, Breakfast Burger was massive and came witha delicious maple sauce. I'm pregnant but for the rest of you there are $15 bottomless Mimosas or Bloody Mary's when you have an entree. Great spot!!",4
Food was off the chain as well as the service.,5
"As solid a food offering as any of their only locations. Our only gripe was that they have a limited happy hour. It is only offered during the week from 6-9 pm. The late night happy hour was sorely missed, especially in an area with such high competition for better deals close by.",3
Diet coke was a bit flat,4
Everything was perfect,5
"AMAZING. Sushi nachos are deadly and the green tea shot is delicious (big, though!) We had an issue with one of our appies and the waiter and manager handled it impeccably. Took it back, made a new one fresh, took the price off the bill and ensured we had a couple of free drinks too. Perfect service.",5
"Not many things to say about this place. Food and service are ok.
Was expecting more",3
"We fell into this place by accident, just looking to cool off from the Big Bus ride. Walked in during Happy Hours and was promptly received by Pablo who was a great host and Waiter. Recommended​ some great food and drinks and I wish we could have stayed longer than 1.5 hours. The Yard House is calming, cool and upscale but the prices were much less than I expected! Definitely on my list to return to next trip to Vegas and asking for Pablo again!",5
Met out of town family for dinner and were there quite a long time.   Drinks were being ordered and they were great with us still sitting there.  Nice atmosphere.,5
They were crazy busy but still got my wife and I in quickly. Servers were attentive and Friendly.  We both ordered the pepper coated steak which was delicious in spite of being cooked more medium than medium rare. We would definitely go back.,4
"I love eating here, food and service is great. I just got a hair on my drink the last time i went that's why i gave it 3 stars.",3
"Great place,  we tried in Vegas and San Diego.  Happy hour deals are amazing!...  We'll definitely keep chasing the chain, great selection of beers!!!  🍻",5
The food is always good,5
"Really great restaurant in a fun location for people watching. Huge menu and very good cocktails. I ordered the chicken rice bowl and wish I had ordered something else, it wasn’t as good as I thought it would be for the price. Still, you can’t beat the location and vibe this restaurant has. Service is good too.",4
Great service. A wide variety of food to fit any diet. Beers from all over the world. Huge space. Great music. We kerp coming back to this spot. Keep up the great work!,5
"truly love this place. Come to Vegas a few times a year and have tried several sports bars.    the only legit place to watch games and grab a beer without sacrificing food quality,  gimmicky   ""drink specials"" that's only a alternative way to screw over guests.   In fact quiet this opposite.  they have an "" ALL YOU CAN DRINK BRUNCH"" til 2p for $15.  that's like paying for 2 Vegas priced beers and the rest is FREE. it was almost  too good to be true...I asked for fine print details...there were none. Drink up, catch a few games, eat  some damn good food.",5
"Wow, what an amazing experience. Friendly service, excellent food and Oh what a selection of beer! Over 140 unique, craft selections, even some local brews. Tough to find good beer on the strip, but not here. This is a real gem. We went for happy hour and were delighted with fresh food and good times. Highly recommended while in Vegas!",5
"I've been working in this industry for years and seldom get such an amazing experience. And I rarely post. Come down, ask for Stephen. I'll bet you enjoy it as much as we did!",5
There Salads and Tuna Roll are fantastic.,5
Great service! Great food! Great atmosphere! I got the fried mac and cheese and margherita pizza. Both were pretty good.,5
Went here for happy hour drinks and starters. Great selection of drinks and the food is great as well.  Definitely come here during happy hour it's well worth the visit.,5
"Stakes are delicious :) The place is huge and the atmosphere in the night is welcoming. You can try various draft beers there. The prices are not so high compared to other restaurants in Vegas, but is still expensive. If you want to eat or just drink after high roller , I think the place is perfect :)",5
Great beer menu.  Really good personnel working there.  Menu sounds great but falls short in reality.  Been twice and think there's better choices if you're eating and not beer sampling.,3
"If I am traveling and near a Yard House, chances are I will visit at least once if I looking for a great meal or a nice place to relax with a over 100 tap beer selections to choose from.  Staff are always friendly and the food is consistently great.  The Vegas location is a little tucked away, but huge menu will be sure to satisfy any taste.",5
Amazing food and service! Vegan options too!,5
"Fantastic food. Burgers were perfectly cooked, same goes for tuna tataki and incredible truffle fries.
5 pages of Beers from everywhere around the world.
One of the very best spots in town",5
Great service all the way around! Servers were the best! Food was excellent! I had the salmon with cheese and vegies. Fabulous! Thank you!!,5
Delicious food! Fish and chips plate was very good it comes with 2 dipping sauces spicy tartar sauce and a spicy mayo..yummy😗,5
Vampire tacos are worth the trip! Great food and beer selection! They have a $15 all you can drink special. Worth checking out!,5
Good food and big beers,4
Its hard to know that this restaurant its good from the outside but once that you go inside I can tell that the food and the service are amazing including good prices,5
Excellent. Great server.,5
"Went here for the bloody Mary and was not disappointed, cones with a boiled egg with seasoning and peppered bacon on top of a nicely kick bloody Mary,  in itself a starter and drink but will Definitely get you going on the morning. Has 40+ beers on tap. Waitress was nice, had the turkey sandwich and tomato soup but the menu has a lot of option from sushi to tacos and much more. Some good eating and drinking.",5
"Great crunchy ahi tuna salad, excellent burger. Incredible selection on the beer menu and the home brewed ginger beer is awesome. You can take your drink to go if you don't finish it!",5
Beautiful nice employees and good food,5
"Great service out the gate, a large beer selection and tasty food.",5
"Fun, decent bar food and great selection of beers and mixed drinks. It is a fun atmosphere and the service is tight. The bar tenders are attentive and the wait staff is fast. The food was good bar food.",5
Good chain restaurant for beer and pub food. Lot's of beer options with a very helpful menu for choosing your favorite libation.  Almost every pub dish you can imagine is available from wings to vegetarian chicken dishes.  This Vegas locale is a great place to watch the game.,4
Had an amazing casual date night here tonight. Food was amazing and did I mention it was during Happy Hour so appetizer were half price along with drink specials as well. Definitely will be going again,5
Great service and happy hour specials!,5
"Unfortunately I have to give this place at least a star to post the review. We love Yard House but this experience was the worst I had in Vegas so far. We waited for about 5 minutes to get seated, the girl at the front desk took us to the table, I took my jacket off, sat down at our booth. Well....another waiter came with a bigger group of people and we were told to pretty much get up and the girl who brought is to the table told us ""I'll come find you up front"". We pretty much told her not to bother and left. Not the customer service I would expect from a place I frequently go (at least once a week). Will not go back to this location and will advise all my friends, relatives, acquaintances to also avoid the place on their trips to Vegas.",1
Food was decent.  Drinks were good..waiter was great..  definitely would return in future,4
"Was sat at a dirty table. Then served semi decent food. First ice tea came out without lemon then the second had two?
The beer selection is above average but the lunch time staff sucks.",2
Pricey. Good but not amazing. Crowded noisy of course. service is good. I would say there's a reason to not go here necessarily. I just think it's a little overpriced. More LA prices than Las Vegas prices. At least off the strip,4
Angel was a fabulous server. Overall a do fearful dining experience.,5
"Had the Nashville Chicken Sandwich and the mango mojito. The sandwich was the best chicken sandwich I've ever had, it was marinated perfectly. The mojito was just as good!",5
"The Nacho platter is huge, a shareable size. I got it with the chicken but it would of been better if the chicken was shredded instead of chunked...i left all the chicken on my plate. My advice would be to get the nachos without any meat",4
"Delicious, great service",5
It was very good at good price,5
The food is so bad now. Gross. Used to be ok. At least the service was decent. That's the only reason I gave it any stars. Food gets a zero. No flavor and really dry,2
A+ experience,5
"St paddy’s day is hectic enough. Astonished at the service provided by Stephen. Very helpful, attentive, and nice! In spite of it being extremely full, he stopped by frequently. Kept our glasses filled. Thanks Stephen!!!",5
Food OK. Great location and good vib. Wait staff just OK,3
Awesome food and atmosphere! And more beer on tap than I've seen in a long time. Highly recommend!,5
Not as busy due to Covid. Love their food; service was excellent.,5
Pretty good food and service! Coconut shrimp were tasty!,4
Good food good service,4
Amazing place....we had a great time! We had a very large group....and all of our food came out at the same time! Our waiter was amazing! Highly recommend!,5
Closed at 11 pm.  We didn't get sat until 1045.  After we paid they turned up all the lights on us instead of letting us finish our drinks.,3
Nice location and great selection of beers.  Great food and very good food and service.,5
Nice get togethers,5
"A must go!! We love this place. Always great food, service and atmosphere",5
Good beer,5
Great place for breakfast too. Good specials on morning drinks. 😝,5
"Amazing selection of beers.  Staff knows their stuff,  too!  One of the best parts of our trip.",5
"Piss poor (lack of) service. Worst I've ever experienced at a yard house. Middle of the day, very few customers, tons of staff. Waited 16 minutes without anyone even asking if we wanted a drink. Called the server on their tablet, no response. Waved at the servers and they just turn their back and act like they don't see us. Got up and walked out. Will never return. Two thumbs down. I would give zero stars if I could.",1
"Love this place, it's so good I went back again. Massive choice of beers on tap, and the food was great too. I ate the boneless chicken bites in buffalo sauce and they were lovely.
Friendly service and a good all round experience.",5
Always a good place to eat.,5
"Always an odd memory of this place. Was having a beer here when the shooting happened down the strip in 2017. People were panicking about potential second shooters at the time and everyone ended up rushing into the kitchen as it was away from the windows. The staff then led everyone out of there and upstairs and then made everyone exit via the fire escape saying that a member of security was down there to direct people to safety, there was no one there and people just started running all over the place to try and get into other bar/restaurants to try and hide.
That said they comped everyones bar tabs so that was nice I guess.",1
A little expensive but it was great and the waitress was very nice!,5
"I ate here after getting after getting off the the high roller during the Oktoberfest menu, I have to say the curry wurst poutine was amazing. Yes i was a little happy from the drink on the high roller, but a 40 0z beer and amazing food and service topped the night. I want that recipe is was so good, thank you for a wonderful experience.",5
Food and drinks were bomb!,5
Great Service,5
Jessica our server was awesome both nights we went. She made excellent recommendations for food and drinks. Prices were reasonable.  Food service was prompt and the food met our expectations.  We will go back every time we visit Vegas.,5
Great food,4
We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of food at Yard House! Excellent service and good range of vegetarian options for those who need it! The Happy Hour provides excellent value. We ended up going 3 times in the 5 days we were in the city!,5
"Wonderful beer selection! Some of the best around there in Las Vegas! And quite a wide variety as well; there is something for all beer drinkers on tap. Hop bombs, big stouts, barrel aged beers, but also sours, fruit beers, and lighter ales and lagers. The bar staff were all very friendly, helpful, and engaging while we were there. The only complaint was that many times I or my companions ordered a beer from the menu, only to find that it was out. I wish there was a better way to keep the menu up to date, but I understand it can be difficult in a high volume location.",4
"Almost surreal how affordable and good this place is!  Sits neat the linq  which is the cleanest, classiest place on the strip.  The service was great.  The happy hour menu is unreal.  I had the clam chowder and was astounded...best ever!  Will revisit the yard house many times!",5
One of the best kept secrets in Vegas before 5 p.m. lunch specials $11 and very super secret special on Tuesday $2 taco. Don't tell no one.,5
good service... great food.. good atmosphere.. a can't miss..,4
"The food was excellent. The grilled cheese with bacon and tomato soup took me back to my childhood. Salty, cheesy, very comforting. The three taco combo is good and you can mix and match your tacos. The hummus is a decent size app and the hummus had olives and edamame in it which is interesting but still delicious.

Great place, will visit again.",5
What is the dress code?,5
"Been there multiple times. First 2 or 3, great, then I found that the quality of the food was not always the same. Not bad, but it's not a cheap place. The selection of beers is almost unbeatable, of course.",3
"Good food, great service, giant beers... What else could you want. Food came out hot and quick.",5
"I was so disappointed in my food. My husband food was okay, his veggies were cold. I ordered the pasta with shrimp and lobster. The pasta was old, hard around the edges and stuck together. I got 2 shrimp and my lobster  was cold like it was just thrown on the plate.  Very disappointing",2
Great Yardhouse. Its a chain but each one has many distinct beers. The service is very good and the waits here are pretty minimal. The happy hour is available in the entire restaurant and is a great deal.,5
"Appearance of the restaurant is very nice and cozy. I did not like the items I ordered. Artichoke and spinach dip wasn't all that tasty and they serve you about 3 tablespoons with a plate full of chips and tortillas, rip off for the price! The spicy jambalaya was very saucy and wasn't the best taste. However, my son enjoyed the buffalo wings!",3
Great pizza!,5
"We got an assortment of appetizers. Nothing crazy, but every item was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. Even the sliders came on great bread. Reasonably priced for the Strip.",5
"Incredible beer selection, service was great and the food was delectable.
We had the onion rings, burger, the Mac and cheese and Korean tacos and it all surpassed our expectations. Prices were really good compared to most places on the strip.

I can't recommend this place enough.",5
Amazing amazing everything is amazing! I wish they were closer and in Canada! Best ambience great service excellent food and drink! Specials everyday make it hard to avoid!,5
This place has a great selection of beer. Good location too,5
party on 6 ladies that have not seen each other in a long time... we are traveling nurses and see a lot of death and dying.   the Manger tonight came over and shut us off from drinking... I can honestly say we are in no way intoxicated ... we just want to have a lot of laughs and fun.. I believe the manager should have truly accessed our level of drinking.   just because friends get together and let you their hair/ inhalation down does not mean drunk.. we left there to finish our night that deserves our time and money.  waitress Dakota was wonderful!  don't spend your money at this establishment....,1
I love there pasta they makes worlds best pasta. And the staff were really great and very respectful toward the customers.,5
"Cool place for a drink or food. Service was great, food was great - it was ALMOST perfect! Thanks for the awesome service Yadi! If I remember correctly, the have something like 100 different beers on tap - you should see the bar. It's massive! Happy hour drink and appy specials are brilliant. When in Vegas, go there! You won't be disappointed!",4
"Brief hiccup on order, we ordered cheese curds and  had a piece of calamari mixed in... wife isn't a fan of seafood. They got a new plate and made the order right. Also side note, if looking for a specific beer, ask the bartender, they might have one not on the list.",5
Great beer and spirit selection. The bartender was very nice and attentive as we sampled several beers. Nestled in a graet little area with other restaurants and shops near the Flamingo.,5
Awsome service,5
"i have been in two cities boasting a yard house, and cannot be disappointed in either.. bar food is great, beer selection is outstanding, drinks are well made, staff is friendly and courteous, have a good time",5
"We've been here before and loved it. The food was good this time, but cold. The service this time around was terrible! Service was slow and we didn't get things we asked for.",3
The food was great and our waitress Stephanie was Awesome,5
"Great food, awesome service and CORONA ON TAP!",5
"Delicious burger's, great atmosphere!",5
"Next time you’re in Vegas, check out Yard House. Highly recommended! They’ve got super friendly customer service, the atmosphere and great food. The place to go for a great meal and a great time. It’s on the promenade, between the Flamingo and LINQ, next to the Ferris wheel.",5
Cheap happy hour,4
Definitely a good place to go of you are undecided on food or drinks. They have something for everyone and have happy hour specials. The location at the LINQ is perfect for shopping and entertainment. The food and drinks are good and bathrooms are clean!,3
Food was cold. Service was terrible. The only reason for three stars was because of Gus. We waited 15 minutes to even be greeted at the bar. I’m a bartender and I ordered a Manhattan and the guy charged me 2.50 for it UP which wasn’t even what I ordered. And ordered drinks during happy hour and the bartender tried to charge us full price. Our food was so cold we had to send it back. It also took the bartender about 30 minutes to clean up past guests mess from the bar. Didn’t even wipe it down. Gus wasn’t even the one taking care of us. He seemed to be the only person behind the bar who cared and for that I really want to thank him.  I’m from Phoenix and go to Scottsdale location often and it’s always great. Really disappointed by this location.,3
"Nice place to go if you want a clean, well staffed, sports oriented bar/restaurant. Their happy hour is pretty good. They are a little on the spendy side but I've never had a bad meal there. Overall, if you're downtown and looking for a trustworthy, easy dinner go here!",4
"Great service and food.  Also, beer selection  is unmatched.  Hit it every time I am in Vegas.",5
Our last night of a fantastic holiday in vegas spent in a great restaurant. Food and staff were great thanks all,5
Great beer selection (unless they are our of it). Great food (unless they are out of it). Great servers (unless they are having a bad day).,4
"Disappointed, appetizers were the best, main course, not so much, left most of it on our plates, wish we had just ordered more appetizers",3
"Just had beers at the bar, but such nice bartenders and beautiful building!",5
"We enjoyed happy hour and our server Angel was amazing! He helped us choose some options and helped us make some great choices! We had poke nachos, boneless buffalo wings and a pb nitro brew. Everything was delicious and well presented. Nothing I could honestly complain about! So earns my 5 stars if not more.",5
"Food was good, service was fast, and pleasant. I will say this, the food IS greasy. Atmosphere is nice too, not a bad family spot.",4
Yard house is always great our bartender Jason was awesome and very friendly would always recommend this place to anyone,5
Tons of beer to choose from and poke nachos to die for,5
Good pricing for LV these days. Great beer and food selection. Staff is wise in all things beer!!!!,5
"Great place, good food. Nice service. Definitely will return!",4
Great happy hour prices!,5
Came with 15 paying customers 7 people at front desk no one could handle request they put us off for 45 minutes. we asked after 1 hour.  They could not handle questions had to call mgt. Good food bad people organizational. Menus moved from one side of desk to another  but not the customers,1
Patrick was amazing.  He took exceptional care of us.  All 6 of us...,5
"Got dinner here on a Friday, without a huge wait; great experience. Good music on, great menu, tons of beers and cocktails available. Our server, Angel, was amazing. Gave some great suggestions for beers that we liked so much we wrote them down. My wife and I both got steaks, and they were excellent. Who would have thought broccolini could be so good! Will make this a regular stop.",5
Absolutely fantastic burger!!  Great service and comfy atmosphere!  Very reasonable prices!,5
Food is fabulous!  Our server very nice and fantastic smile every time she checked on us! This will definitely be one of our spots every time  we're here.,5
"Good food, great portions,  great service",5
The burger was dry and poorly dressed. The fries were lackluster and soggy. I've had better food at fast food chains that cost 1/3 as much. Our waiter also seemed to forget we were there.,1
A wonderful experience to say the least. And probably some of the best food I’ve had yet in Vegas. Perfectly done calamari and a delicious salmon with za’atar spices with a surprisingly good salad to go along with it. I wish I could come here more often.,5
"We've been here a few times, and the beer selection is great. Good location, too. Last time we were here we met some friends and talked all night long. If you've been to any Yard House before, then you know what to expect. Same thing, a little bit pricey, but overall a good experience. Cheers!",4
"Good food here and lots of beer to choose from. Be prepared to wait, as it's usually packed full, and it's going to be a little loud. But it's certainly worth a visit if you're around the LINC.",4
Really bad service be careful they changer more on bill,3
Such a good place. So much fun. Great wait staff.,5
"It was my first time at this location and we came just in time for happy hour. We ordered and shared poke nachos and ribeye with shrimp skewers. Everything was delicious and their drinks are strong! I tried a watermelon drink, can't remember the name of it but it was great. Our server checked on us a few times and he was very friendly.",5
We had a great time eating on the patio that sits in the Linq promenade,4
My food came out cold .Once I told the waitress she seem to have an attitude.  She stated let me get the manager.  She never got the manager but then came back and said I will bring you hot fries. Therefore while I am waiting for hot fries my burger is getting cold. I asked for the manager that was in duty. I expressed my concerns to him but he said ok . I decided  to remove the food from my order. Five minutes  after he took it away he came back and ask did I want to order something else. My waitress  came back 10 minutes  later and ask were they remaking my order. I told her no. The food seem to be ok being so I couldn't enjoy it .,2
"Happy hour!!! Carnivore pizza, calamari,  and 2 beers for $30. Hurry up!",5
Excellent selection of beers,5
Very different food and we ate on a sofa. Loved it. We return when back in Vegas. Best burgers!!,5
"Happy hour appetizers we're great! Service very good... Friendly, casual atmosphere. Food quality and quantity we're very good!",5
Man do I love me some Yard House. It is literally the greatest place ever. The Happy Hour during the week cannot be beaten. My favorite is the Moo Shoo Eggrolls for $5. So good. The calamari is great also. This one is right on the Strip and in a great area (The Promenade). If Albuquerque ever gets one of these I might be in trouble....,5
Good place for a beer. Service is okay for such a busy place. Good greasy but I like it!,4
Went for the lunch special which runs from 11 to 5. A good deal for a decent amount of food. The roast beef dip could have been on a weck roll though. Otherwise decent.,4
Not worth the time. Drinks are served in dirty glassware and when told about it you are actually told to leave because the don’t wash things well.,1
"Amazing beer selection, great looking food, and decent prices for being in Vegas! Great service as well!",5
Very good happy hour. Seems like a fun place to visit when social distancing is over.,4
"Burned burger, watched three parties sit after us, order after us and received their food before us. Worst experience at a yard house ever. I always go to yard house in carlsbad ca and have a great experience. Beware don’t go here.",1
"Food was not good at all!!!! Vodka Shrimp Pasta tasted like Spaghetti-O’s out of the can, no seasoning, poor service!!! With the Spicy Jambalaya I tasted more tomato sauce than anything the shrimp were good, but that’s all I ate out of my dish were the shrimps. Nice atmosphere but horrible food! 😡",1
"Love the customer service ! Good food !
I really like the ambiance and how the server treats the customer . I will keep coming back !",4
Great Atmosphere,5
This place has amazing food and drinks. We were blown away by the staff and their knowledge of the menu.,5
"Came here for a quick bite before checkout, food wasn't as good this year as it was last year, the service was still on par but our food came out wrong and we didn't have time to wait for it to be corrected. Hopefully next year it will be back to how I remember it!",3
Used to be my favorite restaurant.  Very fond memories 2016-2018 at this place. Menu changed a bit still great service though.,4
The food and staff were great and any kind of beer you can think of.,5
I love the food and the employee was awesome,5
"Nice comfortable atmosphere away from the outside. Not too quiet, not too loud. Good drinks, and great guacamole and chips. Stopped in here for a snack and some drinks.",4
"I went here for my birthday, it was just something to relax have some good food and drinks. The waiter saw that it was my birthday thru my ID he congratulated me. Gave great service and at the end of the night he brought a birthday dessert which is the nicest and coolest thing any waiter has done. Best beer selection I ever seen and great bar food. The ribs with cream corn and beans are definitely the BEST.",5
Consistently good. The only reason I gave it 4 star is it's like all the other locations so rather had something more unique to Vegas,4
Lovely atmosphere. Nice food drink. Friendly staff.,5
Tasty food,5
Awesome beer selection and reasonable prices for the location!  Highly recommend.,5
The Yard House has a great vegetarian selection featuring Gardein meat substitute menu items! I had the Gardein BBQ Chicken Pizza and it was delicious! I highly recommend eating at the Yard House. The Las Vegas Strip location had great service with a friendly staff! Just keep heading towards the Ferris wheel. Enjoy!,5
"Love this place. Good food, good drinks, good service, everytime!",5
Very lively place. A bit loud but you don't go here for peace and quiet. It is located near the giant ferris wheel structure and is part of an outdoor promenade with many good shops and restaurants. The food options are varied. We went with a large group and ordered several items to share. We enjoyed all of them. Beer selection is good and the prices were reasonable. Service was a little slow but it was peak time and we had a large group so it wasn't terrible.,4
"Great waiter, good food selection.",5
"Good food, service, drinks, & atmosphere",5
Awesome beer selection. The steak power salad is amazing!!,5
"Good food and drinks. A little pricey, but everything on the strip is pricey. Had an amazing pineapple mojito there.",4
Staff and manager were awesome had a small issue with a meal that was fixed within minutes and they couldn't have being more apologetic. Food was really good and we have already planned on going back,5
My son absolutely  loved  the spicy chicken sandwich and fries I brought to him,4
"Great place to eat. Has great menu, chicken kale Cesar salad to die for.
Wonder service. Can’t wait to go back.",5
"Food is good, atmosphere is nice. Service was ok.",3
Very good food,4
"Ginger crested salmon is out of this world!!!  We have eaten there 3 times in 4 days.  Nakiah, Jason and Patrick were fabulous servers/ bartenders.  Highly recommend!!!",5
My favorite place in Vegas. The beer selection was so good I just didn't want to leave. The food is great and the staff is very friendly. I was very impressed with how knowledgeable the people behind the bar are about the beers they have available.,5
"Nice food and great prices, especially since restaurants in the area are mainly super fancy ones.

They are really good with allergies and they worked with me (two days in a row) to find a dish that suited me, and the kitchen knows what to do with cleaning everything and not contaminating stuff. The angel hair pasta is good for dairy free people like me (minus the cheese).

Best restaurant I could find in the area and I went there twice! Do go, especially if you have allergies!",5
"The Yard House is a fun restaurant to visit. They have some of the best Gumbo that you can find. They also have a few good burgers. Good food, lots of drinks, fun place.",5
I highly recommend the fried fish!!!!!😍😍😍 So delicious!!!  That's what I ate!😃,5
All good. Went during happy hour. My only complaint. They were out of the cider I wanted. Made up for it by giving the birthday boy in our group a killer broulee cheesecake.,5
Great food and service. Restaurant was a little dusty from being empty and not properly reopened.,4
I love Yard House anywhere I go! I always recommend friends to go there and there is such a good atmosphere its great. The service is great and the people are lovely! Definitely recommend!,5
"Torn about my feelings about the Yard House. We ate there twice. Both times the waiters were a bit distant. It's a busy place, they see a lot of people, and probably pay more attention to the larger tables with larger tabs. I get it but kinda puts you off when feel like you're ignored or a second rate customer.

But if you put this behind you and just don't care about the staff, you'll love this place. Great food, SO many beer choices, and at reasonable prices.",5
Open late,4
Great dinner...love the Poke Natchos!,5
The food at Yard House is amazing! With many vegan options available. In a pinch Yard House is the best option to find vegan food.,4
"Awesome everything! Good prices, great food, phenomenal staff. Our server Stephen was 100% on point with the service and recommendations, he really made the entire experience.",5
Always great food and service,5
Food was nice- they tried to add something to our bill that we didn't have.,3
Love their beer selection & food awesome too!  Always stop here at least once when I'm in town....,5
Service was very nice. Drinks were awesome. The food was so-so tho. The tuna in my pokebowl was hard to chew and the ribeye steak was also chewy.,3
Thanks to Matt for making our pre-wedding dinner a great one. We'll be back!,5
"Great people, perfect location, and service was phenomenal! 🥰",5
"The barbeque chicken salad was the best I have ever had. The food is very well priced for the portion size, and for it being Las Vegas. The order came out quickly, and all the servers were very friendly. Additionally, the atmosphere here is very nice.",5
This is the place. Especially for happy hour. They have something for everyone. Great for kids.,5
Okay food,3
Great grub.,5
Exceptional food awesome happy hour specials,5
"Food taste and customer service impressed me. This restaurant has tasty snacks and so many American foods. Some dishes are really delicious including fSpicy Tuna Roll, Lobster Garlic Noodles, Onion Ring Tower, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Seared Ahi Sashimi, etc.",5
Great bar. Good food and lots of it. Drinks menu is very extensive. Well worth a visit,5
We had the angel hair pasta and a chicken pasta ..the angel hair one the eggplant was all seeds and dry ..the chicken penne one was dry as well and not much flavor. The spicy tuna roll was far from a roll but that was decent but not at all like a traditional roll. Our waiter was great he was very nice and helpful and on point. But sadly won't be coming back,3
1 of my favorite places to eat when I visit Las Vegas.,5
Omg! The 12oz. Sirloin & loaded potatoe stack with truffle fries...... the best ever. Coming back be for I go home that's for sure.,5
Great food and service! The servers were very friendly. Come here for happy hour (Mon-Fri 3-6) for great deals on food and drinks.,5
"Amazing food (I’ve had jambalaya, chicken sandwich, sliders and nachos). An abundant selection of drafts on tap. Fast, efficient customer service.",5
Slow services orders took 45 minutes to come out. The restaurant wasn't that busy. I watched 3 parties that came in after us receive their food first. Half of our party ate and was leaving.,1
It was my 40th birthday and my wife and just got off the high roller. We chose yard house because it was close by. It was a great place to eat. They had over a hundred different types of beer.,5
"Cool place, good food. Nice place to watch football games at",5
Food was so amazing! Portions were large. Can't wait to go back!,5
"Really nice place, great food, priced very well and has exceptional and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend",5
"Great selection of beer, fast service, and good food.  It's a chain restaurant, but it still has character.  They had a good selection of local beers and the bartender knew what they were talking about.",5
VERY YUMMY! Drinks and food A+ service was amazing.   Would go back again when in Vegas.  Went twice while we were in town for lunch.,5
Nice yard house. Great customer service ;-) thank you Zack,5
My husband and I dined here for lunch during our stay in Vegas. The reviews and ratings made it an obvious place to try. My husband got the pork belly ramen and loved the flavors. He especially loved the richness of the broth. The pork was very tender and it was a decadent ramen. I got the pork belly buns and loved them. The buns are so fluffy and soft that they are like clouds. The pork belly along with the cucumbers and hoisin sauce made it a tasty combination. I loved that there were other options other than ramen and small plates available for those wanting a smaller plate. I would surely eat here again- super tasty!,3
Amazing selection of craft beer and an outstanding vegan/plant-based menu,5
Great beer.... Excellent price at Happy Hour Monday through Friday 3p-6p,5
"The restaurant was up to par, but what motivated me to write this review was the fantastic service we received from our waitress.  We went to Yard House for lunch and were seated after a short wait.  Our waitress quickly took and fulfilled our drink orders, described menu items, and offered add-ons while mentioning their price.  What impressed me was her service and attention to detail while we ate.  She filled our water glasses frequently, off the table, and purposefully did not touch the pitcher to our glasses or our straws.  She brought condiments and cleared straw wrappers from our table prior to our food's arrival.  Our food was served promptly.  These details may seem trivial, but it is relieving when you know the staff is well-trained and detail-oriented.  Overall, the restaurant was clean, the food was good (as it always is at Yard House), and the service was outstanding.",4
Poke nachos are Fire!,5
AMAZING FOOD. Every time I'm in Vegas I come here for the Vodka Shrimp Pasta and to try out some not so traditional ciders. Amazing service and atmosphere. Yard House is really doing things right.,5
"Delicious VEGAN food, wonderful staff!! Will definitely recommend",5
"I love the yard house♥️ the food, the atmosphere, all of it and I love it no matter what city I'm in!",5
Love this place. Great service. Cold beer and food is always consistently good.,5
"My husband and I went here based on reviews. We arrived early (around 6:30) and were seated quickly. The hostess pointed out the bathroom on the way to our table which I appreciated. We had DJ take our drink order and recommend several tasty things. And then... We waited. I didn't notice at first because we sat on the covered patio and were doing some great people watching, but after a while I noticed because I was starving... so, that is when I decided I would write a review. Everyone was so friendly, but the wait time for the food was killing me.

I don't know what Yard House's ""oh crap"" time was, but once it was hit, DJ came out to apologize and check on us a couple of times, explained there were several large parties and the kitchen got swamped. There was a shift change, so we then got Jessica who also apologized and one more person popped over to check on us. Shortly after, our food arrived - which was quite tasty! (Get the garlic fries... seriously!) After 10 more minutes, the manager came over to check on our meal, also apologized and took care of dinner for us - which we didn't expect. I appreciated that we didn't throw a tantrum or create a scene and that Yard House did the right thing to ensure that they could ""rewrite"" how we felt about our experience. (They had no idea I was going to write a review.)

So, the summary is:
1. The food is tasty (must haves: garlic fries and s'mores brownie)
2. The staff is super friendly and cheerful
3. They did all that they could to make our experience a good one
4. As a bonus, they aren't that expensive for Vegas and the people watching is pretty good ""outside""  :)",5
"So many beers to choose from! Our party of 8 got to sit together, and my keto-friendly burger was delicious. I ordered a six-pack beer sampler, and it was so fun to try all those exotic flavors!",5
"Nice atmosphere, friendly bartenders.  Drinks could have been a little stronger.",4
Great food. Service is amazing. In my opinion these are only two things one needs to have a good time.,5
"James was a fantastic waiter and all of our food came out promptly, delicious drinks and food as well. We went when it was calm and a had a very pleasant experience!",5
"Love love love yard house.   Even in Vegas which has brilliant restaurants, the Yardhouse shines. Always top notch Food and drinks .  Never been let down with service either.",5
"My husband and I stopped by Yard House for lunch when we arrived in Vegas. If you're around the area during Happy Hour (M-F starting at 3pm) it's an especially good deal. The food was very good and their selling point is the huge selection of beers. The waiter we had was awesome, very friendly and on it.",5
Just ok,3
"got in quickly, great food and service",5
Best food ever  if you go there you will not be disappointed  make sure you ask for Brittany,5
We had such a great time here. The GM was great to talk to Jay was on it for sure. Great conversations and helped talk though all beer questions!,5
Excellent food and great prices. Would definitely recommend.,5
"Good beer, great food, cheap Johnnie Walker Black Label. The Poke Nachos are fantastic. Not bad for a break from all the lights and sounds of Vegas, but it is a fairly loud place (you're still in Vegas after all).",5
"Always love going there. Great beer and good food!
Kid friendly as well",5
"Excellent find on the Las Vegas strip! Relatively quiet adult-oriented restaurant and atmosphere, reasonable prices, I'll be coming back here at least once a trip",5
The food and service was incredible!!! Ask for Lindsay,5
"Service was amazing. Food was ok, some of our chicken was overcooked.",4
"Impressive beer list. Friendly, helpful staff.  Good atmosphere.  A little out of the way to people watch, but quiet place to recharge.",5
"The burgers there are delicious. It's like a pub, so a bit loud inside, but the food is really worth it. Recommend the truffle cheeseburger.",5
It was amazing for beer lovers and serve good food as well. I could not even count how many types and name brand of beers they have.,4
Super delicious I loved everything I ordered. Lots and lots of different beers like 125+ Just a bit too expensive.  Wish I was able to try more beers.,4
Excellent food. Fabulous environment. Hoping there is one back home in Dallas!,5
Best onion rings I've ever had.  Got the left hand nitro milk stout and it was smooth and fantastic.  So many tap beers to choose from.  Definitely go during happy hour of you can!,5
Food was good service was good just a bit loud and overfiled,5
"Great food and service, prices were on par with the other restaurants in the area",5
The food and service was excellent.  Great selection of items to eat and drink. And relatively reasonable on price for its location.  I expected to pay more than I did so that's a huge bonus as Vegas is an expensive place.,4
Food and drinks was really good,4
Drinks great food not as good as the drinks but its vegas right?,5
Beer selection is great. I would not come for the food or atmosphere though. Had chicken nachos and we could not find one shred of chicken in it. Also BBQ chicken salad had two tiny morsels of chicken. The people beside us were so loud it was hard to hear each other.,3
Awesome selection of beer and food. Great place to kill some time over some beer.,4
"Lots of vegetarian options, cool collection of beers. I would not call it amazing food but better than most joints.",4
Good food and service. Great beer options large selection,4
"We want to give a huge shout out to the waiter Alec- my boyfriend and I loved him! I am not the easiest person to take out due to dietary restrictions and Alec was very kind and real. He made our time at Yard House awesome. Also, the food was DELICIOUS!",5
So many choices,4
Service was a little slow food was good 👍🏻. Would come back again,4
Andrew is amazing! The best server ever!! Fried mac & cheese is to die for. Ahi app is amazing.,5
"Been to vegas twice, we came here to eat both visits, I'm am not personally a beer drinker but if you are this is the place to be, so many different flavors,  my niece had a pineapple flavored beer and I tried it, definitely tasted like pineapple! The food is just as good and big portions!!",5
"Many many beer options, very well and cold served. Nice burgers and several options of plates. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, clean restrooms.",5
Decent food! Food is better when it isn't crazy busy! Better to go when not insanely busy. They cant handle the volume!,4
Very impressive spot with a great beer menu and a vast food menu. This is the place to go when you have a great that can't decide what kind of food to get because they have a bit of everything!,4
Great food! Amazing atmosphere! The gluten free options were amazimg!,5
Huge beer selection! One of the only places on the strip where I can enjoy a draft Longboard. Get the Vampire Tacos!,4
Amazing food great customer service,5
"My bride to be and I had our sights on a different (even more casual) venue for our wedding rehearsal last week, but then the place shut-down! Thankfully, Yard House at The LINQ saved the day by taking our reservation of 18 last minute!

The food was impeccable - something agreed by each and every one of our guests. Both non-vegan and vegan guests, alike! Focusing on the vegan burger and vegan wings: BOTH WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD awesome!

Service was great too. We couldn't have asked for a better spot for our special day.",5
Food was fantastic,5
Average food. Fantastic waiter,3
Best place I've ever ate at...the wife liked it as welll...5 stars,5
Great food and customer service,5
Friendly staff and great food!!,5
Great food and service,5
Very good food. Nice size portions. I would definitely recommend it,5
Simply EXCELLENT.,5
Waiter very friendly. Good prices,5
"American food, not great, a little bit touristy - I had the Nashville hot chicken and it wasn't very hot, was even a bit sweet - but not a bad place in Vegas to get burgers and beers.",3
3 words....vampire street tacos!!! Absolutely delicious. Great food and great service. The only thing they couldnt do was make the chiefs beat the patriots. I expect that on the menu next time im there!,5
"slow service..queso dip isnt a dip at all just meltd hunk of cheese.spindip sux too.kinda pricy for small pints  no sun on ""patio"". hostess was wicked rude. lots taps half empty tho.lots barstaff yet lack of service",2
The chicken and waffles are amazing. This was also the best mac and cheese I've ever had. Service was excellent,5
"While I typically love coming out for great beers and good food, I unfortunately won't be back. My sister and I experienced some serious food poisoning after visiting this location in February. We believe it was from the Korean beef since that's the food item we had in common. We planned on having a fun filled night, but instead I couldn't even back it back to the parking garage without spending about 30 minutes in the restroom. I spent the next three days on a toilet drinking pedialyte instead of enjoying the city. I have never been so ill. We contacted management and they listened to our concerns, but I never want to experience that again.",1
Always a great selection of beer on tap. Love this place. Wish there were more of them.,5
the staff was very welcoming and observant. prices that won't break you. feels like a place in charlotte that i enjoyed visiting.,4
"This place was really very good. Easy to see why there was a few minutes wait, when we had turned up on spec - it's busy because it's so good. Great service, great food, great beer, great value for money.",5
"If I could give 0 stars I would. Ordered chicken nachos, food was horrible.",1
"Our favorite place, great food, amazing list of craft beers and friendly knowledgeable staff. As a local, very disappointed the Linq no longer has free parking for locals. Probably won't be going downtown anymore as I'm not paying $10.00 for an hour of parking to have lunch. Bummed.",5
"My favorite place in Vegas, I tried the yard house in San Jose, I like Vegas one much better",5
"Possibly the best place to get some food and a good beer in this city that for some reason doesn't like to embrace good beer. Compared with the restaurants in the casinos where at best there is one or two craft options, there are several dozen here. The tap list reads like a novel. There are some excellent finds here with styles to suit any taste. The food is pretty good as well. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich was delicious with a perfect balance of spice, tanginess, and sweetness. Service was very friendly and quick as well. It's a great place to come and enjoy a bunch of good beer and some snacks at the awesome and huge bar while watching a game.",5
"Whatever you do, get the Poke Nachos first. If you get them from 3-6pm, they're half price. Regardless, they are an excellent fusion of sushi and nachos.",5
Tasty food & Super Service by our server Matt!,5
Good food reasonable prices nice atmosphere right on the Link,5
"Excellent food, hamburger and pizza for us, excellent and friendly staff.  Food within ten minutes of ordering. Sat on elevated deck outside as the sun went down.  Great view of the new High Roller. Very reasonable prices considering they were in the Linq and on the strip. Plenty of food, left full. Well certainly eat here again on a future trip.",4
"After enjoying the happy hour on the High Roller we decided to go over to Yard House for a late dinner. Unfortunately they wouldn’t let us bring in outside drinks, which we thought was silly since the drink was from an attraction right next door. It was late so there wasn’t much of a wait anyway to sit so we strolled the strip at the LINQ (which is awesome by the way) while we finished our drinks. We ended up sitting on the outside patio which was great for people watching. The lobster, crab, artichoke dip and the fried calamari were delicious. My fiancé had the Atlantic salmon and I had 2 hard shell tacos. We couldn’t order dessert because we were so full! The food was great, as was the service. Definitely a meal we won’t forget.",5
"Really enjoyed the Asian style appetizers here, and they have an extensive beer selection; I would've preferred more IPAs to choose from, but I enjoyed the one I had. The bartender was very friendly.",5
Great selection of beers.  Good service and food is tasty.,4
"Outstanding beer selection, knowledgeable bartenders and good food. Decor and atmoshpere are very welcoming. A great place to stop when walking up and down the strip.",5
Best beer selection on the strip (including delights like Sours) and some local beers. Touted as 120 taps.  Busy but nice bar staff (particularly Summer).,5
"From our experience, this is the most enjoyable restaurant in Vegas. The experience is relaxed and the food is amazing! The chicken nachos, mo shoo egg rolls, and pepperoni pizza are all items I've ordered before and I recommend each highly.",5
"If you like beer, 180 taps and knowledgeable staff. Nuff said. For me, beer is like Pokemon - gotta try em all. The only food I've had here are the truffle fries (freaking delicious), the crispy Brussels sprouts and potatoes (also wonderful), and some tacos. The Korean pork belly taco was amazing but the vampire taco was a bit too hot. I'm not taking a star off for that, because everything else is spot on and one man's ""too spicy"" is another man's ""just right"". Seriously, come try this place.",5
Loved every dish. Staff is great and quite enough to talk. I'll be going back next time I'm in town. The desserts are great. The brownie cooked to order is a winner.,5
"Best steaks ever, great atmosphere, prompt and friendly service.  Reasonable prices too.",5
Pablo offered amazing service. Wasn't my type of food. American and European mashups. Creative but not quite refined. Had the short rib ravioli with cream sauce with sun-dried tomatoes. Meh.,4
"Crazy busy loud place, but a lot of fun! Food and drinks were good. They also have a separate gluten free menu and we're super careful and checked on each item rven though it was busy.",4
Service was great and we where brought our food pretty quick once we ordered.,5
Came here for lunch and loved it!! Everything we ordered was so delicious! The tortilla soup was to die for! We will definitely  be back.,5
"Always a great place to have dinner and enjoy a beer or two. Staff was amazing, wait time was surprisingly a short one.",5
Great place for a yard of beer and awesome food.,5
Delicious food great drinks,5
Food was good but I recall the spicy rice being a little better and huge disappointment is the lack of mahi mahi dish they used to have. A bit slow to get a table but the wait staff was very attentive.,4
"It's alright. I'm not from the area, or a City that's so tightly packed. Parking was frustrating but it was awesome that they do validate at three different garages nearby. Food was average. I was excited to try a truffle Burger, but was underwhelmed by it. (Maybe too much hype around it) wait staff was awesome, and if there weren't so many options that I haven't tried yet I would definitely come here again.
#safebet",4
I am giving 5 stars for the sake of the Brew choices at this YH. It is simply amazing. The food isn't bad either. There are enough choices here that will satisfy anyone.,5
"The Yardhouse is always a reliable bar, great selection of beers and a fine range of food to go with it. The bar staff are always welcoming and friendly.",5
Lots of beer choice and great food,5
One of the best meals I've ever had! Ask for a side of the truffle dip with your food you'll love it! And the smores brownie is awesome!,5
Nice location and good food. Good service. The vegetarian dishes (gardein) were excellent,4
"For us as a family, this is the best place in Vegas.  In th Linq area just beyond the high roller observation wheel.  Drinks are average price, food above average quality but still an affordable option to other venues on the strip.  Boneless chicken wings, possibly the only reason i go back to Vegas, with the firecracker sauce.  Wish i were there now.
Check it out, you will not regret it.",5
BBQ chicken salad was excellent and so was the vampire taco!  Beer selection is unmatched,5
We are locals celebrating my other better half for his birthday ... wanted something fast & delicious at the same time ... perfect!  Plus Andrew was our waiter ... he was patient & awesome!,5
"Nice food, good service and of course a huge selection of draft Beer.",5
"Went to this restaurant while in Vegas for a wedding, have to say it was the best meal we have had while here! The waiter was great as well. I had the enchilada stack and my wife had pineapple chicken - simply gorgeous 😀",4
I love yard house. There food is good and the service is to.,5
"Horrible host service. Bad communication, didn't even check how long a wait was supposed to be for my group. Just gave a beeper then told us to wait. There were about 5 people just talking to each other without giving us updates. Let's hope the servers don't suck as bad.",1
"We have a YardHouse in phoenix although I have never been, after this experience I will be trying our Yardhouse. I ordered the black truffle burger and it was amazing very tasty and filling. They also have a wide range of vegan options and 100s of beers to chose from. Our waiter was very sarcastic in a good way and made our experience very enjoyable.",5
"Great atmosphere, diverse menu with lots of small plates and apps for sharing, tons of beers and other beverages. I always enjoy coming here :)",5
I found this place accidentally when walking through the LINQ promenade and decided to walk in after having a look at the menu outside. Service was really nice and quick. The variety of beer was astounding and the food was delicious. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options as well!,5
"Great place, food was good  service was okay..nice place.",4
"MUST try the lamb burger yum yum yum .. ask they to make it well done. And they had my favorite beer Hoegaarden.
Good options for Vegetarians who like fake meat - buffalo chicken wings , chicken tenders . The Brussel sprouts potato was yum as well
Would love to go back for the lamb burger",5
Fantastic beer selection.,5
Fantastic food and beers. Really well priced and did I mention the 200 different types of beer.. Lol,5
Good food half price appts during happy hour.,5
Great happy hour prices on appetizers and very good tasting food. Beer prices are high in my opinion. Bartenders were well informed on the menu and they were attentive.,4
This was our first meal in Vegas and it was delicious. We had drinks and appetizers at the bar. We had the poke nachos and they were sooo good also the Korean wings were delicious a little spicy but very good .. the bar tender was very knowledgeable of the extensive beer selection ..wish I remember his name ..,5
Food was just okay hence not worth the price. They didn't cook the gardein chicken properly so the consistency wasn't right. The service was very friendly.,3
First server couldn't get a water order right but thankfully the second was way better. Had the Beef Dip sandwich which was good but it was so juicy the bottom but was very soggy. Might want to toast the bread or let the beef drip off before putting it on the bun.,4
"Wonderful place.... Loved our waiter but had to leave and our waitress was just as nice....both gave us excellent service.... we had the lamb burgers and they were delicious, along the 1/2 yard beer!!  Would go back when in Vegas!",5
Really good service and nice size portions,5
"Fun, great beer selection and good service.",4
Great food and excellent service!,5
They have a ton of popular beers from around the country with a few local crafts thrown in. The food is fantastic with a lot of variety. Highly recommended if you want to take a break from the $$$$ restaurants.,5
"Good food, kind of an upscale sports bar. Quite busy when we were there, so we had about a 20 minute wait. Friendly staff, and it was clean and spacious. For some reason the gal who seated us (and everyone else) was very particular to point out the location of the restroom...",4
The beer selection is amazing and the staff are very knowledgeable and super friendly. Would recommend highly.,5
"Love it here, great selection of draft beer, 180 taps I believe. Good bar food and plenty of screens for watching sport.",5
Great people and a great atmosphere. I would definitely suggest this restaurant.,5
Great food and beer!  Robert was our waiter and so friendly and helpful on our selections!  Highly recommend!!,5
Great place. Going back every time I am in Las Vegas.,5
The food and drinks were average and pricey. Atmosphere was nice and restrooms were clean,3
Service was terrible and we were alone in the restaurant. We had to get up to get our beers and drinks.,2
Service great and food excellent!!!! Will definitely come back Yardhouse here in Vegas!!,5
OMG FOOD WAS AMAZING,5
Always a favorite while in Vegas.. Just like home good food and great c service,5
"Wonderful experience, great food, excellent service and very quaint environment. Would recommend.",5
"Good food, good variety, very friendly staff",4
"Good food, good service, decent prices.  Only 4 stars because there are too many distracting TV screens",4
Best kale salad I ever had. Service was exceptional.,5
Love this place my favorite is the Tuna roll. Service is always great and the food never disappoints,5
"You like beer? You've got TONS of options for beer here, like over 100+. Their menu needs a litle work if you're a beer connosuer though. If you like to know the alchohol percentage, you're in good hands. The trouble for me was they don't include the verious beer's IBU rating, so you don't have a good grasp of how bitter, and/or ""hoppy"" the beer is. They do give you some insights on the menu, however, breaking down the large assortment of beer options by type, including, ""Wheat, Fruit/Sour, Malty/Amber, IPA/Hoppy, Strong/Dark, Light, Crisp/Refreshing, Brown/Stout, Strong/Golden, Bottles/Cans, Cider, and Seasonal/Rotating.",5
"Lots and lots of beer to choose from. Food was also really good, the nachos were a great starter to share and the pizzas were well done. Drinking from the yard glasses is mostly just awkward and I would stick to other sizes. Staff was helpful and seemed to all really know their beer.",4
"Good beer, friendly staff. Not much could go wrong here.",5
Great food & location! Awesome beer list,5
"Wow, the team that greated us, served us, and gave us our check couldn't care less. I didn't even have a chance to tell our waiter that the food was grossly overcooked and was like chewing on a rock with limp, cold fries to accompany it.  I've eaten here several times, this will be my last. It might be time to focus on better CX guys.

- Disappointed",2
Great food and excellent service. Recommended.,5
Amazing service and Food!,5
Great variety on Happy Hour. The portions were HUGE! The chicken tender and sliders appetizer plates both included fries... Definitely a return visit!,5
We had a great meal here with family. From the atmosphere to the service to the food. No complaints.,5
On the Linq promenade closer to the High Roller. Pretty big place with a large selection of beer. Burger was ok. There is better food other places. Server was nice. Would be a good place to grab a few beers.,3
"Tried the Korean tacos, they were good, bit the rice and beans left a lot to be desired. Would possibly go back to try something different, but I don't know that it's likely...",3
The food was delicious but you may have to wait a bit for it to arrive. The restaurant appeared to be unprepared for a busy Friday night. Good food though. I just wished it didn't arrive cooled.,3
Great selection of food and drinks!! Good if you don't know what you want to eat!,5
Great selection of drafts of all kinds. The food was excellent and they had a very kind and fun staff.,5
"The Nachos are delicious, great for sharing with two people as a dish or up to four as an apetizer. The cheesecake brulee is a must eat! You won't be disappointed!",4
I have never met a Yard House dish I didn't like.  I usually can't stay away from the Cuban sandwich but venture out to try other options.  I have been to a Yard House in five states and have never been disappointed by food or service.,5
"Great place, great service, excellent food, lots of vegetarian options and helpful advice and consideration around that, great drinks 👍👍👍",5
"This has become my goto spot in Vegas to eat.  I didn't realize it was a chain and you certainly wouldn't know it by the food quality.

I mostly get the angel hair pasta and it is absurdly good with tons of ingredients added.  Adding meat isn't even necessary it is so good.  The angel hair pasta at Yard House definitely blows away the angel hair pasta you can order at allegro which is a high end Italian restaurant at The Wynn.

Truffle fries are also very good.  Also like the hummus albeit the pita bread is a bit hit or miss.  The tacos aren't that great but I have high standards for Mexican food.

Downstairs can be a bit loud and has more of a bar feel.  I had no clue but there is a gigantic upstairs where you can see into the kitchen. Upstairs is quieter and has more of a restaurant feel.  Also this place has outdoor seating but I haven't eaten out there (deck looks kool).

Anyways, I'll keep returning here over and over!",4
When me and my friend arrived from the time Chyana asked us to wait til the time she sat us OMG AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE  she even told us where the restroom was and a lot of hostess don’t do that. She was really pleasant.Then Adrian our waiter was great as well he made sure we didn’t need anything and our food was amazing.I also spoke with the Manager  Wed August 28th   and told him  the whole place was great. Thanks for a great experience.,5
Their vegan and vegetarian Gardien options are why we ate there. Keep it up!,5
"First time dining at a Yardhouse restaurant.... We definitely will return! Appetizers: calamari, lumpia, and chicken wings (no breading, fried and sauced). Entree: rib eye steak with shrimp.... Wow!
Steak had garlic butter melted on top with skewered jumbo shrimp, paired with spinach garlic mashed potatoes and choice of veggies.
Steak was very just and tender. Excellent flavor.",5
we had to ask a few times for stuff we ordered.,3
Came here for a lunch special. There were all kinds of extra charges and then the food was just not good. The service was good though.,2
The food was excellent little high priced but the food was extremely delicious,5
"Awesome food,pricey ,but worth it.",4
"Loved this place, great service and amazing food! Just delicious!!!",5
Food was good. The service was excellent,5
Ate here several times while on vacation.  The food & service is wonderful! Really like the menu options. Price is super reasonable,5
"Cool atmosphere, good service and food, ok drinks plenty of large booths and high top seating too.",4
Excellent food and service!,5
"Not to expensive, and the food was good.",5
Fantastic selection for Celiacs. Blackened shrimp tacos are fabulous.,5
Went on a Friday evening . Not very busy for a change so service was quick and on point. Ordered seared tuna salad with dressing on side. The veggies we're fresh but the tuna a bit too cooked to my liking. Crispy wontons we're a bit soggy but the whole experience generally was good. Our waitress wAs very attentive. The other times I went the place was busy with slow service so plan accordingly,3
"Great food and service, and generally a good place to hang out, be prepared to wait a little while as very popular. Can get a drink whole you wait for your buzzer to go off!",5
"Lots of beers on tap. Sadly, today they were out of Gulden Draak. Plenty of other tasty beers available.",5
"Solid place or some delicious food. Nothing off the hook but won't go away hungry or disappointed. American fare. Big, open atmosphere.",4
Helen is an absolute angel! Thanks for seating us!,5
It was gross to me but smelled good from outside. I have been to the Florida location and it was awesome,1
"My rice was hard and beans were cold, but the tacos were good and our server was very fast. My friends truffle fries, that she paid extra for, were cold. Cant really reccomend it.",3
Nice food,4
"Slow service, food was ok. Not much going on while we stopped in for a bit. Won't go out of my way for stopping here.",2
"Outstanding in food and service!  Ordered a Spicy Jambalaya and a Cuban sandwich.  Their version of the Louisiana Jambalaya is phenomenal!  Take it from me, LSU alumni  Class 1993.  Outside the campus gates at LSU, you can enjoy great Louisiana Jambalaya at The Chimes bar & grill.  But on this side of the Mississippi river,  Yardhouse is the place!
Ah, yeah, the Cubano...became a midnight snack.  With all due respect to my Cuban friends.   Couldn't put down the fork until the last Jambalaya shrimp was gone!  Will let you know on the Cubano later...",5
"One of my favorite places.  Awesome food, awesome drinks.  Great staff",5
Great place! All went perfect! Need to find one near Dayton Ohio!,5
The food and service is great.,5
"The Poke Nachos, BBQ chicken salad, and the brussels sprouts. Get them all. You won't regret it.",5
We had another great experience at yard house   First time at this location and it was great,5
"Really good food and a very nice, cozy atmosphere. The wait staff was very pleasant. It's a really nice restaurant, highly recommended!",5
"Excellent bar food, huge selection of beer, and staff can make great suggestions for paring the beer with the food",5
Entertaining waiter. Good food and drink!,4
"Great beer list, had just dessert and drinks. Their service was great, our waiter attentive and knowledgeable. Located just steps off the strip.",5
"Great food, great beer, well located. A bit too noisy, but hey, what isn't in Vegas?",5
Delicious,5
No shortage of variety here. Chill and fun atmosphere.,4
Unfortunately I ordered the roast beef dip which looked great on the outside but the beef was cut too thick for a sandwich and was tough. Also a lot of fat and grizzle was left on it which did not make it enjoyable.,3
"Copious beer selection, books good, fine service",4
"My boneless wings were room temperature, and overcooked. They effectively went from too hot, to too cold.

Clam chowder was pretty good though. Thanks Sysco!",1
Only reason to go is for the reasonably priced food with good proportion sizes. The few times we went I was happy with each entree,5
Went during Happy Hour and they had great prices on lots of choices. Service and atmosphere were great too.,5
Great company and amazing service. Rib eye was cooked to perfection,5
Steak was great.,5
"Our Lyft driver said The Yard House was a reasonably priced place with good food so we decided to try it for lunch. It took 30 minutes to get our order placed after she brought us waters/drinks. After we placed our order, it took another 30 minutes to get our food. Overall when the food arrived it was all just ok but I don't think it was worth the prices and the long wait times. It was not that crowded and there appeared to be enough staff.",3
"This place has, supposedly, a wide selection of beers. Well, maybe not.
Me: ""I will have the Elysian Dayglow IPA""
Server: ""sure""
Server, 3 minutes later: ""Sorry, we're out"".
Me: "" I will have the Hop Valley Citrus Mistress""
Server: ""Right away!""
Server, 3 minutes later: ""So sorry, we are also out of that one"".
You know what? Screw you, don't pretend you have a wide selection of beers if you cannot actually serve it. Cut your beer menu in half and make sure you have everything on there.
I will not talk about the food, everybody knows it is very just okay.",2
Great relaxing spot close to the strip. Service and food was excellent!,5
"Really cool venue, on the really cool LINQ and fun music to boot.",5
"Great location right by the Linq.. HUGE menu with something for everyone, whether you're vegetarian, vegan or gluten free. Food was really good, as was the michelada. Sat in the faux outdoor patio.... outside, but with covering and some air. Cool even though it was 110 outside.",5
Service was great and food was delicious. Clean establishment with a good beverage selection as well,5
"It's the Yard House, how could you go wrong? Seriously, if you've never been to one then go. Huge beer selection which is often served in half yard glasses if you desire. Great meals too.",5
"I we t 3 days in a row. Really good food, nice people, and full bar.",5
Great food and service best burgers in town and best location,5
The food was okay.  Didn't love it. I thought it was going to be a different vibe but was wrong.,3
Decently priced with a variety of different foods,4
Great food and service but really small portion.,4
Always good! The peach cobbler is absolutely incredible,5
"Good place to eat, we got 1/2 prices during lunch.  Great service.",4
"Briona gave us wonderful service. She was kind, meticulous, and swift. The bacon and egg Bloody Mary I had was awesome. My pork Cuban sandwich was legit.
Unfortunately one of the burgers at our table was quite undercooked, which is a simple mistake that happens. As one whose worked in service industry, I completely understand that as humans we’re flawed and mistakes can happen.
The silver lining: Tryone, I assume one of the managers, came to our table, apologized for the mistake, and took care of the cost of the food blemish. It was handled very professionally.

In the infamous words of Arnold Schwarzenegger - “I’ll be back.”",5
Great service even for being a large group and coming in at 11pm at night. The food is always good,5
great food.. tons of beer to choose from... quality service.. reasonable priced..,5
Great food amazing beers.  Staff are amazing,5
"We ate at the Yard House in Temecula, California and the food was outstanding. Ate at the one in Vegas and it was a total disappointment other than the Ahi Tuna Wontons.",2
Drank at the bar. Ate at a table - food was very good. Servers are awesome friendly people. So many beers - so little time!,5
"Vegan Burger: 10/10
Calamari: 9/10
Chicken Tenders: 8/10
Pepper crusted gorgonzola burger: 4/10

Sister had the Vegan Burger and said it was the best shes ever had! Both times we came, waiters were ALWAYS on the refills. I was never waiting on them to get me my diet coke. FANTASTIC SERVICE! 5 stars, A+. This was one of the only places this Vegas trip were I gave the fatty 35% tip. Too bad I didn't win my WSOP event because if I did, my waiter would have had a huge payday.",5
"Great service from our server!  Wide variety of foods; vegetarian and vegan as well.  Even being in Vegas, the price wasn't outrageous.",4
The ginger crusted salmon was incredible! Impressive beer selection. Highly recommend this place.,5
Love this chain restuarant. We had a server named Alex i believe.. great guy.,5
One of my favorite bars to hang out with a big group. We were a loud group who doesn’t sit well and the waitresses were great. My go to beer here is the tangerine wheat (Lost something). My favorite apps are the cheese curds (squeaky like the real ones) and the queso (put it on the tortillas).,5
"Food, is really good. Staff are very friendly and it's a fun place to go have dinner and a drink.",5
The food amazing!! Customer service amazing!,5
To expensive food wasn't so good but service was friendly,3
Love love love the Yard House food is great service is wonderful the menu is absolutely spectacular all for a decent price if you're in Vegas and need a place to go this is the place you should choose congratulations Yard House well done,5
"Jenn was an amazing server, food was great, and the beer was cold.",5
The beer food atmosphere and employee are the best! We would total totally recommend this place. It's reasonable pieced too,5
Great spot for a large choice of beers. Good was pretty good too,5
"Good food at a reasonable price, for the strip. Friendly staff, huge bar, lots of TV's. Something like 100 beers on tap! Pretty large menu so I would be surprised if you didn't find something for everyone.",5
We always have fun. Great food,5
1st time there and definitely will go back.,5
"The place looks a bit dark, but it's nice and quiet. The personal attention was very good. The order is not delayed almost nothing and the food is very rich!",4
"Nice food, nice drinks, nice waiters/waitresses, nice restaurant. 5 stars",5
Good food. Large beer selection,4
Great atmosphere and delicious food. Service was very prompt and friendly!,5
"Great location, awesome selection of beer (over 100 taps), outdoor seating, great happy hour (including appetizer specials), vegetarian options, cool architecture and easy parking nearby. No complaints other than non-happy hour prices, but it's because of the Strip's typical overinflated prices.",5
Loved it! Great happy hour.,4
Really enjoyed the food and service.,5
Fun spot near the high roller. Sat at the end of the bar. Bartender didn't seem to interested in servicing us.,4
"Not very busy at the largest restaurant in the Yard House chain. We were immediately seated upon arrival. There were plenty of servers, but they were not attentive to the patrons, but seemed to have time to chit chat together.  Had to ask for refills on water. The food was average. Great deal on 2 Item Lunch Combo Specials for about $10.95.  However, read the menu carefully as there are up charges for specialty fries (garlic, or truffle oil, etc or onion rings).  Kevin should have mentioned, ""for an additional charge of $, you could add....). Turkey Club Sandwich had brittle toast (sandwich must have been drying out waiting to be picked up) and very cold sliced turkey meat. The Roast Beef Dip was the same, not served piping hot and the fries added for $1.95 were not freshly made, but soggy and tepid like they had been sitting out for awhile. The BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger had a great sized burger patty, but did not have lettuce or tomato just the cheese and beef. Our onion rings appeared to have fried twice, very crispy outside and no tender onion slice inside. The cup of clam chowder was delicious with the kale caesar, but we had to ask three different servers for the dressing on-the-side we had requested. We will not be back as it was a dissatisfying experience.",2
Delicious food. Tasty cocktails!,5
Great food at great prices,5
Mac and Cheese truffle is a signature dish it is beyond rich in flavor and texture. It was wonderful!,5
"Good food, great beer selection and good service.",5
Portion s to small ordered a filet $30 dollars was a small piece of end meat not worth the money at all fish tacos we're good but so small. Server was very good,2
"Great food, beer, service and pricing!",5
Great food and drinks. Happy Hour menu is great!,5
"Pretty good, nice clean place, good service, good burger",4
Good service and good beers,4
Service not good,1
"Love the amount of selections avaliable! Tons of beer selection, very good amount of food options and they also have a gluten-free menu. I ordered the vampire tacos and they were delicious. Other a la carte tacos like the Korean BBQ short ribs was also tasty; not over cooked and great taste. I would highly recommend this place for a group to go and eat!",5
Great place to eat staff was excellent,5
"Good food, fairly priced and a great wait staff.",4
Love the beer selection. Great place for pub food.,5
Great place for gathering and the food is wonderful.,5

Great happy hour.  Good food and drink. Good atmosphere.,5
"This place was awesome! The food was good, but a little pricey...it is Vegas 😁",4
"Huge selection of good quality beers on tap.
Very vegetarian friendly! Tons of veggie options quite yummy",5
What a great place to have awesome food and a lot of beers.  They have great service and plenty of options,5
Great food. Great service. A little hard to find. Its in the outside space between the LINQ and Flamingo hotels. Right by the high roller ferris wheel.,5
Huge selection of beers. You can get samples to see if you like it before buying a beer. Good menu. Big portions.,4
Best beer spot on the strip. Pablo was great and knew the beer selection very well. Place is a little corporate though.,4
"I come here everytime I'm in Vegas. It's busy, but the food is great. Try the truffle fries.",5
It is delicious. Love the beer selection... wait a minute... there's no beer selection because they have them all!!,5
Great bar to stop in while at The Linq . Friendly bartenders . Never ate while here . Actually we spent quite a few hours in here .,5
"Great service, tasty beers, good food. Definitely recommended! Though it is a bit noisy, but that's to be expected for a bar-type of restaurant",5
Food and service were good,4
I love love love this place never too crowded and the food and service always good,5
One of the better cheaper restaurants in the area. Beer selection is very good. Food is good.,4
"I ate here 2 nights in a row it was so good . They have a massive drink and food menu, great service and a really great location . I would recommend this to anyone because they have every type of food you can imagine . It’s great !!",5
The Food and service was amazing!!!,4
"The location is great, but the service was slow and my ahi tuna was so salty I couldn't finish it. I have eaten at the Yard House in Las Vegas before and it wasn't that bad (which is why I gave it 3 stars), but with all the other choices in the area I wouldn't chose this place again.",3
Good Vegas bar. A respite from constant gambling places. Food was cracking too.,4
Loved it!,5
Fast service. Very friendly staff.,5
we stopped here at least once every time we go to Vegas the prices aren't bad for drinks on the strip and there are plenty of options to choose from.,5
"Excellent  beer selection, decent happy hour (3-5pm).  This is a chain resteraunt, so its not a unique Vegas experience",4
Love it,5
"Nice atmosphere with seating where you can be outdoors
Good pretty good and prices resonable",5
I was looking for a place that served SOUR beer. The Yard House had several. They were really good. Food here is ok. The Yard House is a little on the pricey side.,4
"Like any other yard house -- good beer selection and decent food.  Has a nice and big covered patio.  Definitely worth checking out, especially because it is off the strip slightly so it is very relaxing to sit, chill, and have a few craft beers.",4
Great place for a reasonably priced meal,5
Meh. Filet and white cheese sandwhich was bland and so was the enchilada stack. Underwhelmed.,2
Fantastic food and drinks!!! Service is wonderful.  We came every day while we were in Vegas!!! 5 stars!!!,5
Great service. Great food,5
Best happy hour on the strip.  Good food and great service..Try the Poke Nachos if you like some heat and a super fresh bite.,5
Great food. Great beer selection. Just great!,5
Quick service and friendly staff. Good to roll through here around 3pm for Happy Hour,5
GREAT 🍷🍹🍸NOT JUST🍺,5
Great atmosphere and lots of food choices,5
REALLY good food and fantastic menu! The prices are excellent. Do yourself a favour and try this place. And this comes from *very* spoiled vegas guest ;),5
"Great food as usual, had the Californian Reuben which was tasty and the garlic fries which never fail! Waiter was good and water was refilled frequently, hostess were not very friendly though on way out.",4
Monique was an awesome server really nice and kept making sure that everything was good asked about refills and if anything else was needed.,5
"Steak and Brussels sprouts were great.
Wide selection of beers on tap.
However, service was decent.",4
Food was tasty. Portions could've been a little more generous,3
"It has a good variety  of foods  loved it. Had a lamb burger and brussel sprouts,  they were really hard but it was good.",5
"Great selection of beverages, great food excellent service. If your in Vegas its well worth a visit.",5
Great food and menu. Good vegan and vegetarian options.,5
"Awesome Beers, good food, great service!",5
Just okay and pricey. Felt it was like any American restaurant with a bigger selection of beer. It's in a very nice area though.,3
Service was good. Food over rated.  It would be better if you were drinking allot of booze.,1
Consistency good all round...great happy hour,5
"Very good dinner, lots of beer& and Andrew did s great job.",5
"Iffy service but always good food, for a chain.",4
"Fun, welcoming and very tasty!",5
Great food Great service!,5

Been to a few Yard House restaurants ~ always great food and service!,5
Amazing selection of beer. Exceptional service. Great food!,5
The only place in Vegas you can get a great beer,5
Found hair in the food,1
Meh.,3
Good food. I had lobster and crab salad,5
2 hour all you can drink for 15 bucks is nice!,5
Its all right. Lots of beer choices. Probably wouldn't go back as there's countless options in Vegas.,3
Great place to go with your friends.,4
Amazing food and drinks. Really great happy hour. M-F 3-6 PM.,5
Always a solid choice if you don't have plans yet,3
"Great service, great food! Highly recommend!",5
Crazy selection of beers at strip prices.  Chicken Cobb salad was fantastic.,4
"Food was greasy and the Taco tasted as if the grill hasnt been washed in a week.
The waitress was attentive and pleasent.
My advice is to skip eating their food and drink beer instead.",2
Amazing selection of beers on tap. Peanut butter stout beer was insanely good.,4
Good food and good beer.,5
The soup was good wish it was hot not warm temperature,5
"Great place. Best poké nachos, ever!!!",5
Always a great place to eat! Nice atmosphere. Lots of patio seating.,5
Excellent food and drink.,5
"Love it, good service",5

Classic yardhouse.  The best of best,5
"The Yard was great.... great service, food and brews just waiting to be chugged!!👍",4
Great beer selection and good prices for being on the strip.  I highly recommend the lobster mac and cheese,5
"Great service and great food! The waiters/waitresses were very tentative, they were constantly coming around to refill our drinks!",5
Great customer service. Hit or miss on the food sometimes. But still a good place. Open late like I love it.,4
Yard house is always a winner for us.,5
"Best Happy Hour deals, this place has fantastic food, great prices, friendly staff.",5
Food was great.  However we went on keg Tuesday so they were tapped out on lots of beer. Would try again though,1
"Incredible selection of quality craft ale, more than 180 keg beers available. Best ale house I've ever found in Vegas, not too busy during happy hour, excellent food too.",5
Great food and what a beverage selection! Nice off the main strip location.,4
Best food and atmosphere,5
Quite the selection of beers here.  I was impressed they also sample beers here as well.  (2 free samples per person if I recall),4
Fun and enjoyable place to hear great live music and celebrate with friends!,5
Really a great restaurant and bar next to the high roller. Service was excellent.,5
Decent beer selection and prices (for Vegas).  Great people watching.  Food looked okay too.,3
Excellent service and an extensive range of beers,5
"We've been to the Linq location twice (once ea at the other two) and plan to come back over and over again. Beer selection is magnificent, but even better, the food is absolutely top notch. I'm not vegan but some of my closest friends are. The vegan menu is terrific, too. Lots of possibilities to tantalize the palate. I tried one of the vegan dishes just to see what I was missing and it was sensational!

There are three locations in Vegas and one is near the Linq on the strip. If you're in Vegas and like good food and beer (or wine), you gotta check it out! It's not cheap, but it's worth the extra coin to get great food and service.

But, the background music is so loud it's annoying. Talking is difficult and ruins an otherwise nice experience.",4
Amazing selection of beer on tap. Very good salmon cellar salad and wings.,5
Excellent spot to eat at the link fast service a+,5
Good wasn't as good as the location in Boise. Complete lack of flavor and stale bread on sandwich.,2
Nice staff. Food is average. Nice place to hang out.,3
really good bar - amazing selection of drinks over 100 on draught ! Good selection of food and reasonably priced.,5
Had the Bacon Cheese burger and it was awesome! Cooked perfectly!!,5
Thank God they let us get a table and drink w/covid,5
"Fantastic variety of beers from all over the USA, including some of their own. Wide selection of foods, including a mouthwatering Korean pork belly taco!",4
Was in here the last time I was in Vegas and really enjoyed my dining experience great friendly staff and great sport bar,5
Amazing beers and food ..great atmosphere,5
"Awesome food, great service, and not over priced like everybody else in vegas.",5
A solid go to.  Good food and a great beer selection. Never dissapointed.,4
"Have visited a Yard House in Las Vegas, Honolulu and Tucson. Always consistently good, food and service.  Enjoy!",4
The meal was very good and the restaurant had a nice ambience.,4
Food was really good and our server was excellent,5
Good place with excellent range of beers and ales. Very busy with good service,4
Great service with a decent wait. That is expected for its location on the linq promenade. Abbie is an amazing server.,5
"I'm a fan of YH generally speaking.  An amazing selection of fresh draft beers that few other chains can touch.  Food is solid.  I knocked a star off for this location only because there are so many great choices on the Strip.  That said, you can't go wrong w/ YH and by Strip standards, prices are good for what you get.",4
Excellent burger and the service was super wonderful,5
Nice play with nice music,5
Food good prices are high.,4
Great selection of beer and alcohol. Great tasting food and service.,5
"Good food, good price.",5
Super tasty food and the atmosphere and staff were great.,5
"Great customer service,  food was GRRREEAATT",5
Delicious food and very accommodating and friendly staff,5
"Best tacos EVER! I tried the Vampire & Chicken Tinga tacos & my mind was blown. However,  There aren't a lot of menu options, and it is kind of pricey. Plus the customer service wasn't the best, but I would definitely go again. The mojitos were perfect!",4
Humongous selection of beers!! The hamburgers are great! California Ruben sandwich fantastic..try the truffle fries!😁😁😁😁😁,5
Delicious food and ridiculously large beer selection.,5
"Love the food,  great service,  great people",5
Great food and staff,5
Worst ever.  Sat at bar and was going to order food and several beers.  They wanted you to pay as go.  Only place in town that does this. Snotty bartender.  Go to the many other places that serve good beer and food.  And of course the beer glass was dirty,1
Great place just off the strip for drinks and food! Poke nachos were amazing!!,4
Friendly service and good food,5
variety of menu items ...staff and serivce was very good ...food was good and  reasonably priced ..we will return,4
"Food was good, service was on par, but nothing special",4
Amazing selection of beer. Exceptional service. Great food!,5
"Good food, the staff was helpful and polite.  Get there early, the restaurant fills quickly.",5
"Good food. Staff are friendly, coyrtelus, attentive, and the food is good. Nice menu section.",4
"I've been to the yard house in Seattle and was hoping for a decent beer selection, but disappointed by the lack of selection.  Other than the selection of beer the servers  were very attentive.",3
"Nice imaginative menu, large portions, friendly service. The vast beer menu is helpfully annotated and organized, so you learn while you drink.",4
Food was good. Moscow mule was decent.,5
Great choice of beers and good atmosphere,5
"Everything was amazing. The staff, the food, the drinks. It does get pricey, we spent 100$ and it was just the two of us but it was definitely worth it!",5
Great beer selection. Very friendly and accommodating staff.,5
"The beer selection as always is great can't mess that up and have had great food in the past but tonight we ordered the coconut shrimp and Moo Shu Egg rolls, since they are both deep fried it was obvious that the oil was old and both appetizers were on the very dark side of fry oil, we did eat them and all was cooked OK, I just know since I used to cook in my past that it won't kill you. We did tell  our server (Keala) (think that is correct) that the cook needs to change the oil but she really did not know how to answer just said ""Guess I do not have to ask if you want anything else"" Really ??!?? Really disappointed for food tonight. Had great service at the bar tonight were we sat but it was a really slow night on the bar side with 50% open but the seating side was full.",3
"Great food,  service and location",5
"The food was horrible. Do not order the Pizza, seemed like it was a frozen pizza from Walmart.  My ""Korean Barbeque Tacos"" were just bad, meat was like a chewing gum. The Lobster Pasta was miserable to look at. We spent there 117$ for NOTHING! This place is totally POOR VALUE FOR MONEY.  On top of the bad food we have the worst service. The waiter did not know the menue and could not recommend anything vegetarian for one person in our party and never checked in on us during our meal.",1
Great food and a mile of tap beer...what's not to love?!,5
"Great atmosphere and great food.  The ""gluten sensitive"" menu was somewhat small and you couldn't eat most of the accompaniments.  Artichoke dip sounded good but you couldn't have the flat bread or pita or house chips or fries lol.  How ever the rib eye entree was fantastic and I didn't have to alter it at all!  They offered 2 gluten free beers by Omission.  Not bad - I would definitley eat here again! Linette",5
"Excellent menu, great tasting quality.   Great music too",4
"Not entirely the worst place but definately not a return for me.

Feed was okay nothing spectacular.

Service was slow and the location wasnt overly busy.

Mediocre at best",2
Love Yard House! Tap beers and delicious food.,4
Great food and beer selection BUT USE YOUR TOTAL REWARDS CARD for easy points,5
"Best nachos, there were 11 people in the group and everyones food was great",5
Been here several times.  Has good food at a reasonable price compared to other places on the strip.,5
"Ratings were well deserved. Good food, relaxing atmosphere",5
Fast attentive service! Great job! Felipe!,5
Tasty food and huuuge beer selection,5
Great customer sevice and great bartender although she spilled water all over me. Accidents do happen. I ordered the mushoo eggrolls...a bit mushy  but tasted ok.,4
My favorite place in Vegas! Best selection of beer 👌,5
"Great relaxed park style beer house. They have giant Jenna and corn hole. Their beer selection is decent with a variety of traditional, local and special beers. The music is comfortable and the seating is nice as well.",5
Great service at the bar where we sat. The AC felt incredible. The food was fresh and came out quickly. They have quite a few beers on tap. Outside you’ll find table games and additional seating.,5
"This place wasn't what I expected it to be. For what it is, an American-style bar, it's good. The Beerhaus Brat is a plump, juicy sausage with a nice cheddar filling. The bun seems to be a potato bun with pumpernickel seeds. I wasn't a fan of the bacon jam that topped the sausage.",4
"Great relaxed atmosphere, with a a variety of draft beers and cans. A bit pricey but a good resting spot next to New York, New York. Recommend!",5
Good beer selection and food.  Service was outstanding!,5
Great beer menu tasty food. Good service! Perfect spot before George Strait concert at T Mobil Area!,5
Very nice atmosphere and good food. It was busy but space was available at a table. They have long tables so don't be surprised when someone sits down at the other end.,5
"Don’t come here expecting to watch a Vegas Golden Knights hockey game or have any type of Happy Hour. Despite advertising to “join” them for hockey nights, and the entire place being decorated with VGK logos and signs, they chose to play audio for football at full volume and NOT play the VGK games being broadcast on half the televisions. Our server requested management to change it (she was great) but we were told they were “waiting to see about the football game outcome”. So much for supporting your local hockey team! We won’t be back.",1
Nice vibes with good bar food! Highly recommend checking it out and it’s central,4
Cool place for a good time with friends. Gets very crowded and touristy. A live band was playing when I was there on that Saturday!,3
"Do not get a veggie dog. They taste like the ones I got 10 years ago in Indiana before the market got better.
Hockey night so too busy to replace of course.
I’ll be back to drink 🍺",3
"Games you can play at the table. Food was good. Came out wrong initially, but they took it back and fixed it. The wine was not good.",3
"This place is trash. Overpriced and overrated. Food was not great. Apparently, ordering a Cobb Salad with dressing on the side scrambles the brain of the dude at the register that lead him to getting frustrated with me telling me that “I was confused”. Based on that interaction alone, I will avoid this place in the future. Save your money and go the Shake Shack. Their food is infinitely better and half the price.",1
"Service at the table wasn’t that great. better go directly to the bar to order your stuff. music is a little loud but they have Jenga games on each table which makes it funny with friends, it’s a place to fiesta !",4
"Great food, awesome beer menu. Can’t ask for much more",5
"Not over exaggerating at all, this place is one of the best places I've eight on the strip for very reasonable.

The French Fries are to die for! They are thick yet crispy and very addicting, so be prepared!

Personally they are some of the best fries I've ever had. And were my favorite here from all that I tried.

I also had the pulled chicken sandwich, tasted healthy but I wouldn't recommend it or order it again.

The Pretzels with beer cheese dip were awesome!
FYI the Beer Cheese Dip also comes with the fries, highly recommended that you dip them!!

The Potato Skins were great but personally needed more sour cream!

The Salad with Chicken is tasty and a good size when ordering the large.

The Fried Pickles were in this fabulously tasty batter and comes with ranch making it even more delicious!!

This place is a must to come too! It's fast paced, open seating and great entertainment!!

You have to come here when on the strip! Eat up!!",5
"The music and vibes were good last night. The food was average at best, unfortunately it wasn’t really that special. I had the reuben and cheese bites. It’s convenient if you’re staying at the NYNY. Sarah was our waitress last night.",2
"I see why some the reviews here are so bad. The concept of the place is just horrible. You have to go get food at the front of the place (Yes they deliver it to your table). They have some mechanism that tells them where you are sitting. But for drinks other than beer or cocktails you have to go to front as well. The cocktail server can’t even get you water from the bar. You have to get your sodas up front as well. Also it’s first come first serve seating. So they don’t take reservations other than more than 25. We couldn’t get a table for 11 it was so busy.

The happy hour is good. Everyday from 2-4. 5 items on the menu for $5. We got hot dogs, loaded tots, and fried with beer cheese. All the food is great for the price of $5. They also give you a good amount. You can’t complain about that.

I just wish there concept was better. There’s so much commotion and confusion going on in this place.",3
Great place! I was happy to see they had the Mango Cart available =) its such a delicious beer!,5
stopped for drinks.  nice place to chill and play some jenga,5
"The atmosphere is great. We came during a slow time, and the service was fast. Ordered a hot dog, roast beef sandwich, and onion rings.  Very expensive for the portion size.",4
Pretty good burgers (impossible burger isn’t too bad) and chicken sandwiches.,4
"Go Knights Go, this is the bar to be at pre-game. The food was good and served quickly. It even has a fantastic range of beers to choose from. About an hour before face off the cheerleaders March past and to the stage. Great vibe.",5
"Visited twice on a recent stay at NYNY - it is right outside the hotel so great location!  Got the Impossible Burger both times so that is all I can comment on but it was so delicious and surprisingly the French fries, which can be an after thought, are some of the best I have ever had!  They have ample seating and I would recommend!  The missing 5th star is because of the price point.  The burger was $15 on its own and if you wanted fries they were an additional $7.  We found other Impossible burgers on the strip for $16.95 that included fries so we found Beerhaus expensive for what we got!",4
"Loved this place.  A sports bar in a great location....right across from Tmobile arena, just a few steps off The Strip.

The waiter met me at the table to take drink and cocktail orders. But told us we had to order food at the counter. The patron margaritas were delicious.

We got there at the tip off of happy hour. $5.00 food.
So my friend ordered one of everything. The deviled eggs, loaded tots, chicago dog (with relish, kraut and spicy mustard), fries. Beer.

All very yummy indeed. The only flaw was that the buns were cold. If they had been even mildly warn we could have enjoyed it all better.

What made this place the absolute best, though, was the Oregon Ducks game blaring on speakers and on most of the tvs as they took down the Washington Huskies for the Huskies homecoming game. That was the best!!!  Just like being at home.",4
"The drinks are good and it's a great location to chill and hang out right before the game.

The board games add a nice touch to the bar .

Food isn't to die for.... But if you're hungry it's decent.",3
Great place to have a cold one and watch sports. Large selection of beers on tap - try the tasting paddles too. Service was great.,5
Went there for snack and bites. We ordered wings with fries. Very yummy. 1/2 dozen of wings are 10 dollars. Wings with fries are 1r dollars.,4
"Nice new spot outside of New York, New York. Good service at the bar. Games for kids and adults alike. Lots of sports coverage on the many TVs. Wide variety of beers on tap, including some local taps.",5
GUYS THEY ARE OPEN. The hours on here are weird. But I’ve been here for four days and they have been open Thursday through the weekend during the afternoon. I saw someone say it’s overpriced. No it’s not you’re drinking craft beer you savage. Good atmosphere good vibe great service. Evette is awesome tip her well!,5
"Excellent selection of brews... TVs galore for game watching, beautiful staff, good food, what more can you want! Its right next to New York New York Hotel and down the street from the Arena. I'm going to be here daily.",5
"Great location, great bar to watch a game plenty of screens. Large selection of draft and bottle beers and some good food also

Jenga on every table almost, seating indoor and outdoor good spot to spend an afternoon.",4
"Great patio right in the acrtion,. Beer selection incredible. It gets super busy on a nice day. We were lucky to score a couple seats at the bar.",5
Brats are solid...Frito pie was legit and plenty of beers... Nice open floor plan and quick n friendly staff,5
"This is a nice laid-back type of establishment. There are giant sized Jenga blocks to play with, a fantastic selection of beers and the happy hour specials are deal breakers. A very casual place where you can catch up with friends on all the Vegas adventures you had.",5
"This place rocks!!! I'm really not a fan of the regular Vegas scene...this place blows the socks off of casinos and shows. Next time you're in Vegas, just come here and spend your money on beer brats, beer, beer cheese (and pretzels), and more beer!",5
"Great beer, nice hot dogs",5
"Great food. Had the house burger and loaded tater tots . All good and a great hamburger. Little pricy, but thats the way it is. Great place to hook up with friends before and after T Mobile events. If you can get a spot ! Very  popular Knights  hockey place to be.",4
Awesome food and great Stanley cup experience we absolutely loved it here.,5
"A beautiful and fun place. The food is very good, but probably not a meal. Very nice people and games to play while drinking or waiting or just to play.",5
"Great pub with a extensive range of craft beers on draft and can/bottle, we only tried the hot dog special and for pricing you couldn't go wrong.
They definitely lacked a good wine range for the other half so we only stayed for a couple",4
"Way overpriced and overrated. Great location to drive up sales during T-Mobile events, otherwise wouldn’t check them out. The open seating format is terrible as you don’t know who’s coming or going.",1
"About two dozen different beers in tap here, and another big selection in bottles. Food is semi-self served with a walk up counter, then delivery to you at your table. Good bar food selection with full meals, smaller dishes and sides. The beer is worth the visit as they have a half a dozen Las Vegas brews for the non-locals, like me.",5
"I like beerhaus, what's not to like with good music and drinks! The food was good also. The atmosphere is open which makes it great for a good breeze.",5
"Right next to the T-Mobile center,  was able to watch the Knights in play offs, great place,  food ok.",5
"Great beer, good service. Great place to watch the VGK games and still be apart of the action when games are away.",5
I  got the vegan chipotle dog. It was good but SUPER spicy. I like spicy food but I wasn't prepared for that spice level. If you are vegan and can't do hit food maybe try the other vegan dog.,4
Great beer selection and super service from the bar. Definitely a place to come to start a party. Sport playing on the t.v which is a bonus.,5
Great bar. Great burgers. Great service.,5
This bar is only useful for watching the knights get destroyed by the Avalanche,1
"Very disappointed in the shaved roast beef, had no flavor.  My friend had the brat that was boiled...no grill marks. And 2 canned 12 oz beers for $20, in a beer haus?? What a joke.",2
"Now that is a big tasty crispy chicken sandwich! Great food, great beer. Would come back again for sure.",5
"Beerhaus was definitely one of my favorite spots while exploring Vegas! It's a very chill venue with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating for small or large groups.  There are also seats at the bar that have charging stations just in case your phone is about to die.  The employees that work here are awesome and make the experience even better! Beerhaus has some local brews from the area that are brilliant! I remember having one that was a stout and it was so good that I had to get a second! And for being on the strip the prices out here are amazing! There are ton of board games inside, and games outside such as giant jenga.  I'd also recommend this spot if you're trying to catch a game too... numerous TVs are located throughout the bar.  This is a really fun spot to hangout with friends whether you're looking to have a chill night, kill some time, or just to grab a quick brew.  Will definitely come back if I happen to be back in Vegas soon!",5
Overpriced bar food but lots of TVs,3
Great happy hour specials. Both food and drink!,5
"Great happy hour specials with food / nibbles
Great selection of beer
In a good location and lots of seating",5
"Great beer and friendly staff! Plus if you are a Knights fan, its a great beginning bar. Beat the Sharks!",5
"Awesome beers, good prices - especially during happy hour (daily 2-4pm) - and our server, Ally, was friendly and knowledgeable. Stayed much longer than we planned and had a great time. Definitely recommended.",5
This place is a good place to watch a sporting event. I had the beerhaus burger and it was good.  There were a few people here to watch the game.  The service was also good.,4
Great food! The place is good and friendly staff.,5
"Great food, casual atmosphere. Hormone and antibiotic free, local food. An oasis of normal in the heart of Vegas.",5
"Great beer, right next to T-Mobile arena and outdoor seating.",5
"Nice beer selection, good atmosphere. Great place to catch a hockey game.",5
"Great place to nab both local and certain key national beers in a beer garden environment. They have a good mix of styles of beers, and go out of the way to keep a hand full of harder to find beers on draft as well. In addition to all the beer, they have a kitchen that fixes good food, of the hamburger, hotdog, and sandwich type.",4
I built a big tower and as you'd expect i was delighted at it.,5
Excellent idea and location. Even better selection of beers,5
Really a great fun atmosphere to have a beer and some dinner.,4
"Talk about false advertising! We went to this bar cause we heard great reviews. As we walked in at 5:30 pm on a Sunday, it was relatively calm with few patrons. We started looking at the menus and saw that happy hour was till 6pm on Sundays and live music starting at 6pm. Since the happy hour prices included $4 select draft beer, I wanted to know what selections were included. The bartender proceeded to mention that happy hour ended at 4pm. I thought really?!? She stated that the menu was wrong. With no attempt to rectify the situation, the bartender appeared to shrug us off. One of our friends wanted to get a coffee with Baileys, asked the bartender if she would be able to do it. The bartender stated that she didn’t know if they had coffee. Really?!? What happened to customer service? Is it lost on the profusion of customers that come thru the door allowing for a nonchalant attitude. We finished our round and left, never to darken their door step ever again. Disappointed. Did I mention that there was no live music apparently happening by 6pm... I tried posting a pic of the menu showing that the happy hour was till 6pm, but for some reason google isn’t loading it up after I post it with this review.",2
Great Bar and vast selection of beers from all around the world and IPA's.,5
Banger Brewery Morning Joe beer,5
Cool beer place,4
"Awesome place, amazing food. Entire vegan menu. Yum.",5
"Great beer food and a wicked beer selection. Great time during Vegas games. Jenga blocks on the tables outside to keep the crew entertained. Close to T mobile.

They serve Ryan Reaves beer there. ""75 training day""",5
"Tasty HotDogs, incredible atmosphere!",5
Great selection of beers and service. Always a friendly spot to stop.,5
Great selection and awesome happy hour,4
Solid draft selection with a lot of local beers. We got the fries with beer cheese and would do it again (especially during happy hour!),5
Let's drink beer and play Janga under the misters at the Beerhaus was AWESOME,5
"It’s alright. Won’t change your life, but it’s a decent, dog friendly option on the strip.",3
Wonderful location close to the arena with outdoor seating for people watching. Food has to be ordered at the counter and I was to lazy to get up. The service was quick and the happy hour prices were average for Vegas. Bad Beat wheat beer was quite refreshing after walking in the heat. I would definitely recommend.,4
"Cheeseburger. Over Salted and cheese looks like it came out of a can, horrible for $14",2
Slightly off the strip with decent beer and good food.,5
"Great spot to enjoy a meal before the hockey game. Tasty and we'll priced meals. More than enough beers available for anyone's taste buds. Make sure to get there early on game days. It is open seating format.
Great atmosphere with all the Golden Knights fans there.",4
"Great beer selection, tasty bar food and a all around great sports bar",5
"fried pickle are the must have!
great little spot just 50 yards from the srrip.",4
"Nice choice of beer. Had a private party going on which was fine. Get seated outside, no problem. Sit for about five minutes and then the hostess comes out and tells us if we want anything we would have to go up and get it ourselves! Should have had more wait staff for other guests. Will not go back.",1
"Happy Hour specials are on a tiny chalkboard. They don't tell you about them, but they are the best craft beer specials on the strip!",5
"Cool bar, quizzo, good selection of beers. Didn't get food but it looked good. Friendly servers.",4
"The staff and beer selection was awesome, however we rushed there to get the happy hour prices in a group of 10 and at 5:30 before happy hour ended at 6. We go to place our orders and the lady bartending tells me their own menu is wrong and that the bar will not honor their own prices on their menu. So one drink and we were out of there.....",2
"Great beer selection on the strip, and good atmosphere. The food selections are good, ranging from sausages and sandwiches to a few larger dishes.",4
"This used to be my favourite spot in Vegas. I come around twice a year and this was always the first place I’d head. I’ve recommended many of my friends to come here for the great atmosphere, good food and awesome beer selection. Unfortunately on my most recent visit they decided to rip me off and charge me for drinks I didn’t have. I raised this with the bar tender and he was insistent I did have those drinks (100% a lie). It’s not exactly big money. It was $4 happy hour. But it’s the principle of the matter. Don’t rip off your loyal customers.",1
"We stopped in based on a recommendation from a local.

Great bar with an awesome selection of local beers. We stopped in during their happy hour. A pint for $4 is a great deal. I had their lager and he had the IPA. Both were fantastic selections! They also offer a great happy hour food menu.

Wish it had been a bit warmer and we would have taken advantage of their outdoor patio tables.

Bartenders were awesome. Very attentive and friendly.

Will definitely come back next time we are in town!!🍻😎",5
Indoor and outdoor seating - live music - good place to watch sports.,4
Great selection of beer. Food comes out fast.  Good service. A good place to use that MGM food and beverage credit.,5
Was hoping for micro beers... new menu only has macro beers. Meh.,3
Great stop before AND after a Golden Knights game.,5
"Very good selection of beers. Plenty of space even for big parties.
You can also have some food (tried some burgers and fried chicken sandwich)
Recommended",5
"Pretty average burger.  Decent beer selection.  Absolutely lackluster.  Pricey for what you get.  Plenty of other way better spots on the strip.  Check out the tap house in the MGM if you want a great burger.  If you’re out of options, or have eaten just about everywhere else, then check this place out.  Upside - no wait.",3
Cool place but way overpriced.,3
Great beer selection and great atmosphere.,5
"We love this place, come here at least twice a year. Some of the best fresh tasting IPA 's you could find anywhere. Gotta  luv it!",5
"Nice location with good beer selection.  Service wasn’t the best though.  Also seemed over priced a bit, even for Vegas.

I’ve not tried the food before so I can’t speak to that.",3
"This is a fantastic, spacious bar with a great range of craft beers to try. The bar staff were incredibly helpful and showed amazing knowledge which really helped in suggesting drinks for our group. I imagine this bar is a great place to watch sport or visit in advance of a Vegas Knights game.",5
"Great place for appetizers and drinks.  We came here with kids (one of the few bars that allows for people under 21), and were very happy with the experience. There are a TON of games to choose from, including Jenga at every table.  The drinks are good, and the appetizers are delicious (highly recommend the fried pickles and wings).",5
Fun place to drink beer & play,4
"If you like processed food, fake cheese then this is your place. No Mac in the Mac and cheese bites and it is processed American cheese with some pepper jack flavor. Tots are covered in American cheese sauce.",2
"Happy Hour had reasonable prices, food tasted good. The outdoor tables had great views with TVs. Only issue we had was service was really slow. We had to track down a server to get our first drink, but after that it was really a great place!",4
"A must-visit, every time I come to Vegas. Service is usually great, and a wide selection of beer. The location and ambiance are very laid-back, a nice contrast to the bustle of most of the strip.",5
Not a bad place. Food is good. It has been super busy the times I have been there.  Staff could be a little more attentive but will not hesitate to go back.,4
This place has the best veggie dog I have ever had!! They also have fun games and host trivia nights. Definitely worth checking out,5
"This place is just as you'd expect. Ok food, lots of beer choices, loud music, outdoor seating, games. It's fun, but nothing special. Great spot to hit before an event at T Mobile.",4
"The beer was good, but had to wait 20 minutes before someone would serve us when it was only a handful of customers. People who came in after us was served before we were. Not sure if I would ever patronize their establishment again.",2
Hands down best burger I've ever eaten!!,5
"Food was good, drink selection was good, but we couldn't order food at the bar. We had to walk to a different counter and then go get it when it was done. Also, they kept the doors open when it was around 45°F outside.",3
"Happy hour daily 2-4pm. $5 hotdogs and $4 local beer. Can't go wrong when your are day drinking on the strip!!! 👌 Also this is the place to go before a VGK home game. Sit outside so you can people watch, listen to live music and enjoy the atmosphere.",5
"Great drink selection. It is a bit pricey even for Vegas. Good for large groups. Board games are available to play. Outside patio had picnic games. Live music on weekends is good, but loud. We use it as a meeting place as it is centrally located.",4
"We had our slot tournament, from new new york, awards brunch here. Good place to party and watch a game of hockey or football.  Just a stones throw from t- mobile arena. Good gathering place before and after the game. Good munchies and the beer flows !!!!",3
Oh so yummy! The burgers were amazing and the staff was friendly and honest. Love the indoor/outdoor seating and I'm sure this place is a blast when sports are on.,5
"I had a beerhaus brat for $10. The hot dog itself was really good, it came with 3 fried onions and a bacon jelly on top. Super expensive, but that's what you find at the strip. The bread though was a big disappointment as it was anything but fresh: it was dry as if it was sitting our for a couple of days. Beers cost around 10 bucks a pop, again, Strip prices. I'd go back for the environment though!",4
Great spot for a good selection of beer in a fun atmosphere.  Lots of outdoor seating and games like Jenga.  The only downside is the Vegas beer prices.,4
Went for a football game. Lots if screens and they play various games. They have some football specials. It's pricey but It's on the strip so yeah. Good place to chill before a Knights game.,5
Nice selection of beer. Great happy hour. Nice indoor and outdoor seating,5
Found this place while walking through The Park so we stopped for a drink and snack. They have a huge selection of beer from all over the world and offer samplers to try a few. We also had a giant pretzel with beer cheese which was awesome. We sat at the  outside tables with Polkas playing through the sound system and had a wonderful time. Nice place to get away from the busy City and relax.,5
"Incredible number of craft brews on tap with a good menu of tasty bites to go with it.  Not right smack dab on the Las Vegas strip so a little more ""homey"".  Casual atmosphere and all are treated as valued customers.  Get a bite, have a pint and enjoy!",5
Awesome cold craft beer. Very friendly service. We went at happy hour and they ended up extending the happy hour as long as the band was playing. The food was amazing too! We would come back in a heartbeat.,5
"The atmosphere is upbeat with plenty of fun energy. Perfect place to watch the Golden Knights in action! Highly recommend the Vegan City Dog... I could eat ten of those... They are so flavorful (I am not a Vegan, so that cannot be used as an excuse not to try it)!",5
"The Beerhaus is a centrally located mid strip. Huge selection of draft and bottled beer. I am a huge believer in supporting local craft beers. This place has many local brews readily available. Being an hope kind of guy, the ""Hop Nuts 18B Pale Ale"" is a great choice & my personal favorite.. This place has food, plenty of space and live music..",4
Exactly what it should be.  Good beer selection.  Limited food menu but the food is good.  Good amount of TVs with an open patio area and live music outside.,5
Good beer. The specials are pretty good. Next to the t mobile stadium is a good spot.,5
"The cheese fries here are delicious.
The staff is very nice and attentive.
Their happy hour has to be the worst happy hour ever experienced. Selection and price wise. Don't come here to drink...just pass by for some cheese fries",3
"Beerhaus is, in a word, okay. It's a bar at a casino, so the prices are high, then they put sales tax on top of it, so it's not like a real neighborhood place.

It'll do in a pinch. There are better places off strip.",3
"The beer, live music and food were good. The service was slow and lacked something... oh yeah actual service. Seemed like the staff was phoning it in from home. I asked for plain tater tots and got bacon cheese and sour cream. It was pretty tasty but not what I ordered. So I really cannot do better than 3 stars out of 5.",3
Looks like it could be cool at the right time. Table board games. Live music. Food looked good. But it can get very packed which is why I'm sure the service was lacking and shoddy this time... I left within 10 minutes due to seating issues,3
Great bar! Lots of lagers and ales to chose from. Either draft or from a bottle /can. Happy hour is 2pm to 6pm and selected drinks are $4 each! Right next to the T-Mobile arena just off the main strip behind New York New York Hotel. Great find 😁,4
"Cool, fun bar right by T-Mobile Arena. Games,   food and beer are all pretty good. Keep in mind it is right off the strip so prices are very inflated.",4
"When you just want to sit back and relax mid-strip, this is the place to do it. It's pretty laid back and is just set back far enough off the main drag that ots kinda quiet. Decent beer selection and the food looked great, but we didn't eat.",5
Great food and drink and reasonably priced.  Fast service and convenient to TMOBILE arena.  They were a bit disorganized in their communication with outdoor dining.  They said someone would take our order and that wasn't the case. We had to go to separate counters to order and they bring the food out only.  We sat and waited for about 15 minutes and no one took our order.  Haphazard but overall a good experience.  I have been there before and dined inside so this was a little bit different..,4
Pretty good. Was here for happy hour! They have larger than life Jenga outside,5
I had the meatball sub and fried pickles. My wife had the beef sandwich and a salad. I really enjoyed mine. My wife wasn’t a fan of her meal. The beef sandwich was straight up cold and the sauce was weird. The salad was basically iceberg lettuce with some dressing.,3
Awesome happy hour dogs and brats!,5
Good atmosphere and a large selection of beer. Service was fast at the bar and by the servers on the floor. The food looked good. I did not eat though.,5
Fantastic barbecue on the menu. I'll be back soon to try other items. Fries were great.,5
"Fast app service. Good beer selection. Reasonable prices, especially for vegas",5
Fantastic. Brilliant place to spend an afternoon with some of the best beers Vegas has to offer. Brilliant bratwurst too! Great outside space and good live bands.,5
"We enjoyed the outdoor patio seating. Tried some new craft beers. Had a couple of appetizers that were  tasty and filling.
A good stop off while you're making the trek down the strip.
Service was prompt  and friendly.",4
"I came here with a party of 5 around 3pm on a Saturday. It was not busy, around 15 people. 1st there is a posted daily happy hour (except for event days), which is like everyday in Vegas. But whatever. There is a great beer selection.  It is a seat yourself setup and you can order at the bar or a waiter will come to your table. None of the waiters even glanced at us, but took orders from every table around us. Which  was pretty annoying. Also, when we sat at the table it was sticky and i asked if I could wipe the table down, I was told they would send a waiter over. They never came. I eventually flagged someone down. This seems like a cool place, but I'm rating it low for the horrid service. We did not try the food as planned because everyone in the party was pissed we were ignored.",2
"Great location in The Park next to New York New York and the T-Mobile Arena.  Wonderful selection of beers and some vegan options on the menu - vegan city dog was my favourite.  Good service to go with it,  so it adds up to a 5 star review from me.",5
"First time I went in was for the Leafs game (Go Leafs Go!) and it was such an exhilarating experience due to all the Leafs fans. Great selection of beer, decent food and a great atmosphere.",4
"Very chill place, knowledgeable staff, food was great with huge portions and not overpriced. Nice place to hangout, have a few beers and watch the game.",5
Great selection of beer. Very friendly and beautiful staff (really). An absolute must if you're a Knights fan.,5
Liked it a lot. Location is cozy. Beers were good but not great. Food was OK. It is worth a stop. Vegas is growing up and this area is testiment to that. Check it out if you are into beers and grub.,4
Nice place to pop into and get away from the Strip or get away from TMobile Arena. Beer selection is endless and they have typical bar food to munch on. TVs galore so you can catch just about anything you want to watch. Staff were accommodating with channel changing.,4
"Happy hour food and drink (2pm - 4pm) well worth seeking out, though avoid the chips and onion dip, not pleasant (hot dog and tater tots are a much better bet - one portion of the tater tots is enough to share)",5
"First visit- brought friends from out of town for craft beer and the server had absolutely no clue about ANY of the beers available, she was never around and simply embarrassing to my guests.
Second Visit - went on NYE 2020 around 7pm with my fiancé and food was ok, service at the bar at was decent, however, they charged my card for over $340. Our bill was $166 and we left the bartender $40 cash tip and had food, appetizers and some drinks. It took over 9 days to return my money. I will not return for a third disappointment.",1
Food was ok. Not great. Not unique. Not special. Service left so much to be desired. I can't see myself visiting this place again. When you visit Vegas you expect everything to be an experience. This was not that. Didn't hate the place but I don't have a great testimonial to offer either.,3
Excellent beverage selection and great service.  Nice patio as well.,5
"The local brew, food & ambiance were great! We've been here 45 minutes, though, and the bar waitress has completely ignored us. It must be self-serve night!",3
"All the selection I need in food...and endless in beer!!!! Very fast service and the venue and hostess are fantastic.
Open and airy and they have board games that we can play at the tables.
Highly recommended.",5
"Nice food and drinks in a very nice atmosphere. Perfect for game days at t-mobile arena
Only a bit pricey!",4
"Clean, nice staff, and an amazing beer selection. Servers were knowledgable and happy to offer recommendations. Any beer enthusiast would be happy to grab a tasty bite and brew.",5
"Light and airy with lots of room, opens to The Park. A much needed respite from the loud, stinky casinos and madness of the strip just a block away. If the food was terrible I would still be happy to sit here! But the food is great and not priced 150% high like everything else on the strip. A half roasted free range chicken, great salad, roasted potatoes and onions for $15 has to be one of the better deals you're going to find this side last minute half-priced Thunder from Down Under tickets! And the beer selection is great, service was excellent too.",5
Just wish it was bigger! Its always a full house on game nights and I'd like to sit for once and eat a little something before going to a game. I want to enjoy it all the way through,5
Love their chili dog. Very filling with all the toppings. Make sure you get a fork to get every bite. 😀,5
Great selection of beers on tap. Ample seating. Service can be a bit slow.,5
Great atmosphere.  Sports on every tv on Saturday.  Food good. Beer good. Great people who work there and friendly.,5
Good ambiance in and out of the place in front of the T-mobile Arena. Great while the temperature isn't too high at night and even greater during Golden Knights games! Price a bit on the high end but I'd say worth it and great selection.,4
"Staying across street for work event, easy access.
Food choices are limited, but quality was good, love the Vegas prices though.
Beer selection was solid, waitress Danielle suggested a brand of my preferred style that I had never tried, it was good, kudos to her!",4
"Pretty decent beer menu, good pub food and courteous staff. We went there twice while in Vegas last week.",4
"Fantastic beer selection, great atmosphere. When you're tired of gambling and just want to grab some beers with friends this is a great place to do it",5
"Food was good and the wait staff were attentive but a couple of the bartenders were surely.  If im waiting at thw bar and an idle bartender makes eye contact with me, they should at least acknowledge me, even if its not their section.  Pure laziness.",2
"Food and service are good; however, we stopped by to have a few drinks and watch a football game.  The game would freeze.  The commercials would play done but not the game.  This was very frustrating!",3
"Food is great. The fries and beer cheese dip are a must-have. Happy hour prices are amazing m-f 2-4pm. If you're in a hurry, before vgk games they have all beef dog and chips $5.",5
"I love this place. Awesome live music that adds to the experience. The food was great, and to top it off they got Jenga on the tables to challenge those who dare!",5
"Was there last night for game 2 of the Stanley Cup and graf a great time! Melissa our waitress was on top of everything we needed, Lee the manager was awesome! Great beers and food, definitely going back!",5
"Good food, great beer list, way to expensive in all ways. How come the ""cheap"" beer I get in my city, is the ""expensive"" beer at this place? Doesn't make sense.",4
Great place. Outdoor tables with TV's tuned to sports. Good prices.,5
"No table service at all, counter service was rude and dismissive. Food was bland. I’d review drinks if anyone actually bothered to take our order.",1
Love this place! Stopped here for lunch one day and enjoyed being able to play Jenga and other games that they had at the tables. Very relaxing and fun place to hangout. Would really recommend checking out.,5
Loooove their pork belly! If u love animal fat u have to try it! i seem to have better luck with their appetizer menu... main course & sausages are just so so.,4
Such a nice place!  Enjoyed a cold beer while sitting outside.  Great service!,5
Nice place in a great location. Tried the BBQ  rib combo and it was tender/tasty. Have to like fried or BBQ for food choices. Most were satisfied with the beer selection,4
"Happy hour ends at 4, best time to get beer and food! Great place for a snack and a beer, super chill.",4
"Great selection of beer. Twice now they've run out of food items on three menu and by far the least friendly bar staff.  Been there 4 times twice after hockey games and I get that it gets crowded and it's hot but also been there twice where it was slow and half empty, and 3 out of 4 times the bar maid seemed as if you couldn't be bothered to help us.",3
"Great place for a drink, and some real ale. Lagers are great and good ciders too. Good snacks and you can play board games too at your table.",5
"Veggie dog is decent. Fries ok. High prices for what the food is. Nicely decorated. Slightly fun casual atmosphere, outdoors and games makes it nicer. Less busy than the places right on the strip. Plus it's in a pretty area",3
"Nice chill place, not super packed on a Sunday afternoon which is nice. Good selection of beer with a number of local brews.",4
Fun atmosphere but customer service is lacking. Bar tenders are not friendly,3
Some good brews at this bar. They have good bar food like burgers etc. It is convenient right on the strip.,4
Great happy hour prices! Sin City Amber was really good + great hand cut fries!,5
This is a great place to watch the hockey games from if you don't have tickets.  You are still in the thick of the action and surrounded by fans....food is ok and beer selection is good.  It gets busy and can take a while for service.  Overall a good spot.,3
Great seating area.  Easy to move around.  Big beer selection with rotating taps.,5
A very friendly place.  They have yard games and live music in front of the bar in the park.  The food is great.  Fun place to be when the Golden Knights have a home game.,5
"The beer selection is quite extensive and includes a little of something for every beer drinker. The happy hour specials are great. The  ambience is modern and inviting. TV's abound for sports and most importantly Hockey as it is next door to the T-Mobile Arena. Also, bring your charger and plug in under the bar while you rest you feet from all the walking you do in Las Vegas.",5
"Food is at the to go window and there is seating to eat or drink.  Drink service is via the bar or wait staff.  The cheese fries are amazing, and I always get the hot dogs.  There can be major waits if there is an event going on at T-Mobile arena, but it's a great atmosphere and not super expensive, as the strip can sometimes be.",4
Awesome experience.  We started the night at anotner place but the staff was rude.  The employees here are awesome and they have a good selection of beers.,4
"Awesome!  Hung out here for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. Great atmosphere, great beer selection, and our waitress Aggy was the coolest. Seriously one of the best places on the strip.",5
"Manager would not turn up the volume for the playoff, Dal vs Green Bay , never mind the whole restaurant was packed with football fans. Manger  stated the restaurant does not caterer to football fans and it's not a sports bar. Upon arrival the waitress told us that come game start the music was going to be turned off and of course it was not. After we half  finished with  our food order we left to another place where there was no music and must more  friendly place.

The fries were salty and dry with no favor. The pork sandwich was dry and did not care for it. I would not order it again. I left half the fries and did not finish the sandwich. If your a sport fan with money to spend don't go there to eat. Disappointed with manger and food.",2
"Good beer, and nice location looking out on the Park. Odd way to get food though (by walking up to a single area at one side of the long space) and a limited food selection. There is no indication of how to order, and we sat at the opposite end from the order window, we saw quite a few people waiting for a server and giving up. This place has a good future, but has some kinks to work out first.",3
Best place to get the greatest selection of beer! The servers are fantastic! You can even go to the the little food shack in the corner by the door and get some food. A great place to kill some time or just hang out for a bit.,5
Frito chili is really delicious. I also tried the patty melt which was just okay.  Place is great for large groups or sporting events. Free board games are available for use.,3
Food was good but servers seemed like they didn't want to be there. Very unfriendly.,3
"Fast and delicious food. Great vegan options, too!",5
"Fun place , good food, let us bring other shops food , very kind, fun choices of beers, plenty of t.v.'s, gr8 location off strip, outside new hockey arena. On way to arena sorry",4
Great neighborhood bar experience in the middle of the crazy Vegas experience. Feels like home.,5
"Next to T Mobile arena. Beer, fun, and games. Outdoor sitting",5
Great place to meet before the Golden Knights play. Very busy. Good Happy hour of you can make that time slot. The bacon wrapped dates are amazing,4
"Terrible, terrible service. Tried to go to bar to get drinks and they sent us back to table to wait for a server that never came. Went back to bar to get  drinks and ignored. Advertised happy hour but said it was a special occasion so wasn't offered. Food, ordered at a separate counter, was good! Very disappointed overall.",2
"Great for Happy Hour; select bears 1/2 off. Next to Las Vegas Strip and eatery places. Fun games like Jenga, Chess and others available too. Sorry no pix, but I know your smart and can look them up yourself. ✌",5
"Great food, good prices, love the atmosphere, and the employees are super friendly. We'll definitely be going back.",5
"Good beer selection, but they are serving beer way too cold, to the point where there is no foam and the taste is definitely adversely affected. Good selection, but I'd rather taste the beer the way the brewer intended. ""As cold as possible without freezing"" isn't the correct temperature.",2
"Sat done they had huge jenga, waitress came right out recommend a beer I would like. Cashed right out. Great spot to sit and eat or just hit for a beer on your travels down the strip",5
Many beer choices as can be imagined. Food was good as well.,5
"Vegan menu featuring such items as the Impossible Burger, And house vegan chille dogs. The food is great, but expect to pay around $15 a plate (and that doesn’t include the fries by the way- Those are $7 extra.)",5
The wings and Mac and cheese are tasty. Staff really nice I ended up going there twice during my stay in Vegas!,5
"Fun environment. Great for Knights pregame. Food is good, great beer selection. Not a fan of ordering in line at the counter; then finding a seat and ordering drinks separately.",4
"Place is laid back and staff are very friendly.  Their beers aren't inexpensive, but then what is in Vegas....",4
The happy hour was pretty good as we sat outside in the afternoon. It wasn't too busy and the bathrooms were clean. My family also seemed to enjoy the cheese fries.,4
Decent food and many beers to choose from. Only issue is that you have to order the food and most beers in 2 different locations.,3
Sarah was extremely helpful and very knowledgeable about the variety of beers they have on tap. And she loves dogs..,5
"Beerhaus has a great location, good amount of taps,  and a nice amount of screens if you're looking to watch some sports. Other than those three things they really don't have much going. The food (shaved tri-tip sandwich and quesadlillas) was OK, really not much going on flavor or quality wise. The employees were some what attentive but not very friendly. I doubt I would visit again.",3
I’ve been back twice.  Love the food beer and atmosphere. It’s in a very clean and quiet area right off the strip.,5
Great customer  service. And good prices,5
"This place is pretty decent. Good beers, local and other craft. Didn't try any food. Good for games.",4
Chicken sandwich was good. Trip not so much... Good beer selection.,4
Place looks cool,5
"I go to Beerhaus every time I go to Las Vegas, they have a good beer selection and the service has always been very good. When I was there today, the bartenders were invisible. Very disappointing.",5
"Good food, good beer, but terrible service. Ordered food and was told it was open seating. Food guy was great and brought us our food quickly, but we had to find our own drink menus. Finished eating without anyone coming to ask if we wanted anything to drink, went to the bar to order and never once had wait staff ask if we wanted anything else or how our experience was. Nevermind we watched them pass our table constantly with other peoples orders. I would understand if we were tucked back into a corner in the dark but we were sitting right next to a pay station and in the middle of the bar!",2
"Fun atmosphere with the outside seating and games.
HOWEVER - the service is terrible...nobody came to our table to help us; stood at the bar for 15 mins waiting while the same bartender serviced 3 gentlemen multiple times with no acknowledgement of our side of the bar. When we were finally greeted, it was not welcoming or friendly at all :-(
so excited to come here - VERY disappointing...",1
"They have Veg options which is what I always look for. Vegan City Dog Sausage and the Vegan Chipotle Sausage. There are fried pickles and One other Vegetarian option on the rotisserie section. Service was great, let them know it was my first time and they went above and beyond to explain the order here sit here process to my group. There is a huge selection of beer so we will be back to try more.",5
Favorite place for relaxing and for taking our kids to have a little fun with games. Happy hour specials are out of this world,5
The food is really good. Good selection of beer. If you are here to see the Golden Knights play this is a great place before or after the game. It's really close to TMobile arena.,4
Great place to catch the game.  Atmosphere was great and was good.,5
"The craft beer tastes extremely good, and the Cobb salad is very fresh and tasty.",5
Beer line up and atmosphere are solid. Loved that they had Augustiner on the menu.  Only drawback is that the service was mediocre at best.  Bar staff seemed indifferent to helping us out.,4
"This place has great service, beer and food. Get there for the happy hour and play some games. It was our favorite place to hang out on the strip.",5
"This place is great, they have shuffle board, ping pong, board games. They have Jenga at every table. Plenty of beers to choose from and there food is really good. Highly recommend if you want to have beer in a fun and laid back place.",5
"A great place, good atmosphere, friendly staff, and they sold gluten free beer! which was great for our group",5
"This place is more about the setting than the food, which was okay. Beerhaus has indoor and outdoor seating with a relaxing environment.",3
It is a good place.  Food and beer was good.  Service was very good.  Good place to eat.,3
Great place for drinks with the family. Loads of board games. Free refillable for the kids as well.,5
Excellent selection of cold beer.  Nice menu and food was very good.,5
Great drinks and food for watching your favorite team.,5
Great atmosphere.  Great choice of beers. Ribs are great.,5
Great happy hour and staff at the bar are warm and amazing. Hard to believe it’s on the Strip in Vegas. Bacon wrapped dates were simply amazing!!!,5
"Great Beer selection.  Also try the fried pickle spears or beer cheese pretzels.  Both were good.  Finally, plenty of board games and TV'S to keep you occupied.",5
"Nice place, good beer selection. Only thing I didn't care for is you have to order and pay for your food separate. There should be a way to include it on your bill.",4
not bad,4
Food was good. Not sure how I feel about ordering at the counter and having it delivered to the table. Adult beverages had a separate  cocktail server.,3
"Free range chicken sandwich is amazing, as well as the pretzels with beer cheese! And the beer selection is on point! A great place to grab a pint and a bite!",5
Fun place for drinks close to T-Mobile Arena!,4
"A great range of decent beers, some on tap and some bottled. The live band was pretty good, too, doing a good job of entertaining he crowd but also not being too loud to allow others to talk. Service was okay, too.",5
"Cool, chill and fun! Had the Impossible Burger. OMG was it good!!!",5
"Nice bar outside of the arena. Seating inside and out games on the tables,  food was ok. Bar Food. Staff was great.",4
Good selection of draft beer. Good food. Enjoyed the pretzels and beer cheese a lot.,4
"Nice outdoor patio area, great local beers (cold), and friendly service. Nice place to stop when you wandering around the strip.",5
"Honestly don't waste ur time or money here. Food is HORRIBLE!! All they do us pour bbq sauce over ribs and wings are charge $20. Waitress only bring alcoholic drinks, for anything else you have to get up and go order ur food cafeteria style. At their price points a lil service would be good.",1
Good beer selection nice atmosphere and  lot of board games. TVs everywhere excellent place to watch sports games and good DJ after the game.,5
"Great happy hour and perfect beer menu.   Fun atmosphere and decent, well priced food",4
"Really great gem hidden in Queen Anne. Looks like a drug deal gone bad from the outside but you will be pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere inside. They can get a bit swamped when busy, which is most of the time, so plan for a wait.",3
Golden Knights beer!!!,5
"Hot dog sausage was good, but you would think  if you are going to pay $10 for a hot dog they would at least serve it in a fresh bun. Bun seemed to be a week old.",2
"This place is a lovely oasis from the heat complete with many delicious beers available, not only on tap but also in bottles.

I had searched all over the place on my trip to the USA to finally find Miller High Life here.

Bar is the place to sit and chat to the friendly staff as well as watch the other brews be poured and think about which one you are going to sample next.

Did not eat here, but the menu looked amazing.",5
"Inadvertently ended up eating here as we walked past it and we were super pleased.  Great variety of classic pub fare in this nice, modern bear house with outdoor bench seating that is within The Park at Las Vegas serene grounds.  You can easily see the multiple TV screens in the indoor potion of the restaurant if you sit in the patio.

The Crispy Chicken sandwich with spicy pickles and chiptole coleslaw on a brioche bun was fantastic! Deliciously crispy chicken with great seasoning.

Their fries are phenomenal,  you could tell they were fresh cut and not previously frozen, ust how i like them and sprinkled with sea salt.  You can get beer cheese for dipping, my dad opted for it; very tasty with a hint of spice.

We also had the pepperjack mac n' cheese bites with ranch dressing that were AMAZING!  A very crispy crunchy exterior coating that wasn't overpowering and perfect texture of mac n' cheese in the interior.

Sorry no picks, again another too hungry and needed to dive in moment.",5
Little pricey for dawgs but good atmosphere.,4
"Such great bands Everytime I go, just can't get enough",5
Fantastic place to meet up and grab drinks before a hockey game.,5
A must place to go for beer lovers! Staff is very knowledgeable and helpful  makes you feel like family love this place can't wait to get back next time we get to Vegas,5
Best place I have found in this area for craft beer. Can't go wrong with Delirium Tremens. Great selection overall,4
This place is ok. Beer selection is alright. However there is only service at the bar and there aren’t nearly enough bartenders. In addition you have to order food at another counter separately which is just stupid. They have a decent selection of local and hard to find beers though. I just think the experience could be better. Definitely one of those places that is trying to do as much as possible with as few staff as possible. The food was ok. I enjoyed the brat. Probably not worth the cost but nothing in Vegas is.,3
"Arrived at 4:30 for happy hour (2 to 6 per website) and were told ""no, its 2 to 4.....sorry, website needs to be updated."" Get it fixed or honor what you advertise! No service on patio....we had to go into the bar despite being told someone would be by. Bartender had a terrible attitude...she was unfriendly, disinterested and rude. Even sitting at the bsr....plastic cups for our $10 beers. We are locals and will not go back.",1
Great beer hall atmosphere. Fantastic beer list.,5
"New location, friendly staff. Seems like an awesome place and Happy Hour prices are a bargain on the strip. Oh,  and the beer and food is good also.",5
"This place has a good beer list, good food (shaved tri tip sandwich was real good) and great location.  I wanted to like it.  But the service is terrible, impossible to get someone to come to your table for drinks.  I asked 3 different runners if we could get someone to come to our table to order drinks.  And they have a confusing way to order food which you don't do at your table.  We finally gave up after 20 minutes and ordered beer next door at cpk.",2
Great beer selection. Played some board games while stopping in for a drink. Nice staff as well,5
I just love this place so much that I keep coming back.  This is where I loveeeee to bring my visitors when they are in town.  Happy New Year!,5
Yvette was great! They were short-staffed and she's still taking care of most of the bar better than anyone I've ever seen,5
"Solid 3 star selection of craft beer, but for Vegas it's graded on a curve. Tucked just off the main boulevard so it's a little less crazy. Good live music the evening we stopped by.",4
not as many craft beer on tap as I tought,4
"Good selection of beers, but scrappy food options.",2
Fun games to play outside while waiting for the arena to open!  Good beer.,4
"This is my first time here.  The food was OK, there was no service, very busy,  beer was cold but the band (Brett Arthur Rigby) was awesome!  If they keep booking acts like him, I'll be back.",4
"Great beer selection, not too expensive, limited but tasty food selection. Good bar atmosphere with big tables and lots of games to play! Wait staff was trendy and friendly, if a bit slow",5
"Great beer and food, great staff.",5
Nice place for beer and you can play some small indoor games like business card etc..,4
Nice place. The food was delicious and servers were very helpful and nice. Thanks!,5
Great beer selections and right next door to the Hockey area,5
"It was ok. Plastic glasses but think that was due to day before new year. Bar man did not know about the beers which I thought a bit odd for someone one working in a place that sells lots on draught....maybe just my expectation.
Lots of sports screens and the food looked good (I did not eat)",3
"The beer selection here is great!
The location is perfect for Knights games and for if you're staying at Park MGM or New York New York.

There's a good amount of seating inside as well as a large patio-style area out in front.

If there's a Knights game, it will be packed! Be cautious of that.

One suggestion: it would be nice to have a more clearer and maybe larger walk up space at the bar, for when it is busier. There is a togo/walkup in the front but the beer selection is limited.",5
Happy Hour everyday 2p-6pm Beer and Dogs! Relaxing Atmosphere! Fun!,5
"Horrible, simply horrible. Food was decent but how could anyone put up with such a staff. Pure incompetence by the manager to handle situations such as the staff completely forgetting to put the order in the system and looking dumbfounded while they try to figure out what to do. When asked to just refund that order the manager snarked ""whatever"". There are many other amazing places to attend at the strip or the greater Las Vegas area. This is NOT one of them. Will not be surprised to see their doors close as quickly as they opened. All for the best.",1
Food was good. Took 45 plus to get a drink menu and another 30 to actually get a drink when it wasnt busy.,2
"Awesome food and if course, beer !!!  Super chill and moderate prices.",5
"Very cool place. Free games to play like Jenga, Checkers, Chess. Order at the bar, food comes fast. I have a Beerhaus Sausage and it was great!",5
"Great service, fun selection. Affordable foods! Solid happy hour, too.",5
I am originally from Germany and I can definitely say their bratwurst is authentic. Great meeting place to hang out with family or friends.,5
"Nice variety on tap. Bar tenders were friendly. Didn't eat anything but the fries, which were awesome. I'd visit again.",5
Lots of craft beer on tap.  Both local breweries and well known breweries from around the country are well represented.  $4 beers for happy hour between 2 and 6pm.,5
Awesome food and drinks. Sit down relax play Jenga  enjoy the music. Great people!!!,5
Good service sitting at the bar.  Friendly staff.  Great beer selection.  Food is mediocre.,4
"Good place to hang out, lots of outdoor seating.",4
"You need to come up with some gf/df options and educate your staff.

I had to wait 15 minutes while they kept going into the back to see if something was workable.

A lot of people - like me - have allergies.

I couldn't stay, you had nothing I could eat.",1
Suprised at how much we enjoyed the food and the laid-back ambiance was most enjoyable. Quick walk off strip from the neon lights and bustle; lovely outdoor space with games just next to the new arena.,5
Nice venue and music. Good beer variety. Came at 12 and looked short staffed. Just fine on my opinion.,2
"Good beer, great service.",4
Good spot near the New York New York and Monti Carlos hotel. Inside outside bar with old fashions on tap. Weird but good.,4
"Food, is horrible and limited.
Wait Staff, is most unfriendly.
Music, is usually Great.
As a local, this place is ok to visit if you have nothing to do want to hear live music or watch drunk tourists.",1
Was a great place to eat! The brats were outstanding and the fried pickles were eaten up quickly! Will be back the nextt time in Vegas,4
Great place for pre and post game drinks!,5
We loved the apps and good beer selection the first time we went. Unfortunately we went on a slow day and the closed a half hour early and we were turned away for food.,4
"Excellent Food, Fabulous Staff And Service, Great 🍻 Selection 🎯",5
"Went here on a Saturday night with friends to watch week zero of college FB and hang out.

Positive:
Good location
Reasonable ambiance

Negative:
All food must be ordered at counter even if you are seated at table.
Out of multiple beers

Big Negative:
Ordered two shots of JW Blue
I watched as the bartender poured the first shot and then had almost nothing left in the bottle for the second.  He then walked over to two other bartenders and asked if they had another bottle. No was the answer.  So then he walked over the the main guy (manager) and asked what to do and he told him to just pour out some of the first pour and make two level 1/2 shots. When the waitress brought them over I inquired about how I was basically getting 1.5 shots AT BEST of EXPENSIVE whiskey and she went back and checked with bartender who informed her his first shot was an ""overpour"".  If that's the case, why ask for another bottle or ask what to do when you didn't have enough to fulfill two shots?  They still charged full price for the shots even though they comped our group a couple beers for not having the beers we ordered.  So they will comp inexpensive beer, but if you order expensive whiskey, you get nothing. They should have let me know they only had enough for one shot rather than serve two inadequate shots. Not a big deal if $10 shots, but they charged $51/shot and I definitely didn't get my money's worth.

Before anyone says I should have contacted the business.  I tried.  I talked to the waitress and got an excuse.  I tried contacting online and by  phone and got no response.

I'm sure this place doesn't care about under pouring and overcharging as next week will bring the next wave of patrons, but there are PLENTY of better places to spend your time and money in this area of Vegas.",1
"Overall good, limited menu but good selection of beers. Service is good.",4
"Delicious food, drink are pricey.",5
What a fun place. Been here more than a few times. Nice place to hang out.,5
"Great tap selection, tasty apps as well",5
Great happy hour prices and delicious beer!,5
"Great atmosphere, music, sports and  lot of people. Great location but for this kind of place the food menu is really small.",4
"Beer Football Food Location Pation
Five Stars",5
Amazing place with terrific staff. Highly recommend,5
Friendly staff at a beer garden with good selections. Great for groups.,4
"Glorified Cafeteria.  Nothing at tables, utensils, condiments, menus . Ask for tip before food is served. Much better places nearby",1
Open area bar great sitting with friends for a drink. Nice atmosphere.,5
What a great place. Beer sports. All good stuff,5
"Great beer selection, awesome atmosphere and nice staff. Good games to play multiple jinga and it's in a great location.",5
Great IPA selection and Live Music was great!,5
Packed on home day. But awesome,5
Great craft beer taps and bottles. Best selection in Vegas!  Food is simple and handmade with quality local ingredients!  I'll be back!,5
Easily accomodated our group of 16!,5
Lively crowd! Great beer selection and people watching before a show/concert!!,5
The name says it all great choice of beers and happy hour makes it really affordable. The food was also very tasty.,5
Nice place to catch a game and have some drinks,5
"During hockey games, it's the best place to partake in ""pre-game"" libations and activities",5
Nice spot just not sure I agree with food being ordered separately.   The  waiters should handle it in my opinion.,4
"nice selection of brews and sweet outdoor, not to crowded spots",5
Love this place - excellent beer selection! Awesome patio seating on The Park. Nice that the patio doesn't face The Strip so the traffic noise isn't so loud.,5
$4 happy hour had good choices. I liked the atmosphere inside and outside.,5
Food was good but the drinks were terrible since we never got them. And I believe the beers we ordered were in bottles. Didn't have there sh_t together.  Rookies..had other places to visit ..,2
"Good food, good beer selection, and pleasant staff, but the prices are high  The happy hour special from 2 to 4 PM has only 4 beers, but the $4 price is nice.",3
Nice beer menu great for sporting events,5
"Fun games on the table,  great beer,  yummy food and terrific service!",5
Very expensive.  It is good food and beers. But the price shows why its always dead. Kinda a scam off the knights if you will.,2
Good atmosphere and you should try the jalapeno beer,5
"Food was great , prices were high, service was good",5
Great little waitress and great selection.,5
"Good sports bar, showing premier league football, Vegas prices though !!",4
"We stopped in for a beer before the Knights game, and it was slammed as one would expect. The beer list was solid with some rarities we can't get back in Ohio, but the service was beyond awful.

It's one thing to excuse bad service due to heavy bar traffic, but the bartenders were extremely preferential in serving the home team fans before me and my out of town buds. It was blatant and totally unprofessional.",2
The fries and cheese sauce was the best I have ever had in my whole life. Perfect!,5
Nice stop for a quick beer and sandwich. Very good selection of draft lagers and ales.,4
"Expected better taste and more quantity for the cost. Tri Tip sandwich,wings watered down lemonade o and fries. $42",2
Big open space. Outside area has tables & heat lamps ....area where u can play jenga with big blocks 😊,4
Great place to pre-game for a Knights game! Excellent beer choices.,5
Good place. Bartenders need to smile a bit. They might get a bigger tip that way.,5
"We went there for the impossible. We ordered 2, with some sides/appetizers, waited for them, got them at the table, staff left with no word spoken... but... It was not the impossible.
Went back to the cashier, she checked with the kitchen, and yes, it was not the impossible. They were out of stock and substituting it. It looks like the cashier hadn't  received the memo.
I understand many restaurants are struggling to get the product delivered, but they didn't handle it properly.
She told me it was still vegan, but a different brand.
The manager came and also tried briefly to talk me into buying the substitution. So, they are charging $15 for a burger, they name it after a specific brand, subtitute it without telling customers and then they try to talk them into eating it anyway. Kind of weird.
Imagine the same in a car dealer? ""I know this is not a Porsche, but it has four wheels!""
They gave me my money back, but it took unnecessarily long. When I came back to the table the appetizers were cold. We ordered the quinoa burger, wasn't great.
Local hefe beer a bit overpriced, $9.50 a small plastic cup, the is price not shown on the list at the cashier.
You would understand why I am not eager to come back.",1
"Located in the plaza leading to T-Mobile arena, the Beerhaus has a very open, social atmosphere. Sandwiches were tasty, fries were great!",5
Amazing beer selection. Great bar food. Love this place. First stop everytime we're in Vegas,5
"For the Strip, great value for money
Great beer selection.
Small selection of food, really good though
Good location & atmosphere",4
"Ambiance is second to none,  off the strip,  next to T Mobile Arena... come check it out, especially during a Golden Knights game!!!",5
"Lots of beers, menu varied and wait staff was very good even with being slammed after a Knights game",4
The food wasn't that great.  You need to order food at one area and then order a drink from another area.  If you order a drink from your table the service was super slow.  So it was disappointing!  😒,1
Beer and service is always great. Expensive so expect to pay.,4
$$$ But great burgers & brews,5
The live music is wonderful.  It's why we went inside.,5
Need more food on the menu and definitely more chairs,3

"Great staff to steer you toward a tasty beer (local or otherwise) at Beerhaus, and the cred to recommend beer and food elsewhere too. Food was very tasty too, good meat and veggie sandwiches.",5
Rip off. Two burgers two beers for 50$? And they do expect tip at a fast food like counter. Unbelievable,1
Super close to the VGK T-Mobile arena. Beer before a Knights game....yes please.,4

OMG find these guys when the are grilling outside!!  They were tending to the fire about an hour before sunset..brats and taps were...a m a z i n g...no fuss spot in LV is rare find.  Go and enjoy!!,5
Really nice trendy spot to hang out before the concert.,5
Great experience but the price is kind of high for the minimal amount of food.,4
"Ok, it's out the way of the madness a bit but the bar staff seem grumpy, probably don't like the tourists but if so don't work in Vegas. I paid $22 for a round and the guy never told me about happy hour. He made money on that round but overall lost out as I cleared off after I realised.",3
Nothing special. Reasonable food and prices.,3
"Fantastic bar welcoming staff, fun games big screens",5
I really like the food here. Plenty of games to play at the tables. A+,5

The beer is pretty good. Our bartender was awesome!,4
Rachel was absolutely  wonderful! She was hoping that they could offer a New England Clam Chowder in the near future!,5

"Great place to meet up with friends as it's mostly am outdoor seating place, sit chat watch the world go by and is warm all evening.",3
Best place in town to wash a golden night game. Food is amazing and the drinks are good 2...,5
"Fun for everyone. Cornhole games, jenga for free at the beerhaus. We were here for at least 2 hours. Happy hour for food and drinks everyday. I can only imagine how
fun it is when the V knights play. People are here for fun. They have outdoor and indoor seating. It's a beergarden, so make friends",5
Horrible service and food.  Ordered a beer and got the wrong one.  My husband ordered a brat and it was also wrong.  We were not asked once how our food was.  Will not be back.  Big disappointment!,1
"Had the fried chicken sandwich. it was good, but the chicken was burnt on the bottom.",3
"Drinks were great, atmosphere for games was fun and the jenga at the tables was a pretty good time",5
"Went for party in the park which is Tuesday with a live band with drinks offers of  $5 beer, wine and shots from 6pm. Every time I ordered I had to argue for a $5 wine. It was on a rotating advertisement on their tv screens so a couple of times the server made me wait until it came back around before they'd believe me about their own promotion. And once they conceded that there were $5 wines their attitude stank as if they'd been found out. One of them shortchanged me $2, it was just petty.  Ridiculous behaviour. Honour your promotions or don't run them!!!",1
"Good drinks, weird set up. Food and beer are separate. Vegan friendly options!!!",4
"Great beer variety, friendly & knowledgeable staff",5
"Local beer on tap, and happy hour specials that are pretty good.",3
Food was good service for drinks was slow.,3
"Not accommodating for easy things, you can't order food at table, which is not good for large groups, food is so so...need better food, better attitudes, and the ability to order from tables.",1
"Limited menu, but the food is excellent. A lot of great craft beer choices.",5
Great selection of local and not local beers. Lots of people from other locations hanging out watching games.,5
"Very fun place to go right next to T-mobile arena. They have a ping pong table, shuffleboard as well as connect 4 and Jenga on the tables. Good happy hour specials, certain beers and dogs and French fries with cheese/beer sauce, all 4 bucks from 2 to 6 pm everyday. We were afraid of the cheese sauce thinking it was the fake processed cheese. It was not and it was really good. We also got the hot link which was really good as well the put a lot of toppings on the dogs.

Beers were good and plentiful, try the grapefruit sculpin, it was terrific.",5
Fun place and great location!  Save some dough and try to go during happy hour,5
"This beer garden style restaurant just outside the arena is the perfect place to go for drinks before or after games or just any time when visiting LV. The beer selection is pretty good with a ton of craft brews on taps. The food is also pretty solid bar food though the menu is a little limited. The space is huge and a great place to also catch games on the tv. With a location that can't be beat right off the strip, it's a no brainer for beer.",4
Not a bad price for ribs and a big portion especially since it's on the strip.,5
This place is a lot of fun guys!!!! They have super good beers and lots of games!!!,5
$4 happy hour ;) Good selection of beer and food.,5
Great place I really loved the service and the kind of food is good. The beers are awesome.,5
Awesome place to take a break and have a drink... plenty of games to play and happy hour food was good,5
Their pretzels and beer cheese dip was delicious & drinks were awesome. When we went back to order again they took 25 mins for a simple one item order. I didn't like that at all. I went to the manager & asked about the hold up. He responded with a smart wiseacre answer & made us wait another 10 mins. If you like waiting extreme amounts of time for food then this is recommended. A+ food. HORRIBLE service.,2
"The strip is always a ripoff, but this is next-level. Don't waste your time with this place. The food is an overpriced joke, slow (almost nonexistent) service, no happy hour because it's a game night. Greedy much?",1
This place was solid!  Quick service BBQ at its finest.,4
Servers were fantastic. Food is great.,5
"Great food, awesome atmosphere.",5

Great selection of Beers. Friendly staff. Central location on the Strip.,5
"Friendly bartenders, fun board games. Slightly off the strip, which makes it more attractive to locals, but close enough to the strip that the drink prices are still pretty high.",4
"Slow service, we had a medium sized group. Had to flag down the server several times to order more beer. Place closed earlier because they were not busy. Didnt love it.",3
Big dog lager was great.  Munchies at the bar were delicious.,5
Fun place to go before a Knights game.,4
A very cool place to go and visit. What else can I say.,4

Go here and you'll quickly understand why it's dead on a Saturday afternoon...,2
"Ok, not the cheapest place, do table service  for drinks, good to watch sport",3
Great atmosphere. Expect higher prices on the strip.,4
A cool place but certainly not cheap.,4
Yummy fresh and hot food.,5
This place has over 60 craft beers if you love beer this is where you need to be,4
"The food was good, but nothing to write home about. I plan to visit again during an event where I hear the place gets crazy.",3
Great beer selection and excellent service. They have some of the coolest bar games I've ever seen.,5
"One of the worst places to eat. Ordered a pulled pork, which ended up being dry and disgusting. Plus, everything - alcohol included - was overpriced. I would not recommend this place to an enemy.",1
The brauts were excellent and a great beer selection. If only they had a Belgium triple or quad on tap.,4
"Fun atmosphere, relaxing good music, table tennis, jenga, foosball, etc.  Only drawback is happy hour menu options suck - only 4 beers are available at discount and they are not even interesting options. Will come back, we ordered out of the regular menu and we loved our beers!",5
"I was in there yesterday afternoon 2/11/19 at about 3:30/3:40pm with my boyfriend and my girlfriend I haven't seen in 19 years.  The waitress came to our table finally after being slumped over the bar talking with the bartender in the service section of the bar. She didn't introduce herself AT ALL. We all had questions about the beers on tap and she didn't know ANY BEER on the menu and kept saying ""I don't know"", ""I don't know"" to all of our questions about the beer on tap. She was not the friendliest waitress after I asked her about the beers on happy hour. She literally tossed the chalkboard on our table and didn't discuss with us anything on the happy hour menu.... My friend ordered a beer on the HH menu and she dropped it off and left quickly.... 8 minutes later my boyfriend wanted a beer on the HH menu and she said ""sorry its 4:08 and pointed to my friends beer and said she ordered it within the HH time"". and walked away!!!!!! SERIOUSLY??? My boyfriend and I would have ordered within the time frame of HH had this girl been anywhere on the floor. These are the type of waitresses you have serving beer to people and representing your establishment in LAS Vegas on the strip ??All I can say is WOW..... She needs to learn at LEAST what a Lager is and what a Pilsner is and what an Amber is and what a Heff is, if she wants to work SUCCESSFULLY at a beer bar. My friend asked her what kind of light beers do you have and she said to  her "" do you like blue moon!!?!!!"" lol Horrible...My friend didn't want that style of beer she wanted a light style beer otherwise my friend would have asked her ""what beer do you have that tastes like blue moon?"". She should also encourage HH, not discourage it because its cheaper. She will be the reason I probably will never go back. I'm a local  and I'm a waitress for the past 15 years- I had to do her job for her and help my friend order a beer.... I expect THE BEST when going to the strip NOT THE WORST. She needs to be talked to about what being in the CUSTOMER SERVICE industry entails . I left her a good tip ($7 on a $33 tab) ONLY because I am in the industry, she didn't even say thank you  or gave me her name. She needs to get talked to SERIOUSLY... this put a horrible taste in my mouth about going to your establishment, especially during hockey games and events at the T-mobile Arena!!!. I'll never return, neither will my boyfriend, and neither will my friend when she comes back to Las Vegas. Waitresses are representing your company and should know basic beer knowledge along with learning to smile while providing GREAT service no matter what. She was clueless!!",1

This isnt a brewry like one would expect. Their prices on beer aren't very good. Maybe thays because its in las Vegas.,3

The beer selection is ok. The smell was horrible on Thursday Jan 16. Drain issue?,2
Beautifully decorated Restaurant and Bar. The servers and bartenders are phenomenal. The people that handle the food especially Humberto which they do not wear name tags by the way so I had to ask. Work totally rude totally slow and we're making obscene comments to other employees in front of me and my children. Humberto must know somebody really high up to even have that job that was the most disgusting service I've ever had in front of my children I was embarrassed. They have also decided to cut back on the food and increase the prices. This could be the best beer bar in Vegas but it is horribly mismanaged. Nobody knows who is serving who. When we finally got our food it was cold and still and nothing like we had ordered before not that it mattered we really didn't want it after being treated like that by Humberto. Whatever you do do not bring your family here this is a redneck bar if you come to Vegas and go to this bar you are from Kentucky. I even saw the most beautiful innocent young lady gets smacked on the butt by a drunk customer and nothing was done I almost wanted to step in and punch the guy in the face myself. No one helped her one of the other servers came over so I thought management would take care of it they never did the customer stayed got more obnoxious and made it horrible for everybody staying there. I'm not sure there was a manager there for the hour almost we were there and that was only so the kids can play the games. Whatever you do do not come here for the food do not bring your children this will soon become one of Vegas is best ghetto beer spots. I've managed restaurants for 30 years and this is by far the worst I have ever seen managed. Every new bar and restaurant has Growing Pains but this was so far beyond that. We won't be coming here again as a matter fact when we go to T-Mobile Arena we will come from the other direction. Also if you talk to the other restaurant servers in their surrounding restaurants they will tell you that the beerhaus is a thorn in there butt basically. For those of you looking to get a great building for your restaurant and bar look for this place to be empty before the summer is over even if it is owned by MGM. The most disgusting display of what is supposed to be the most anticipated opening of the year. Good riddance and goodbye to this place forever,1
Good beers and band.,5
"Loved this place, so much fun",5
"The food options could be better. Drinks are decent but pricey, although that's to be expected.",3
Sitting inside and order a $10 beer and a 14$ drink and they serve them in a flimsy plastic cup! Not classy at all. If I’m paying those kinda prices I want a damn glass!,1
Great selection of local beers.,5
"As a Las Vegas local, I don't get out on the Strip much. I brought my family to the Beerhaus to surprise my dad with Rolling Stones tickets that were playing at the T Mobile Arena next door. The management and staff made his 60th birthday the best ever! We got a nice booth in front of the TV playing our baseball game. We received excellent service. Everyone was friendly and attentive to our needs. There's games to play at the table and outside. The beer selection was amazing!! Even the amount of beers on happy hour was great. The food tasted just as good as the beer. We ordered fries with beer cheese, delicious! Even better were the fried pickles...we had to order two more rounds after the first order. We also got the chicken dinner. It came with their ""haus salad"" that was so crispy and fresh. It had romaine lettuce, avocado, tomatoes. It was so yummy!
Needless to say, I will definitely be back! I don't get out much, especially somewhere that isn't near my house. With Uber and Lyft available, I can't wait to come back! I LOVE BEERHAUS!!!!!!!",5

"(Translated by Google) An incredible choice of beer, from local to imported ones. As for the kitchen, the choice is small but all in all good. The food is to be ordered at the entrance and is paid there while the drink is ordered at the table and you pay it separately.

(Original)
Una scelta incredibile di birra, da quelle locali a quelle d'importazione. Per quanto concerne la cucina la scelta è poca ma tutto sommato buona. Il cibo è da ordinare all'entrata e viene pagato li mentre il bere lo ordini al tavolo e lo paghi a parte.",3
"(Translated by Google) What a cool shop. In the immediate vicinity of the Telekom Arena, it is a must for ice hockey fans to stop here. The selection of beer (and of course other beverages) leaves nothing to be desired. We didn't eat anything but it looked very tasty at the neighboring tables. Our service was totally nice and we felt very comfortable.
A great extra are the games that you can borrow to make your stay even more fun.

(Original)
Was für ein cooler Laden. In unmittelbarer Nähe zur Telekom Arena ist es für Eishockey Fans ein Muss hier anzuhalten. Die Auswahl an Biersorte (Und natürlich auch anderen Getränken) lässt kaum Wünsche offen. Gegessen haben wir nichts jedoch sah es an den Nachbartischen sehr lecker aus. Unsere Bedienung war total nett uns wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt.
Nen tolles extra sind die Spiele die man sich ausleihen kann um sich den Aufenthalt noch lustiger zu gestalten.",5

"Walking into this restaurant there is a lot to see. The interior is nicely decorated with lots of ocean swag, there are all sorts of fish hanging and on the walls. There is a full size airplane hanging from the ceiling, there were several boats lined up and you could dine in a boat! Our server greeted us quickly, we ordered drinks, and they arrived shortly afterwards. I tried the Blackberry Moonshine Margarita drink which was fabulous! It took a bit of time to have our server come back around to order our food, we were pretty hungry by that point. It did not seem to be too extraordinarily busy, we were there on a Friday around 6pm, we dined as a party of 7 ladies. Our food we ordered was pretty tasty, I had the Fish Taco, they were amazing! The bill was quite a mess but in the end it all worked out.",4
"We started our sons 21st birthday celebration with lunch here and we very pleased with our choice! I can’t recall our servers name but she was awesome! (We were here 9/15, 12pm reservation, party of 6.) Food was outstanding and Margaritas were on point! We were here three years ago for our daughter’s 21st birthday and we were just as happy then! Keep up the good work, we’ll see you in 3 years for the next one’s 21st 😊",5
I wanted salmon but it was not on the menu so I had the fish tacos and coconut shrimp.  Both were  delicious!!  Drinks were perfect!   Service was good and the wait was only 15 minutes.,4
Food and staff were great. I've eaten here a couple of times and both times were great. Prices are reasonable for being directly on the strip. I highly recommend eating here. Such a great atmosphere also. Enjoy!!!,4
"We ordered the Appetizer Trio, a cheeseburger with fries & a Cuban with salad. Not impressed. Best thing on Trio was chicken & that isn’t saying much. My husbands cheeseburger seemed like a frozen patty we could grab at the grocery. The Cuban was good, but the salad was iceberg lettuce torn apart with some shredded carrots and a couple small cucumbers tossed on. And I wasn’t crazy about the ranch. It had a weird aftertaste. One of the more expensive meals we have shared in Vegas & our least favorite for sure. After talking to some friends, found out they had the same opinion. Drinks maybe, skip the food.",2
"The perfect margarita was too strong for a lightweight like me, but they were so nice to help me lighten it up.",5
Great experience if you've never been. Food is good atmosphere is even better.  Service was attentive and always coming around to make sure your taken care of for drinks.,5
Wife loved the Garlic Bacon Burger with gluten free bun! Sampler platter and specifically spinach artichoke dip was fantastic. No live music while we were there. Decor is awesome.,4
For the price the seafood combo featured in my pics was amazing.  It looks like microwaved shrimp but it's actually very crispy and tasty. The fish was pretty good for not looking appealing. It was surprisingly filling also!  Great little themed restaurant. Didn't try the drinks though,5
Club was great taco salad was also great service at the bar excellent guys . Happy hour appetizers and prices good,5
"Service was exceptional. Most of the food options are fried, not much variety in healthier options but we enjoyed talking with our server and drinks instead. The chicken egg roll appetizers were NOT typical for this chain. They were filled with a flavorless, dry ground chicken vs the typical spicy chopped chicken, beans, corn mix.",4
"Had a great time eating here right off the strip. Food was amazing, and happy hour all day! The house margaritas was very well made. Had the nachos and seafood combo plate. Would highly recommend for a good place right off the strip",5
The 2 guys at the bar were great the happy hour food awesome had a taco salad and club both great way to much food,5
Right on the strip. Easy access. Moderately priced. Good food and unique atmosphere.,5
Burgers were delicious cooked the way you want them the waitress was really awesome my husband ordered some type of coconut dip for his onion rings all they had run out she mixed ranch dip with some other ingredient and it was delicious da bomb great food great waitress,5
Good food and good service. Drinks amazing!!,4
"The concept is fantastic, who doesn’t love a little Jimmy Buffett here and again? But I think COVID has taken some of the spark out of this location (maybe Vegas in general). Margaritas are the best in town, as they should be with a name like “Margaritaville”. But the restaurant was a bit sad. The same 10 songs on repeat, grumpy bartenders, kitchen making mistakes on our food. I’d still go back, because I’m a fan, but hopefully someday this location is restored to its former glory and vibe.",4
Great atmosphere. Good food. Service was friendly,5
"Worst meal I had while in Vegas. I got the Cuban. The meat was ice cold and my fries where cooked yesterday. My wife's salad  was old, you can't get anything grilled. Everything is fried or deep fried",1
"Called in for drinks, but the food going past convinced us to eat there another night. Really excellent and not too expensive. Waiter called Ryan was particularly friendly and attentive. Came over just to say hi and fist bump on our second visit. Friendly staff make for great atmosphere!",5
"We ate here twice while staying at The Flamingo. Service was exceptional both times. Happy Hour house margarita was good size, and great tasting. We shared the Volcano Nachos. They were very good and plentiful. $7 house margarita; $5 draft beer happy hour all day long.",5
First Margaritaville I've been to. Sit where ever you want. Live bands when. Jimmy's buffet music or songs he likes isn't playing. Friendly staff. And the food great price and delicious.,5
"Out with a group for dinner.  We were seated quickly.  Come for the atmosphere.
Large portions good food.",4
"Everyone was very friendly.  Our waitor Jared was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We had the wings with the sauce on the side. The wings were delicious, cooked perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I hadr the coconut shrimp with fries.  The coconut shrimp was freshly made (as in it was cooked and brought to the table immediately). I had a perfect margarita and a mango something margarita.  Both were really good, the perfect is strong but not too strong.",5
"The coconut fried shrimp 🍤🍤🍤came with 2 sauces, coconut ranch sauce & aprcot horseradish sauce, and they were AMAZING! Plenty of food and great atmosphere with a virtual projection volcano that turned into lush green trees and other different scenes that made you feel like you were on the beach! Great margaritas and drinks!! 🍹🧉🍻 Beautiful tables, bar and very friendly staff that did an excellent job keeping up with what you needed! Loved it! 💛🐝💛",5
"The chicken sandwich and tenders were surprisingly good. Cold beer and margarita's,  what more can you ask for?",5
"Wow, what a fun place to eat!! Everything was delicious from the egg rolls, to the chicken tenders and jambalaya, to the delicious key lime pie!!! The perfect margarita was too strong for a lightweight like me, but they were so nice to help me lighten it up. The restaurant has a cool fake volcano and awesome party music playing, just all around a great place with super nice and helpful staff!! Definitely recommend!!!",5
Service was great! Food was amazing! Food worth the price. Good atmosphere.,5
Absolutely loved the experience! Great food and the 24 hour Happy Hour special was Fantastic! The frozen House Margaritas made with the Margaritaville tequila was on point ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,5
Went her for lunch while in town for my birthday .The service was really good and the wait wasn't bad at all.Just wish they had more to choose from.What I got was really good.My waitress was super good.I thought the picture part was an amazing touch.Got one of the pics and left very happy.,4
Friendly staff. Our food came out quickly. Delicious 😋,5
"It is over-rated! Had one of the ""top-shelf"" margaritas that was full of ice and no alcohol, served in a plastic cup... Service was good, but food and drinks were not what I expected.",3
"If you’re looking for good food and margaritas this is NOT the place for you! The tequila in the margaritas isn’t 100% agave. When I asked for an upgrade to real tequila, the waitress was confused. This should be a fairly standard request, especially at a place called “margaritaville”. Serving the drinks in a plastic cup is fine if you’re at a pool bar, but not ok if you’re indoors at an adult restaurant. The food was adequate. Have a look at the picture of my southwest chicken salad. There’s supposed to be corn, peppers, cheese, and other fun fiesta ingredients - not the case. The chicken was dry and obviously pre-cooked.

I don’t take these reviews lightly; the restaurant business is difficult enough, even without a global pandemic. But, customers looking for good food and drinks need to know there are much better options in the vicinity.",1
Started out with the nachos. It’s a must have.  I love that they serve landshark on tap.  I got the fried chicken sandwich and the waitress suggested tossing it in buffalo wing sauce for some kick.   It was really good.  Great atmosphere and the people are so nice.  Everyone should eat here once while on the strip.,5
"Be aware of them adding money to your tip.

Also in no way is this place deserving of being called Margaritaville. Come here if you want poorly flavored drinks and food that a fast food establishment can make better.",1
The piña colada’s were wonderful. The fried pickles were yummy coconut ship was great. We’re definitely return. The best part is probably the atmosphere and ambience.,5
"Food came fast, service was great and it was easy to get into. Kids meals were good and a large selection for the adults..",5
Good service. Fish-N-Chips and Chicken Southwestern Eggrolls. Eggrolls hint of spice. Excellent choice.,5
Plastic cups. A lot of fried food but nice place. Good for a drink and an app.,3
Very laid back. Great service and definitely Jimmy Buffett vibes,5
Surprisingly good breakfast options right on the Strip at the entrance to the Linq promenade! Generous portions and prices are average for dining on the Strip.,5
Great sea food the shrimp excellent and I saw some of the other sea food like fish tacos and what not but I ordered a burger like a dummy and the burgers here are garbage no good at all. Dry no flavor nothing if u come here EAT SEAFOOD ONLY,4
"Always try and make it there, every time we're in town. Always meet new friends every time 🍹.Always a great time 😎👍",5
Great club sandwich and drinks!  The artichoke dip was ok.,4
"It was a great place to stop and grab a bite to eat. Since we live here locally,  we bring the tourists here.",5
"Food was Delicious. I had the Turkey Club, the pickles are amazing 🤤 I wish we had better service most of the waitresses had attitudes when we asked for utensils. They also included the tip to our total. No wonder service is Bad, since they know they’re getting a tip regardless.",5
Good drinks for a decent price! I would recommend for some snacks and drinks.,5
Loved the drinks and the molten cake!,5
Good food & good service!,5
"Good food, service and a roaming magician that was funny and had some good tricks.",5
"Love this place!  The bartenders were super friendly and made my night by giving me a fun glass to put my margarita in (I can't stand when margaritas don't come in fun margarita glasses!).

The only disappointing thing were the hours...They closed so early each night and it was very odd.  We're in Vegas on the weekend and by 11PM could not get into margaritaville and that made a lot of our group very sad.

I didn't catch our bartenders name but whoever was serving on 12/10 at the end of night in a red jersey made our night and a large part of the trip with how fun and nice he was!  Thanks guys!",5
"The place is fun, the guys at the bar are awesome!
Service is super fast.
Drinks are great!
Good prices for the strip.",5
"Always fun. Great staff, great food. Love the chicken nachos and coconut shrimp!",5
Awesome drinks and food!  Great atmosphere to just sit and chill!@,5
"Been in about three of them.
Not bad, Jimmy never comes out for a drink though!",3
"My wife (Amanda) and I LOVE this place!  Food was great and the atmosphere was perfect. We found our new favorite Bartender (Dani)!!!! She is amazing and such a great person. We are definitely going to miss her. If she’s ever in Colorado, she needs to look us up.",5
"I had the egg rolls and the spinach dip... My egg rolls weren't hot when I got them like they had been sitting out and my spinach dip taste like it was freezer burnt... on the positive note, the waiter was friendly and attentive which boost my rating to 3 stars...",3
The bartenders are amazing!! They are so attentive and personable. The food is also great. Try the lava lava shrimp it is delicious!,5
Great food. Great service.  Great drinks,5
"Appetizer platter, filling.  Their signature margarita drinks, Excellent. (But not on their all day happy hour menu)",5
Fun experience. Pretty decent food,4
Good food good service good live music during our dinner.,5
Great place to eat especially the key lime pie 🥧,5
Amazing drinks like A1 drinks.  Good food but the customer service was more than expected it's was amazing great.   Go see waiter Chris he cool,5
Huge restaurant with an eye opening interior design. The food was better than expected and the servers do a great job each time I visit this location!,5
"The food was delicious,  the frozen Margarita 🍹 was also delicious",5
"The food was good .The photographer was good, but my waitress was rude. Her name was Pamela . I felt like I was borthing her she never came to check on my table  and the restaurant wasn't even busy, she was having a side conversation with her co worker, and she was rushing us to order and This was my 1st time there and its a major attraction ,the service could of been way better.",2
"Always a fun restaurant in terms of decor, but the food is mostly your basic fare. The food has improved since the last time we came at least, and the service was good. The drinks are $12, but they are strong 😊",4
"I had chicken tenders that were not very good, wife had chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries that were good. The drink “Five o’clock somewhere” was really good.",3
Great food! Excellent service.,5
Food and drinks were good. Service was just ok.,4
"Great food, chill vibes, and a fun volcano erupting plus screens that drop down for views of past live performances. The chicken tenders were so good!",5
"Delicious food and staff are amazing.
Look forward to coming back.",5
This place is OK. The one in Arizona is much better. The food was skimpy but service was great.,3
Only thing good was the margarita which was very small.  Food deliverer accidentally knocked food off the plate and it went all over the table.  She apologized but left the food as if we were going to eat it off the table.  I don't like paying $50 for 2 people and then leave hungry. I only had one margarita.  The manager took a few dollars off but we didn't eat anything.,1
Excellent Margaritas at reasonable prices.,5
"Awesome meal once again !!  Our server on 11-27-2021 was Adam , and he was a fantastic guy. Attentive, and very personable .
Service was stellar as always at Margaritaville. That's why I always have to stop in when I vacation, because I set them up so I'm always close to one!

Jimmy Buffett Forever!!!    ParrotHeads Rule the 🌎🏝️🏖️!!!",5
Nothing special really.  Food was ok.  My server Maria was awesome though.,3
Their menu was just above a frozen menu from Long John Silver.  Being solicited for photo shots for another way of taking your money. They have no real backgrounds to make the photo real so they photoshop you in one. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for the very friendly waitress. Cudos for her training. I hope all of them are like her. Will never even get close to this one again and may never even look into eating or visiting any other one until changes are made to the vibe and menu. I love fish and appreciate a variety plus Calamari and scallops in any seafood menu. NOT HERE.😪 You have the name recognition now make these changes and become a leader in food quality as well.,2
"Came for dinner to Margaritaville last week with my son.  We were seated by the musician area, and it was pretty busy.
The waitress came over relatively soon and took our drink order and they came shortly.  Margaritas were very good.  We ordered the Nachos which were big and delicious.  Also the Lava Shrimp, which were lightly breaded with a chipotle? sauce that had a kick to it.  Yum.
Great experience and we will definitely be back.",5
Enjoyed the atmosphere. My food did not taste the best. The Landshark Fish and Chips were not good quality.,3
"The atmosphere was entertaining, the food was not that good and expensive. I think we were paying for the atmosphere.",4
"Food was excellent, but for being on the Vegas strip, they should be open WAY later. House margarita is better than the perfect one and way cheaper too. The girl working in the gift shop could have been friendlier. She seemed in a rush to be done with you… almost robotic.",5
"Definitely as nice place to go with or without a family! The atmosphere is very unique and fun, a photographer takes pictures at your table that you can buy, and the staff are extremely nice. The location is perfect right across from Ceasars Palace and next to it there is a cool outlet to shop after or before. The drinks are 10/10 for sure and the 4 stars is because if you are looking for AMAZING food in Vegas, this isn't it. Good for sure but nothing special. Other than that, I highly recommend!",4
Tried to get into restaurant …45-50 minute wait. Plenty of empty tables… not sure what was up. Referred us to bar. Great service at the bar. Shrimp appetizer was great. Still looking for the perfect crispy chicken sandwich - this one was good. Fish tacos were deep fried. Not wife’s favorite but I enjoyed them. 😉😂 Atmosphere was totally lacking… could’ve been anywhere… Margaritavile was all about atmosphere and entertainment in previous visits. Different times are impacting I’m sure..,3
Great bartender at the back. Large portions.,5
Great service and fast great prices probably the cheapest I seen here,5
Just had outside cocktails. Top notch,5
Very nice restaurant!! We actually for a free picture keychain. The food was great and came out in a decent time. The waiter was amazing!!,5
"Phenomenal drinks with seemingly endless options as well as a vast selection of food. I could sit here, drink, snack and people watch all day.",5
I only had the Lime in Da Coconut drink which was so refreshing and delicious. I'm going to try to replicate it at home. My friend enjoyed her strawberry margherita but her salad for her meal which was pricey andhad brown lettuce. My other companion had the taco salad which he said was OK. The ambiance receives 5 stars but the food was meh.,3
I went to Margaritaville with my daughters and godson we went to go have dinner we wanted some of their chicken wings they were really good and we had a couple of drinks they drinks are great as well!,5
"Sorry but over priced,  food was less than what I'd say was average expectations",3
"We had great time here, good food good service",5
Fun place for a casual lunch or dinner. Its always 5 o'clock in Margaritaville,4
Met up with a girlfriend I hadn't seen in over 20years. Atmosphere nice music nice and food delicious 😋,5
"Great nachos, lively atmosphere and fun decor!

Pros: Lively atmosphere, fun beach-themed decor, friendly customer service, delicious nachos.

Cons: Some of the food items on the menu were a little expensive and average at best.

Margaritaville is the place to get amazing nachos that can be shared by many people. However, some of the other food items were a bit on the average side and was lacking. One of our friends ordered the Jambalaya and it looked very rushed and the portion size was small. In a way, the quality of the dishes varied to delicious to so-so.

I would only recommend Margaritaville for those looking for delicious nachos, variety of drinks, and a fun beach-themed atmosphere. Other than that, there are other places on the strip that may provide more bang for your buck when it comes to food.",3
"This place is amazing! Food was on top! Had the lava shrimp and fish tacos, nachos! Flavor was delicious! I would definitely recommend this place!",5
"Good entertainment, food and drinks.",4
Place looks amazingly good 👍,4
"Loved the place but wouldn't pay for the tee-shirt.
Definitely for us tourists.  In fact, skip this joint or just come for one drink and selfies. Difficult parking, which is at the Flamingo. I couldn't break the code and parked at another casino ( had tickets to a show) and took a taxi.",4
One of my fave places in Vegas! Reasonably priced margs and great service! Clarissa was a wonderful server and we had a great time!,5
"Servers and hostess staff are pretty low key. Food is simple and unfussy with good size portions. Prices are just a little less than the hotel buffet, but the buffet provides a wider selection with beverages included. Coffee was 3.99 and I didn't get refills as I would've liked. Food was good, but nothing remarkable.",3
"The staff made the experience something to remember, so please thank them for me!

Our server was very attentive to our drink orders as well as checking in here and there, making sure we were taken cared of.

The lava lava shrimp was bomb! That sauce with it 👌👌👌

An overall awesome experience seeing the boats as a place to sit and ship that's in the restaurant.",5
"We never miss margaritas at margaritaville when in Vegas. The perfect margaritas ate great and reasonable by Vegas standards. We love to sit at the bar and watch the Vegas sights. Full disclosure- we drink here, we don't eat here.",5
Food is good ....service was ok....prices are stupid high. I knew this already and still get dumbfounded when I go. Prolly my fault I know.,3
Great food! Great atmosphere!,5
"food was good. nothing like it used to be before Covid issues.
Employees were very friendly",4
"My daughter really wanted to come here, I'm glad I did we had a great waitress and we're seated promptly",5
"The food, service and margarita vibe was all wonderful~ Best part of this place is the amount of work they put into the decorations. Crazy nice~",4
Really nice laid back music. S lot of food for the money. I don't drink I only had water.,5
"Overpriced. The kids got 20 dollar craft mac and cheese and processed, nasty lunch meat on the club sandwich. The only good thing was the decor.",2
"Great place to get drinks and food, though the look of the restaurant has changed drastically since being purchased by another Owner.",4
Food eas delicious & service was on point. Social distance is awesome & sanitization is awesome.,5
"Had a really fun time in here singing along with my family for my birthday. The staff was so nice and the food was great. Our family shared a nacho, which is huge and so tasty, and then I also had a chicken cesar salad. The margaritas are decently priced and very flavorful. Happy hour all day every day, baby! I would definitely recommend Margaritaville to others!",5
Went for breakfast that was really good. And good service.,5
"I finally got to go, and it was totally worth it!

I've seen this place at other locations I've traveled to, but this is the first time I got ti go to any of them.

The style is awesome, they really go all out on the decor. The food was great for all of us. The mixed drinks were excellent.

The only thing I didn't like was their Perfect Margarita. It was strong, I'll give it that, but not tasty. Unless you just want a glass of nearly straight Tequila, try something else on the menu.",5
"Tbh. Pretty lack luster exp. The coconut shrimp should be served strictly on the dessert menu. The popcorn shrimp was average which made it the best food there. The ""fish and chips"" were just  soggy fish sticks. Finally my wife got a chicken salad. She said the taco bell power bowl was better which means a lot considering she hates taco bell. Staff were nice. Don't recommend this place if you're hungry.  Just eat anywhere else.",2
"The experience was ok, sat st tge table for a while before getting greeted. My fish and chips was ok tested kike it was previously frozen and not made fresh. Server was attentive, the show was good, wanted to sit outside but was yold it was for drinks only???",3
Love this place.  Nachos are worth the purchase and the new garlic bacon cheeseburger is delicious.  Great food at an average price.  The drinks were good too.,5
It's a $30.00 hamburger. But it's the best I've ever had. And I keep coming back.,5
For being one of the richest musicians restaurants it was by far the least impressive and one of the lowest points to our visit. Tried delivering breakfast that was a no go and then tried to order a substitute only to have our waitress come back soon after to tell me they do not have what ordered. Very disappointing.,1
Had breakfast and dinner here the food is a large portion and the price is fair. Great friendly service. Definitely recommend this place.,5
"Always a crowd favorite. Generous food portions with an atmosphere to match. We visit each time we come to Las Vegas, NV.",5
"I went twice during my stay a few weeks ago. First time was dinner after settling in. I had the chicken tenders. They were okay.  I would have preferred them crunchier but it's like a tempura batter. Some bites were a little tough too. The drinks were good though. Second time was breakfast. The Key West omelette, minus the avocado, was delicious! It was a lot of food too!",5
"I came back again to Vegas a couple months later after quarantine sooo long I couldn't take it!!  I had my favorite fish tacos they were soooo bomb!! And a Margarita!!! I love this place so much I got cravings for it afterword!!!  I told the bartender that I came all the way from LA because this is seriously one of my favorite places here!!!
I came to margaritaville when I was in Vegas about maybe a month ago!!  The food was sooo good!!!  I'm actually still thinking about it!!!  I had a margarita 🍹 both nights here since I was craving a drink!!  I also had the fish tacos 🌮 sooo good and the most giant pretzel!!!  I'll come back here when I come to Vegas.  There are so many places to eat but this was a great spot and loved it was open!!
This is still one of my favorite places.  I recently today had the South West chicken salad and fish n chips and it was really good especially the salad!! I didn't know what I wanted tonight but really glad I got the salad!!!",5
Food was very good.,4
Excellent food and excellent service!  Highly recommended!,5
Been here 4 times on 4 seperate vacations never been dissapointed once. Atmosphere is perfect food is delicious and margaritas are solid. 10/10,5
Was a great experience!! Especially when Jimmy buffet plays on the projector screen.,5
"So margaritaville was really good food, the place is a little loud at times but most of the time there was acoustic guitarist playing on a little stage. I was happy with our service and the server actually gave us some recommendations on things to see in the area. This restaurant is on the strip so it is easy to swing in and grab some food. My wife and i both liked it.",5
Louisiana cajun shrimp and grits is delicious! The portion size is definitely not worth $21 to me at all. I was still hungry but all in all the flavor was good.,4
Had a few drinks there service was good with a good acoustic performer I enjoyed it,4
Bar service is great. The spinach dip that is on the happy hour menu taste like BAKING SODA. I see why it’s so cheap.  I’ve had better frozen dips.,3
"HUGE plate of Nachos. They were good, but have had better. Asked for salsa, was charged $3.99 for it, & it definitely wasn't worth the 4 bucks. Very clean, super nice staff. Waiter made our day.",4
"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit. Liked the food, beer, and staff.",5
Great awesome wonderful place its my favorite and can't wait to get back. They have fast friendly service. Margaritas are awesome!! Recommend place to get one,5
Appetizers and drinks were great!  Friendly service and all day happy hour!,5
Good tasting food with good beverages! Highly recommend!,5
"This place is so much fun to go to. Everytime I'm in Vegas, I make it a point to go here for either lunch or dinner. My husband and I had our wedding reception here 15 years ago. My favorites are Cheeseburger in Paradise, Coconut Shrimp and of course, The Last Mango in Paris Margarita. The nachos are pretty good also, but HUGE!! I've heard that sometimes Jimmy shows up in his restaurants for impromptu concerts, I wish he would do this when I'm there having dinner! I've been to the one at Universal Studios Hollywood and that one is just as good! A really fun place to go when you are near one of their many locations! Great food, great drinks, fun people and just great ..period! I would recommend this place to anyone, whether you're a parrothead or not. 🦜",5
"Started with a pretzel and cheese dip, then enjoyed the coconut shrimp!!",5
"Low key atmosphere, good food.  I had the Lava Lava Thai Chicken.  Excellent.",5
"We ate here twice during our stay at the Flamingo. Excellent food, service, and entertainment! Highly recommend! I can't wait to go back!",5
Taco salad wasn't good but egg rolls were good.,3
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! THE FOOD IS BOMB AND THE DRINKS ARE STRONG!!!!,5
"Meh, the margarita was way too sweet, even the top shelf one.",3
Great drinks and amazing food!!! The gift shop is also hands down my favorite store on the strip.,5
"Large table was ready for family dinner. The waitress did well getting everything we all asked for. The food was better than expected.  :) oh yeah, the best fried pickles ive ever had.",5
"The plates are pretty big for what you order.
Fish tacos and Quesadilla. Classic margarita was okay. Good thing is you can take drinks togo! Other than that good experience.",5
Great atmosphere! Staff was very friendly and helpful,5
Seafood mac and cheese  it was good but needs more Seafood  we only seen the waiter at the beginning and the end,4
"Great music, beverages, food and service.  The atmosphere is great and live music to boot! Stopped in today for a quick meal, Jambalaya! It was perfectly prepared, loaded with seafood, veggies, and meat. Savory and spicy.",5
Yummy food.  Great vibe.  Love the cheeseburgers and key lime pie.,5
Luv the place. Drinks are great. Like watching the Jimmy buffet  concert tours.,5
"Staff is friendly, food was good, I will definitely make a return visit next time I’m in Vegas. If you want some tasty tacos and fabulous margaritas make a pit stop!",4
"Loved the booth (it was part of a boat) we sat in. The food was ok, we love Jimmy Buffett, so it was fun to do as we visited with friends that came into town and stayed at the Flamingo. The atmosphere with live music was nice, except it was so loud we could barely hear each other talk. All in all we had fun here though.",3
"Tasty food, good music, and great staff. I recommend the nachos!",5
Wonderful service wonderful food great atmosphere you'll think you're somewhere shipwreck we all went out on the town I believe they stop serving after 11 p.m.,5
"We have a lot of fun, good margaritas!!!!",5
"We've visited Margaritaville over a dozen times in the last twenty years, but I think we're done.
There used to be a party atmosphere in the restaurant, but all those elements have been cut. The dancer that appeared once an hour? Gone, along with the set she used to use. Likewise the stilt-walkers, who our waiter said were also gone for good.
What's left? Mediocre pub food and an aging restaurant that shows grainy music videos from the 70's. (I ordered fish and chips, which I would guess went straight from the freezer to the fryer to my plate.)
Sure, they serve margaritas, but so does literally every other restaurant on the strip. Go to one of those instead.",1
It was okay the food could have been a little bit better nachos with excellent my best friend had a Bahama Mama with a nice buttermilk chicken sandwich,3
The best chicken and waffles I ever had! I ordered the honey mustard and syrup on on the side rather than on top because I like to dip my foods. I got a hot chocolate as well and it came without whipped cream. When I asked for whipped to be added they did it without hesitation and it was so good! The ranch with my chicken tenders was delicious and I’m very picky on my ranches.. and the waffles were good with whipped cream as well. My only complaint it that I only got three little chicken tenders with my chicken and waffles.. and the fruit bowl was so small.. We also asked our waitress to change the channel so we could watch a certain game and she didn’t stop till she found the channel! Great service!,4
Food was great and service was too.  Ambiance was incredible.,4
"Well, I give this place 3 stars because of same chicken kabob. Rice on the side was too salty and chicken was too salty too . I didn't like it. We took New York stake as well - it was good (nothing special). Cocktail ""5 o'clock anywhere "" - wow, very alcoholic, great 👍🏻 job ! House salad - look at this - cabbage a big piece , have not been eaten. Atmosphere is nice",3
The only thing I ate and I got food poisoning hours later and also happend to my grandma few years back same place I do not recommend it I got the lava lava shrimp and there jambalaya I'm pritty sure the shrimp made me sick,1
"Always love Margaritaville. My date loves banana flavored cocktails. There is one place we know we can always get a banana cocktail...that's right the pros at Margaritaville always hook it up no matter what city we visit. Awesome service, great food, fun times. Worth every penny",4
Great food and service! Exceptional treatment from our waitress Julie H. Would definitely recommend for decent food at reasonable prices. The decor and ambience is pretty cool too!,5
A bit hard to find but a neat experience,4
Great respite from the heat! Yummy Club sandwich and watermelon wave drink! Excellent service.,5
Great Service and of Course Jimmy would be Proud of the Drinks and Food.Glad We stop by!!!!,5
"Nice place! We went during breakfast and got way more food than we thought we would. Good bang for your buck kind of place, especially on the strip. Highly recommend!",5
"Good food, good prices excellent service",5
"Great food and service. It was busy but we sat at bar without waiting more than 5 minutes and the servers/bartenders were awesome!!  Fun atmosphere, yummy drinks.",5
Great atmosphere food was delicious,5
"Questionable hostesses. Had to find seating on our own. When settled in (after debating whether or not to stay), service, food & drinks were good.",3
Wait time was less than 20 mins for Breakfast. The omelette was good. The hash brown that comes with the meal is crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. Our waiter was very attentive to our needs.,4
Great staff Great food . Good time,5
"We have visited Margaritaville locations all over the United States and have been to this location many times over the years.

The menu is excellent, and the 'Feature' at this location is first class!

As with these theme restaurants you pay more for the atmosphere than the food, so as you would expect its a somewhat pricey dining proposition.

This location gets VERY busy, so you may have to wait quite a long time at peak times.",4
"Fun place to go eat. The initial greeter was kinda rude, but the server was great. The food was good. There was no wait to be seated around 11am.",4
Not ready for prime time.  Lines were incredibly long to check in on a Monday and no more vip check in.  Although promised never got any housekeeping.  Had to track down towels and was only given one.  All the extensions on in in room phone were wrong,3
"Food was good, however the entertainment of the guitar player, singer was terrible.  Also the mermaid going down the slide into the glass was no longer there, nor was the person on stilts doing the balloons.  Very disappointing as we took friends ther and really talked it up.  So again very disappointing, may not go back.",2
"Good margaritas, the perfect is nice and clean, a little expensive, but it's Vegas. House margaritas is pretty good as well. Not too sweet and not super acidic.",4
Best burger I've ever had would recommend to anyone who's loves them.,5
"Such a great atmosphere with great service! Food and drinks were delicious, which is a huge plus! You HAVE to try their margaritas!!!! It's the best one I've ever had!! No joke! Waiter wasn't messing around!",5
Amazing place and food was good. And you can have anything put in the blender cup.,5
Amazing restaurant so beautiful on the inside. The food was amazing. We had bunch😋,5
Great food and fun atmosphere (its just like all the Jimmy Buffett chains),5
Good food/Hot great service,5
"The drinks were good- I had a Rum Runner and a Tsunami, but the fish and chips were bad (fish was dry and dense/overdone) and the quesadillas-also overcooked, and the SW Chicken Salad had chicken parts that were still undercooked or red. Not going here again.",1
"Second time to this location. The first time was much better, food and drinks were a little disappointing this round. The fried pickles didn't have much flavor and the chicken tenders were mushy inside, like frozen tenders",3
It was Vegas...I have no complaints lol. I spent 3 very fun days in Vegas. And then came home on the bumpiest flight ever! Not a good combination when you've had too many margaritas in an oversized container the night before🙄😅Anyways..nice place👍,5
Love the food here. Nachos are amazing and love the vibe in the place. Service was good.,5
"Good food, good service. Your average Margaritaville experience. They have a great show with a volcano and music.",5
Pricey. Very average meal quality and I generally eat anything put in front of me. Wait staff very cordial and professional but disappointing experience overall.,1
"Best dinner we had in Vegas the whole week! The food was great, the margaritas were awesome and very affordable, and we loved the music and the atmosphere overall in the restaurant. My boyfriend is not a fan of sugary drinks and he loved his margaritas. Our waiter was also so nice and the food came out fast! We had a really hard time finding out what time they were open until though. The website said 9 pm, but on the phone we were told midnight, and then 2 am from another place. Turns out they are open until around 10 pm, but occasionally stay later if a table or two is still there!",5
Happy hour is great!  The bartenders are very attentive too!,5
I love this place,5
"This place was better than i expected as i am not a Buffet fan.  The Key West omelet is amazing!! And you definitely have to try the featured Bloody Mary!! The service was a bit slow, but a cool environment, and great food.",5
"Its a nice place, good to hang! Decent food.
But the prices... dayummmm
Where are my booze deals?!
I might come again for the shrimps.",4
Not a bad happy hour spot just went for drinks place could use a little maintenance but overall nice experience and friendly staff.,4
Loved the nachos,5
Nice place. Pretzel was delicious.,4
"If you have a large group it can be a bit pricey. Food is marginal at best, drinks are where they really shine.",3
Katie was the bomb awesome server.,4
"One of my favorite ""go-to"" spots on the strip for cocktails & good food.  The service is always great.  Reasonable prices, great portions & live entertainment on some nights.",5
"Amazing and tasty food, definitely worth the overall wait .",5
"Very good,food the best, cost slot, threedrinks foo CD 60.67, handburge french fry and three taco and bean and rice",5
Jon Choy - coolest bartender in the world.,5
"Food, service and atmosphere was great.  I had a good time.",5
"The food is good, drinks and service is good. The waitress Jodi was amazingly sweet.",5
Great service. Cold Bud Light.,5
Always a good time. Good amount of seating on the rooftop bar. Bags game out and great view of the strip. Bucket O beers 5 for 21 and change so not bad (domestic mix/match),4
Drinks are great strong and good music,5
Yummy.  Quick seating. Quick service. Delicious food,5
Great food and drinks.  If you can't have fun here then you should go home,5
"Great service. Very attentive. i’m almost positive our waiters name was Victor. He was great!

I got the 45oz Blender Cup of the Mango Margarita they have. One of the best margs i’ve ever had!

The guy on the stilts was pretty cool too. he was making balloons for kids!",5
Fun environment and has varities in menu. Burgers sre huge and tasty but fries are barely average.,4
Very disappointed in the food quality. I paid way too much to be dissatisfied.,2
Food was delicious! Highly recommend! Great atmosphere!,5
The food and drinks were delicious. I enjoyed trying the fried pickles,5
"Good food, live music, friendly staff.",5
"The volcano nachos, are absolutely amazing, and HUGE! Hubby and I shared, and still didn't finish them.",5
Crowded but bartenders were quick to take our drink order and my frozen margarita was very good.,4
Had breakfast griddle combo and it was good. Service was very friendly except the hostess. I would recommend it for fast service and pretty good breakfast.,3
Omg this place was so amazing 👏 👌🏾👍🏾🤪,5
Great lunch on the strip in Vegas,5
So fun plus you get your pictures taken,5
Freddy was an awesome waiter! Had a great time!,5
Live music was fun. Food was good and service was awesome!,4
Margaritas were delicious and Danielle is probably the nicest/best bartender I’ve ever met,5
"Very clean, good menu, nice music… And happy hour all day every day!",5
"We forgot our bag at the restaurant and when we went back the manager said it was in the office. She came back and said that apparently it went missing. She refused to walkie any of her employees and ask if anyone moved it. She said they would call if they found it but that was all she could
do. She said it disappeared but she mentioned the contents of the bag that we never mentioned to anybody. When we asked how she knew what was in the bag she tried to say that we told her and when we said no she then followed and said “oh well um you must’ve told your waiter what was in it then”.  It was quite clear that she in fact had our bag and lied to us about it. Terrible experience",1
I wouldn't return to this estashinliment again the food was subpoena. Customer service was excellent. Drinks were good,3
"It's 5 o'clock somewhere! The food was great, the margaritas were awesome!!!",5
Great food and drinks and the servers are really nice and always checking if we needed anything else to eat or drink,5
Is awesome nice delicious good vive the drinks lo maximo,5
Always a fun place regardless if you're at the beach or in the desert,5
Amazing food and service even when it was jam packed with people. Loved their morning bottomless mimosas offer. The best deal in Vegas for alcohol. I ordered the omelette and hash. The egg was cooked perfectly and loved the generous amounts of filling. Will definitely go there again.,5
Amanda was the BEST!!!! SO friendly and welcoming.,5
I had a free coupon for a Margarita to get one free and it was just a ploy to get you in because they only had one kind that was for the coupon and it was not very good,4
ROBERT THE WAITER WAS GREAT. LOVED THE DRAWINGS ON RECEIPT AND SAYING THANK YOU. EXTRA EFFORT MEANT A LOT,5
We only had the trio platter and margaritas which was soo good.,4
Great place to eat. Fun atmosphere.  The sandwiches are juge,5
Fun environment and great drinks,5
If you go to Vegas and are looking for some great food and very friendly staff stop in here . Below is a picture of The Havana Burger I had it was delicious it was like a burger and a Cuban sandwich had a baby I know that sounds like an odd way to  describe it but it's the best I can do. The drink below is called  Change in Latitude also very refreshing.,5
Loved it really good food and prices.,5
"Great experience.
Had the fish and chips, very tasty.
Service was wonderful.",5
Excellent margaritas and good happy hour,5
Good food n good service,4
"A great place for a casual breakfast! Service was good and friendly, plus you get a ton of food for the price.",5
Fun environment. Definitely going again.,5
Breakfast was good. The Perfect Margarita was just that PERFECTION!,5
Honestly was expecting more for a big city in comparison to what I could have experienced back home in VA.,3
Loved the drinks great Nacho's,4
We've been here several times and it was great. This time it was just so-so.,3
"I had been dreaming of margaritaville for years! The blender drink was good, the appetizer trio was alright wish we had picked something different! Server really didnt come around much to see if we needed anything.",4
Fun place to dine!,5
Great place with good prices and daily promos,5
"Super burgers, great value & service",5
By far the best restaurant we ate at during our trip. Excellent quality and outstanding service! Highly recommend!!!,5
"Margaritaville was a good place for lunch. However, we tried going for their breakfast and they stopped taking reservation at 930, which was strange since it's in Vegas.",4
We really liked the food and drinks Try the Count Shrimp .soooo good,5
So much fun! Lots of great drinks and lots of people watching to do if you sit at the bottom bar along the strip,5
Super fun place great drinks,5
"Volcano nachos are off the charts! Very well worth the price. Highly recommend the Mac n cheese, as well.",5
Right at the Vegas Strip!!! Love this place! Food was great. Great Service. Great food! Great drinks!!,5
We waited about 15 minutes to get a table which is not bad. The staff was very friendly and the food was good. And the prices are decent.,5
"Good food, good service.",5
The shrimp and grits were awesome,5
….. the only thing I liked was that the wait was short and the appetizer nachos were tasty though it mostly had chips and toppings on the very top layer. Don’t order fish and chips. We waited a good 40 minutes after our appetizer for what seemed to be Gordon’s fish sticks and not even the beer battered kind. Also the music is kind of a bore and does every tv really have to show the same uninteresting performances? (No sports etc) This place needs to pick it up a notch to match the times. I also noticed every song was a horrible rendition. Like classic Bob Marley songs. Oh and there’s one table that folds down on all sides that’s  different than all the other ones in the main area. You should just get rid of it. Forgot the “Island rice” it’s just white rice clumped together. I should have taken pictures but was so exhausted from the heat wave and the wait for entrees.lol,2
"The chilaquiles here are terrible. If you like true Mexican/hispanic food DO NOT GET CHILAQUILES FROM THIS PLACE.
They serve you actual Doritos with guacamole and eggs and it was pretty gross. It is a very expensive place and it is not worth it in my opinion.",1
"Good for what it is. Large portions. There is alot going on inside. Concert videos, fake volcano eruption etc.service was good and got in fairly quickly given it's on the strip.",4
Great place all around.,5
Great food. Ok drinks,4
Average food and weak drinks. Fun atmosphere but I was expecting more.,3
So far so good. $6.50 Margaritas can't beat it. Wait staff is really nice and accommodated our 22 person group.,5
The food prices were a little high and the waiter was more concerned about the table with all the young girls.  But on the other hand they gave us a free dinner photo key chain.,4
"If I could rate negative stars, I would! Was going to try this place for the first time while in Vegas and had questions. When I called the young lady answering the phone was extremely rude. I asked a simple question to know if breakfast/brunch was served all day and if there were bottomless mimosas. She said “What!?”, audibly sighed, proceeded to complain to a coworker about “Why do they keep calling about breakfast all day!” as she proceeded to disconnect the line. Like she literally hung up on me! Extremely unprofessional and I will never go to this location because of my initial experience.",1
One of my favorite places to eat on the strip...food and drinks are always fantastic! And a great location in the middle of everything the strip has to offer,5
The raspberry margarita was delicious!  Good happy hour on house margaritas & beer.  Chill atmosphere.  Convient from the strip & flaming hotel.,4
Breakfast overlooking the strip was nice. Service was good. Everyone was nice and food arrived pretty quickly.,4
Good vibes. I got the Lava Lava shrimp. It was delicious! A few beers too at the bar. The start of a great night out in Vegas.,5
Great experience. Good service and nice atmosphere,5
"First time coming here. My aunt enjoyed her salad. Me on the other hand, my sandwich was okay..nothing to craze about. Fresh and fast service.",4
"Food wasn't good at all, and the service was ok. They take pictures of you with the group you come with. The complimentary picture is tiny (bit worth even keeping) and if you're a couple they take a pic of you then charge you (after receiving consent)$20 for a black and white pic of you and your partner. You get it with a paper frame.It isn't worth it. For 2 people you can easily pay around $70 for 2 meals. The only meals I'd say to go with are the soups and burgers. The appetizer was great (tortilla chips with cheese, brands, jalapenos) I was disappointed  with my meal catch of the day. Bland and the vegetables were though and needed some more streaming. I didn't enjoy the salad either. Margaritaville in Jamaica is amazing and the food is way better.

Just a recommendation, if your server dropped something and some of the cream, dressing or whatever went on a customer's clothing, face and hair, his meal should be for free. Some of it even went into our friends drink, they replaced the drink. Not even an appropriate apology. No manager showed up, just a 15% discount and the meal wasnt good.

The live entertainment is ok and you can watch music videos on a large t.v. Screen.",2
"Did lunch, fish and chips with my wife.  Good food and drinks.  Excellent service as well.",5
Good food. Small tables.,5
The food tasted good. Our waiter is awesome. Only thing the food is a bit pricey.,3
"Great food, drinks, service, etc. However, the entire time we were there they only played 2 jimmy buffet songs? Mostly played top 40?",4
"Skip the table and just go sit at bar with Jeff as your bartender you can't go wrong, we also ordered lunch at the bar and all the plates of our conversational strangers at the bar looked good and we ate most of the sampler we ordered. Mixed drinks were good",5
Not to happy with the food and it is way over priced I know it is convenient but won't eat there again,1
Nachos were warm but good. Our kid had a monkey on a coconut tree balloon animal made for him while we waited which he loved. Service was excellent!,4
Nasty margaritas taste like sour juice.,1
The food was great.,5
Food was pretty good here and they have shows throughout the day,5
Ok food at not so ok prices..,3
"Friendly and efficient,  food was good.",4
The food here isn't bad. However I don't recommend the jambalaya it's very bland but the spinach and artichoke dip is very delicious and the service is good.,3
I would love going  to this place the coconut shrimp are the best!,5
At bar... the bartenders wouldn't clean the bar where we sat just put napkins on it and served us drinks  urghh After awhile,3
"Great food, great service and love the all day happy hour. Terry was a great bartender",5
Love this restaurant. This one serves a great breakfast. Service is always fast and friendly. Have been several times always a great time. Prices are good. Food is wonderful especially the breakfast which was a surprise. Opens early closes late. Happy friendly service. It's 5 o'clock somewhere. It's 5 all the time at Margaritaville...........,5
Disgusting. How do you mess up a burger. I went with that because nothing was appealing on the menu. They got a 1 star because the drinks were good and that's it! And the prices are too expensive for dog food....,1
"Nice ambiance, but too hard to get to and the food doesn't justify the price.  There are too many better places and deals nearby.",2
The RUDE HOSTESS said they were no longer seating people even though there were people eating & waiting. Do NOT RECOMMEND AND WILL NEVER RETURN!,1
"Had French toast and waffles for breakfast, food is delicious and drinks are good too friendly and cheerful servers",5
"Drinks are great, food is ok. If you eat here, get something simple like a chicken quesadilla. But nice atmosphere inside as well.",4
Jambalaya!! Wings!! Service lebel.was awesome as well!!,5
We were there this past weekend and Nachos and wings were delicious! I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita and my husband a frozen mango..horrible! They use lemon slush and then just pour strawberry or mango syrup over it and it doesn't taste like a strawberry or mango margarita..it taste like a lemon margarita. My husband ordered a modelo to finish eating and I just had water. The waitress was very nice about it but only deducted one of the margaritas.,2
"This place is awesome, pretty good food and service, but it's the character of the place that really stands out. Would definitely come back if I'm in Vegas again!",4
Food is decent regular bar like food. But service was horrible older male bartender was very rude mumbled a lot and acted like we inconvenienced him for being there. He told me I couldn't get a drink I had the day before waiting asked another bartender no problem. He definitely made us not want to come again.,3
Cool environment. Took a long while to get food.,4
"Great service. Our server was Misty, and she did a great job. Food was excellent",5
Good service. If you like it you like it.  Lol 💜,4
Absolutely loved!!!!!!! We went here for a trip. The bar tender is nice and the artichoke dip is really good. Overall you should definitely come here,5
Great margarita! Lava lava shrimp yummy!,5
"We flew in to Vegas on the 23rd of April, and was suggested to go to the Magaritiville restaurant,  so I ordered the volcano nachos,  and my friend ordered another kind of nachos that had chicken in them, but they were the worst nachos I ever ordered in my life.  The volcano nachos,  supposed to have chili on top of it, but mostly I saw was just cheese and a few beans sprinkled around,  and my friends nachos barely had any chicken on it.  My wife kept me from complaining,  so I didn't say anything.  I was so disappointed with the food, especially for what we paid for it.  I will never go back to this restaurant.   Do not order the volcano nachos,  or you will be disappointed.",1
Our sever was absolutely amazing and so attentive made our experience there the best I loved it,5
"Wonderful margaritas. I had the seafood Mac & cheese, my spouse had the steak dinner",4
Loved it!! Great service! Great Food! Great Atmosphere!,5
Great atmosphere and friendly staff,5
"Classic Eggs Benedict. Poached Eggs cooked to perfection, hand cut Canadian Bacon and a crispy English Muffin.  Very well prepared. The Hollandaise Sauce was the classic with Paprika.  I travel the world and always sample the Eggs Benedict.  This was one of the best on ingredients and preparation.
Two minor options would definitely make this the best.  In New York City I first had a version using Cayenne Pepper instead of Paprika.
The pepper does not overheat the tongue but warms the back of the throat, adding a pleasing kick to the meal.
The second addition would be added lemon or lime into the sauce or even if freshly squeezed on top.  Those additions would be perfection for me with a glass of Champagne or Sparkling wine.
The breakfast price was exactly what I paid for two bottles of water at the hotel last night, $15.
I will definitely return when I am in Vegas.
Sabrina was excellent and helped to start a wonderful day. Thank you",5
Didn't have any fish for the fish and chips. Food was cold and for this there was a wait to get seated. Too pricey for what you get. Wouldn't recommend this restaurant.,2
"Every time I go to vegas this place is a must great margaritas, nachos are massive(toppings could be a bit more even tho) and other food is always good",5
Enjoyed the ambiance but the food was not as full filling especially for the price. Jimmy Buffet fan but probably won’t visit again,2
"Really good food and excellent service. Usually a wait w/o a reservation. Their mimosa special is delicious, fun, and a bargain.",5
The bomb diggy.,5
Seevice is lack luster! But good drinks,3
Great food. Ribs were the best I've had in a long time. Service a little slow but we are in Vegas,4
"My wife and I ordered a plate of nachos to share and we each ordered a salad. When the nachos came out, we realized that the salads were a mistake. We probably ate about 1/3 of the nachos, they were massive and delicious. They were layered with chilli, shredded cheese, cheese sauce and had sour cream, guacamole, jalapeños, and pico de gallo on top. We didn’t even touch our salads as we we full from the nachos. I can safely say that the nachos would be enough food for 4-6 adults. The prices are high but what can you expect for it being on the strip?  Amazing decor as well.",5
"Amazing drinks and food! The giant pretzel and cheese was amazing! Loved the atmosphere too, laid back.",5
Great theme or scene. Waiter was amazing Robert!! Clean busy of course its the strip. Food was as expected nothing amazing average.,5
"I mean, what are you really expecting? You know what you’re getting. It’s a fun, maybe obnoxious drinking crowd, a themish menu of beachy pub food. The service is laid back and pleasant and the atmosphere is fun. Like, an adult rainforest cafe. Sort of. Come for the drinks and the laughs and a snack.",4
Good service. Food is alright. If you have a large enough group a margarita filled tower is fun.,5
We were seated very quickly. Food was excellent! Service was friendly.,5
Its 5 o'clock somewhere!,4
Very good food and ambience. Have dinner there 3 times of 7 days at Las Vegas.,4
Had a great time having dinner and watching the visuals and atmosphere they provide,5
"The service wasn't that great with a particular waiter that we had. The food was great! I had the shrimp and grits. However, it was a little spicy. If it weren't for the waiter we had I would have given a 5 star rating.",4
I love this place. The food the drink and the service is always good,4
We went for happy hour! $7 margs and $5 draft,5
Excellent breakfast! The best we had in vegas!!,5
"Ordered the chicken fajitas which came out on time and the service was good. The fajita chicken was insanely dry also there was barely any chicken  they tried hiding this by loading the plate with a ton of under cooked bell pepper.

My other guests ordered the valcano natchos which look good on the outside but are just a pile of chips with some cheese on top very little meat and nothing in the middle

Edit: bumped up one star they have apologized",3
"During our trip to Vegas, we had dinner at Margaritaville and BOTH got food poisoning! Needless to say, this ruined our entire trip as we were bed ridden for the remainder of our vacation. If you dine here, DO NOT get the shrimp or fish. Not only was it not delicious, it was obviously bad, old or a combination of both. Extremely disappointed considering the hype this restaurant has.",1
My husband and I had lunch here this past weekend.  And while there it seemed nice and friendly.  The waiter told us we got there on happy hour. We ordered our drinks our appetizers and then another order of drinks with our lunch. He brought us our drinks first and then our food came and he sneakingly placed our check on the table. My husband didn't even notice until I pointed it out.  We definitely didn't feel welcomed anymore.  We paid and we left. I mean if it has something to do with the pandemic its totally fine. We were not planning on staying there all day. But a heads up would of been nice. We weren't even offered any deserts . I will definitely not come here again. I know we won't make a difference but definitely wanted to rate my review. We felt so much in a rush we didn't even get our picture from the lady that takes them there.,2
My baby and me sipping on booze in a blender,4
Great place for a simple lunch or dinner. Service was great too (Jaymee).,5
Right on the Vegas strip.. the establishment is very well known for its great atmosphere.. killer margarita drinks.. and a lot of fun. Highly recommended. Barry 🇨🇦,5
Good food and good drinks,5
Always fantastic fun at this relaxed place. Love the music and love style of Jimmy Buffet.,4
"We always go to margarittaville when we go to vegas, has a good vive.",5
"Friendly staff. Food was okay, the atmosphere was Disney artificial like.",3
"Really good buffet this morning. Lucky to get a free Sam Adams Rosé sample with my breakfast and enjoyed some souvenir shopping afterwards. Food on the plate is pancakes, french toast, scrambled eggs with some salsa drizzled on top, hash browns, bacon and smoked tuna ceviche. Bit of fruit and a small tart.",5
"I don't eat pork. Pigs don't release toxins and have 4 stomachs that can digest anything.

That being said, I had one of the pork cubans here; it wasn't greasy and it actually tasted good. The fries were bomb, steak style.

thanks Vlad and friends",5
"Staff is friendly, I want to shout out to the busers especially though. They were working hard.",4
"My wife and I were in Vegas for Christmas and we bought some glasses from the retail shop. My wife was really excited about the glasses. We get home a few days later wash the glasses to find out that the image on the glass came off. Not happy about that at all. Here’s the best part I called the retail shop and advised them of this and the answer I got was yes we know it happens and to be careful washing them. (These glasses are nearly 20 bucks and the image comes off, seriously guys a million dollar store can’t afford quality products.) Then the lady on the phone told me that the manager will call me in a few days. Well see about that she probably didn’t even write my number down. Well played Jimmy Buffett it’s not 5 o’clock here can’t even use my glass to drink out of. If there was a -5 star ⭐️ that’s what I would rate it.",1
"Can't beat Margaritaville . . . always great food, cold beverages, and 5 o'clock!",5
"Was good. Had the nachos lava and strawberry margarita. We went during the noon, not busy, hostess was nice and our waitress checked up on us. Will go again",4
"Great food and service. Food was hot, fresh and the wait was short.",5
Service was super slow and it was not crowded. Margaritas were horrible and sour. Never again,2
"Food not good at all, it’s cold and dry, the nachos look and teste like they were made 2 days before and they just threw them in the microwave to warm them up. Staff and restaurant are nice just need better food",1
Such an amazing atmosphere and staff. Love this place,5
Great Pretzels and Coconut Shrimp Highly recommend these items on the menu.,5
Good food! Not blown away by their margarita though... I guess I had higher expectations.,4
I’m from Chicago and I just ordered some chicken and it was disgusting could’ve been fried longer and the sauce even worst but the service was good,1
"Once again,Margaritville did not fail to impress. Excellent food,great service and a fun and relaxing atmosphere.",5
Great food. Classic margarita.,5
"Great atmosphere, fantastic service with special drinks.",5
"Only part of the menu is offered, but understandable since they are just opening back up. Food was ok. Service was great. Great for families.",3
Good food  good service,4
Great place to eat in Vegas. Loved the atmosphere. Food was sensational.,5
I love this kind o atmosphere.  You can dine in a boat or under key west signs!  Parrotheads go for this and if you are of that persuasion go ahead and stop in.,5
Food and drinks were delicious and the staff very friendly,5
"Slow service, high prices, mediocre food. Very very very cold. Probably 68° F in there. Too cold. Paid $100 for 3 entrees, 3 drinks & appetizer. Wouldn't go again.",1
"The best fruity cocktail I've ever tasted. Food was great, service too! It's a little more pricey than expected but it was worth it.",5
Good food great service fun place.... Tried seating us by the kitchen in the back..... Again...,4
Great margaritas good service. Kinda high priced but you are in Vegas... .,4
The volcano 🌋 nachos will test your limits,5
"Stay away from the volcano nachos unless you planning to feed about 4. Its massive!!
Really good!!",4
"Food, drinks, and service was great",5
Cute graphic show during our lunch. Beware the nachos appetizer is huge.,5
First time here. Hostess was kind of rude but the server was fantastic.  Food was good too ! Great margaritas!,5
"Came in on Saturday February 1, 2020 @ 9:55 AM.  Bartender was making drinks, and did not acknowledge me, albeit I was sitting right in front of him.  He handed off  a few drinks started making more, looked up acknowledged a couple walking behind me, then started making drinks again (very slowly I might add) while continuing to ignore me.  There are plenty of other places to take my business in Vegas which is exactly what I did.",1
This place rocks and food and atmosphere are amazing,5
Strong drinks and a nice atmosphere.,4
Had a burger and fish/chips.  Both were excellent.  Moonshine laced drinks we both loved.,5
Was very disappointed with food and drinks Florida is better,2
"Fun beachy vibes, good food, good drinks,
This place is a vibe!",4
Had a wild Bloody Mary made from all sorts of foods. The slider was kind of without taste and the bread was stale. The decor is really outdated and gathering dust.,4
Great food and awesome drinks! Try the perfect margarita!,5
The waitress was really slow on taking orders but the breakfast was decent,3
"The coffee was good but the breakfast food was not good. The omlet was dry; half the food on the plate was cold when it arrived and the other half luke warm; the toast was cold and was not buttered, and the provided butter was hard; the over medium eggs came more undercooked than I've ever seen over easy eggs; and upon arrival the bacon looked like a bear had gotten a hold of it.",2
"It was pleasurable for everyone in our party, except for me. I didn't want anything to eat or drink, except ice water and I couldn't even get that, until towards the end of the evening, like a few minutes before we left.",4
"Great location for great chain restaurant, excellent service",5
Had hamburger and was good with good service,4
I only rated a 3 because we only ordered drinks from the Tiki Bar. So we really didn't experience much here for me to give a full rating. The drinks were good though.,3
C'mon! Margaritaville! Nice all around! Great Frozen Margarita!,5
"Great atmosphere, food was really good and the margaritas were wonderful",5
"Love the music and how it plays the music videos. Nachos were amazing, full of fresh toppings. Many delicious varieties if margaritas. Super disappointed in the service, the staff we encountered seemed annoyed and were not very friendly.",3
Great food. Great ambiance,5
Great happy hour.,5
Jimmy buffet ....all I have to say💖,5
"Fun place to go and have a drink. Ordered the blender pitcher as a drink and some appetizers. Service was quick, friendly and fun. Has a gift shop attached with lots if different Margaritaville souvenirs.",5
Good food. Excellent service. They are navigating the virus well in spite of being very busy.,5
Good food good atmosphere,5
Good food and service.,5
"Terrible. Out of shrimp, out of Onion Rings. Then no vegan options.",1
Go for the street entertainment. Always something happening on the strip.,5
Loved this restaurant and good atmosphere,5
Cool but unfortunately we didn't get to eat here they could not handle a group are size,3
"Food amazing, service was phenomenal, and prices are good. Their signature cocktails were so good!",5
"This is such a neat restaurant to enjoy with friends and family. Just the environment and atmosphere is worth a stop. The music, maybe 6 ft tall shot glass, and the active volcano make the stop worth it. Not to mention, their amazing margaritas!!",5
Great burgers and fries and of course drinks! Love Margaritaville. It's always 5o'clock somewhere!,5
Pretty good brunch and drinks.,4
"Hostess station was tucked behind the bar and around, 10 minutes for getting our drink order, margarita was tiny, the smallest Cuban sandwich ever, and the toilets were atrocious. Save your money.",1
Great service. Great drinks. Great food. Caught the volcano show.the photographer got some great pics. We had a great time.,5
"Understaffed and rude. We left after the bartender informed us, after waiting for 20 minutes, that we were lucky that she was helping us at all.",1
First place we always stop when we get to Vegas. Good drink prices on the strip,5
Fantastic atmosphere and food was awesome highly recommend,4
Service was excellent. Food was very good. We all ordered different entrees.  All came out together and hot.  Great atmosphere.,5
Great drinks and food and outstanding service!,5
Live music but drinks are not great.,3
"Margaritas were delightful, tasted like I was drinking actual alcohol! Couldn't have been better, and sweet patio spot for people-watching.",5
"Very neat, fast service, had a frozen margarita, it was tasty",5
"Good music, food, and customer service",3
"We were allowed to came just for drinks, since we didn't have a reservation. We sit at the Bar. The Bartender was very friendly and engaging, personable as well. I will come back just because of him, sorry I don't remember his name.",5
Good food and good service. 👍,5
They were extremely accommodating to our party size. Food and appetizers were delicious. If you want to have an intimate conversation it’s a little loud but I’d highly recommend visiting.,5
Smallest $13 margarita ever..... and the music is not margaritaville themed.... disappointed,1
"This is one of the best dine in restaurants I’ve ever been to.
Loved the ambience, it was so much fun.
There were entertainers walking around in stilts and making balloon toys for kids.
And the food was extremely delicious.
This place rocks!",5
"Nice, relaxing place and good food.",5
Great happy hour!,5
Definitely not what I expected.,3
Didn't eat here but the shop was good.,5
Nice breakfast but could have been warmer. Great coffee and free refills. Will be back,4
Food and  atmosphere was good,5
"Atmosphere is what you would expect, fun and tropical themed with Jimmy's music and live concerts of his playing on TVs all around. Food is decent and portions are large. However... The margaritas are TERRIBLE. The basic margarita is a cup of sweet n sour with a little tequila. I also tried the ""Livin' it up"" which features Casamigos tequila (my favorite) along with the usual suspects in a margarita plus pastuerized egg whites. I must say I like this idea, as egg whites usually create a nice foamy/creamy texture. However, pastuerized egg whites don't work in that way. Once they are pastuerized they no longer act like a normal egg white making it useless in this manner. Just switch to real egg whites and you will see a night and day difference! Although, once again this margarita was far too sweet. This is coming from someone who likes drinks on the sweet side!",3
"We enjoyed this restaurant and bar.  Quick, friendly service, good food, cold drinks and our party enjoyed the experience.",4
"Went to Margaritaville for lunch.  Food was good as usual for Margaritaville.  Volcano nachos were delicious.  Staff was friendly, decor was what you would expect.",5
Had a shrimp scampi linguine. Good,3
"The server was so kind! i’m not sure of her name but she had purple hair :) my critique is that the nachos are only covered on the first layer. when you reach the center there is nothing but plain chip. but again, we had the KINDEST server!",3
Had a blast my first time here! We got fish tacos and seafood mac and cheese.,4
Great food delicious margherita's  With a bright and colourful atmosphere,5
"Great food, great atmosphere. Fun place to go.",5
Perfect example of the Margaritaville Chain. Excellent service and wasn't too pricey for the Strip.,4
"Best house margaritas on the strip. Tried them in every hotel this trip.
Ceaser says come, but, wear a mask.",5
So when I showed up the restaurant didn't have my reservation..I was seated 2 minutes after breakfast had stopped because we were waiting to be seated so we were too late to eat the steak and eggs that's the only thing we wanted.. it didn't post anywhere when breakfast would stop.and I have been calling for the last two days since I've been in Vegas to confirm my reservation and no one has answered my phone call so that's why there was no reservation we came here. I will not be coming back there are plenty of better restaurants in walking distance,2
Burger was fantastic. Drinks were great. Awesome atmosphere,5
"Good food, nice staff! We loved it❤",4
"Love the food, atmosphere, and ""Happy Hour Pricing!"".....",5
Really nice place! Good food!,4
We had the Thai Shrimp appetizer and  the Jumbalya dinner! Both were excellent!! Topped off with a Margarita and Banana Daiquiri! Great lunch!!!,5
"Excellent food and service, in a great location. Prices average for breakfast on the Strip.",5
Great service best tarter sauce I've ever eaten,4
Great place to people watch or just meet people and chat at the bar. Reasonable beer prices (for Vegas) and good food. Laid back atmosphere in a glitzy town!,5
Service was excellent. Food was great. Drinks were pretty good.,5
Love this place. The food is good and the margaritas are great. We kept ending up here on our vacation in Las Vegas.,5
Very good need one in THE ATL,4
Great happy hour and a wide variety of menu options.  The house margaritas and nachos are the bomb.,5
"The service that we've had today and in the past is what makes us come back, the food is great, but the service is fantastic. Tonight our waiter Ryan went above and beyond. To give some perspective, we've all been living through a pandemic and kindness and patience has not been everyone's strong suit. This has been hands down the best service I've received in all of 2020. This is the last thing some may expect going to a tourist attraction off the strip, but they treat you like you're more than a tourist. Ryan made this a beyond fantastic experience, his manager Kevin was also a pleasure working with. We look forward to coming back.",5
Little expensive but fun place for all.,5
Bartenders were great. 30min wait for table. Stayed in the bar instead.,4
"If you are a person that doesn't like the Jimmy Buffett scene and music, you may still like this place. If you are a person that considers themselves a Parrot Head or likes the beach party scene, you'll love the atmosphere. The food is really good. It was hard to decide on what to eat because everything looked so good.if you have ever heard of Jimmy Buffett, if recommend you give this place a try.",5
Happy hour is worth it! It gets pretty busy but if you're patient you'll be served a few times within the happy hour time frame. Tip well! The bartenders deserve it! The DJ keeps the crowd engaged with some great music. Gets pretty entertaining after a few drinks for sure.,5
Margaritaville never disappoints!! We eat here at least once every time we come to Las Vegas and it is always a party! Great selection of food and lots of fun drinks. The Jimmy Buffett music gets you feeling like you are on an island drinking tropical drinks under a palm tree or partying on a boat. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The Volcano show and the people on the stilts are a fun bit of entertainment! Don't miss Margaritaville!!,5
Loved the food here. The service is amazing. Gets a bit loud for a few but overall great place to eat,5
Great atmosphere and of course the margaritas were amazing!!,5
It’s always five o’clock here! Great food! Great beer! Amazing service!,5
Ryan was one of the best servers I've ever had but they need to play more Jimmy Buffett somgs,3
You know whenever I get a play stitches Margaritaville I absolutely have to check it out well they did not let me down they are amazing I like to stay at through places and eat at their places because they are absolutely wonderful check amount whenever you're in town and you especially the one in Key West,5
Nice venue. Try the Key Lime Pie.,5
"I recently went on vacation to Vegas and on the way there my friend kept talking about this place called margaritaville. I was very curious so that was my first stop after I landed. They have an all day happy hour which was a plus for me and the pasta I ordered was amazing. Every server I came in contact with was amazing. I loved the place and the experience that I went back a second time right before my flight! Thanks Margaritaville , I will be coming back !!!",5
Best cheeseburger I've had in a long time,5
Went for Happy Hour and Breakfast...Really Fun Great Service and Really Good Food...,5
"Great food, live music, fun times!",4
"Hostess is RUDE!! Never been here because of the way we were treated going in we will never go back and try either. I will take my money elsewhere, where I am treated nicely!",1
"Our drinks were good, but the food not so much",3
"Got put outside without being asked, right against a very busy pedestrian traffic area. We couldn't see live show or hear the music. Waiter didn't know the menu and couldn't answer our questions. We inquired about desserts and he had to go check. Waiter never came back to check on us even after getting our food. He left too quickly for any additional requests. Good portions and good taste. First time being here and probably won't be back.",1
Good food.,5
"Great food, fabulous entertainment!!",5
The staff was amazing really very helpful the food was great enjoy the atmosphere as well great people definitely recommend to any and everyone,5
the people are very nice and the service is the best i seen here. the server Marie is very kind and looks out for you. the bartender made really good drinks.,4
"Just went for drinks, bar service was good",4
Amazing margaritas 🍹 and awesome people who work there!,5
We had an amazing time! Tesily was our waitress and she was absolutely amazing! Adam was the bartender and the drinks couldn't have been more perfect! We had an awesome evening! Love this place!!!❤ The staff made our visit the best!,5
Food was dry and service was slow. Had a minor allergic reaction to a salad and couldn’t eat it. They still charged full Price and denied responsibility.,1
Cheese Burgers in Paridise,5
"Rather loud but fun.  Food was okay.  My ""perfect margarita"" was a little less than perfect but the second was better except too much ice. Great wait staff and balloon people.",3
"As always,   my burger was excellent",5
"Good food, nice atmosphere, great entertainment",5

8 hr slow cooked corned beef hash. Amazing food,5
Delicious and wait wasn't bad.,5
The food was meh but the service was great!,3
Great food and beautiful decor inside the restaurant,5
"Don't waste your time or money. It may have been awesome once, but there are far better dining experiences in Vegas. We were celebrating a birthday and it was a flop. Poor service, average food and dark and dirty inside. Wish I could give a better review because I love Jimmy Buffet but no.",2
"It's not the Margaritaville of old but the food and drinks are still good, just needs a remodel.",4
"First time in the margarita ville in Las Vegas. I have been in a few margarita villes over the time. This one is on the bottom of the list. Waitress was really nice, helpful, a couple of times we needed to wait a longer time because it was 'busy'. Food was not good this time, it looked okayish but the taste was not good at all. The same for my friends at the table. The margaritas were the best part of this visit, we had a couple of those and they were all really tasty. Good point: friendly waitress, really nice margaritas. Bad points: the decoration (looks outdated) and the food.",3
Excellent hangover recovery place. Just right!,5
"Went for our Anniversary, appetizers and Margaritas were amazing! Waiter was great! And got pics to remember the night!",5
"Feel fun atmosphere to be had here, great drinks selection with also a great view of the strip",4
"Atmosphere was pleasant, food was good but if you've got some sodium issues, not the best place for a burger but if you're good inthat area, get the burger!",3
The food is delicious.  I had buffalo wings and we all split nachos,5
Food is very good and I love the entertainment. Lots of fun!!,5
Excellent food and drinks. Great atmosphere,5
A fun place to meet friends or just grab a drink and a burger,4
Best drinks and food!! 😋😋😋😋😋,5
PEDRO THE PIRATE HE IS A GREAT SPORT,5
"Pretty much what you would expect, and that's what i wanted! I enjoyed the margarita w/ red bull",5
"Great service,  very friendly,  food was delicious 😋",5
"We had ok experience with food choices, need to download QR code to read menu. Handled cleaning under circumstances. Earlier calls to host stated band/entertainment. That didn't happen. Better option than most that don't offer reservations.",3
"Good food, good atmosphere.",5
"Stopped in for a quick drink with friends, we got that food and a photo from staff walking around the food was solid bar food and the drinks were about average the atmosphere was great.",4
"Awesome place for happy hour,  Mongo's the best!!",5
"Little loud even for me. Food was good, service was great. I recommend the BlackBerry Moonshine Margarita...",4
"Food was superb. We got in early on our last day so we had no wait. The wait times at a lot of places on the strip was about 1 hour + due to covid restrictions. Not only was my club sandwich delicious, service was great, and you get a free keychain which was pretty cool and a nice touch. Highly recommend and will be back in the future !",5
Good food and good staff,5
"Went here for the Jamican Jerk chicken wings.  I have only been to the one in Florida. In comparison to the one at universal,  this one does not measure up. The customer service was poor. They were out of their signature beer. Question,  how the hell do you run out of your signature beer.",3
I was sooo.. full.. 🍽️🍖🥔🍹😋,4
🌋 nachos and good music? I'm sold. Been here twice and had a blast both times,5
We live in Florida and this restaurant did not disappoint great atmosphere.,5
Loved this place.,5
THE FOOD AND DRINKS WERE AMAZING...THANKS FOR THE AWESOME EXPERIENCE. VLAD & AMANDA... THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE ON POINT...TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK #SALUTE ❤,5
Best margaritas I've ever had!,5
Great drinks and great bartenders!!,5
Over priced and over rated. Went just for the experience.,3
Nachos were excellent and prices reasonable compared to many places on the Strip.,5
What's it take to get a decent drink in here?  They couldn't make a simple mojito upstairs?!?!?,2
Love their brunch selection!,4
Jimmy Buffets finest,5
Nice spot good drinks ...,4
Walked across the street from Ceasers Palace to come here and I must say the drinks are amazing. I've been to other Maragaritaville's and maybe its just the hype of Vegas but the drinks are great.,5
Loved it. Here in vegas from indiana for my first time,5
Good food,5
"Great food, service & atmosphere.",5
Security guy was a dueschebag..food was great and service was good other that the secirity guy. I would recommend food as long as security guy isnt around.,1
Was great. They .ade my wife and strawberry n mango margarita frozen and she loved it. She's picky as she doesn't like the taste of alcohol. I had the fish n chips and wife and her friend had the garlic bacon burger a and they both loved them. Was actually too much to eat. Thanks!,5
Great Food,5
Always great.,5
Pretty good place and laid back. Good drink prices.,4
The service was quick and they even gave us to go cups so we could take our drinks with us! Not too sweet but strong. Perfect!,5
I can't wait to go back to Vegas just for this breakfast.,5
Had the appetizer platter and it was so good ..me and my girlfriend split it and had left overs,5
Best shrimp and service!,5
very good food great staff right on the strip,5
Dining was great. Waitress was amazing,5
Thought this was going to be very commercialized and simple margaritas but was i impressed!! Amazing margaritas!!! You have to stop in for one if you are passing by.,5
"We always enjoy a visit to Margaritaville.  Good food great drinks, terrific service.",5
"Great nacho volcano, large portions. The place itself has a very interesting design.",5
Fun roadhouse type of place.  Big menu.  Menu is large and has something for everyone.  May be a little pricey for some but it is on the strip in a resort hotel after all.   Turns into a bar type atmosphere at night.  Great spot for lunch though.,3
lots of fun. understandably out of some sesfood dishes with covid redtrictions,5
Virgil was awesome and the food was excellent at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend.,5
Great drinks and food at great prices,5
"Fun place, but quiet due to Covid. Waiter was great, food was good.",4
"It was good, better with great company from what I remembered lol",5
"Fried chicken was delicious. Service was terrible, not a great ambience, and the roving
Photographer was irritating.",2
I didn't care for the dryness in the volcano nachos and flavor wasn't there. Not wmenough chili and cheese for me.  Won't order that again,1
"Best drink deals on the strip in my opinion. Nothing beats a $6 margarita with actual tequila when you’re on the strip.

Shoutout to Jonathan for being an amazing bartender and giving us recommendations for our stay. We hope that they’ll update his name to be spelled correctly on the register soon.",5
Poor service and dry food,1
"I have always wanted to try Margaritaville and was looking forward to an early dinner here. It was a very hot day, but nice and cool in the entryway.  The hostess sat us very quickly,  and  walked us through a mostly empty restaurant to the back wall near a janitor sink. It was hot and a bit smelly at our table.  There were no menus, you had to pull it up on your phone. They could have something posted on the walls if they do not want us to touch anything. There is no way to get the feel of a menu on a two inch screen.  I am still not sure what they had.  So, we walked out. I realize that these are difficult times and we have to make allowances, but I felt like the unwanted step child that should not be seen.",1
Food and service was very good.,5
Loved everything about it. Better than AC!! Food and drinks were very good.,5
Me and my wife enjoyed the Volcano nachos,5
Great food!,5
"Horrible service!!! Neverrrrr again! Didn't even make it in the building with my family before being rudely disrespected by  The Host""Stephanie"". I understand people have personal problems at home but we didn't force you to work there. Really nasty attitude. If I can give this rating a -5 I would",1
"Their drinks are over the top,,, the bartenders are master mixologists. So I highly suggest when in Vegas you must come have a drink here... you'll be happy  you did.",5
Food was mediocre and service was lacking.,2
"This was a great place to hang out, drink some margaritas and enjoy the view. The margaritas were good - even better with their happy hour deals.",5
it was ok.   the service could have been better.,3
"Food and margaritas were ok.  For a place that has margarita in the name, you would hope these would be the best you ever tasted.  Bartender was nice and helpful.",3
Great food and atmosphere! Best nachos I've ever had! A Las Vegas must!,5
"Great atmosphere, people & food!",5
"They took conch fritters off the menu, No reason to go there now, needs serious updating....",1
Food was good but the drinks were better,5
On the pricey side,3
Awesome food! Great service!,5
Had the seafood Mac and cheese and it was AMAZING. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great.,5
Jon Choy was awesome. It was our second time there and by  far this was the best experience and it was my birthday. Eat too much but all the food we ordered was amazing. Diehard Hurricane drinker but the one particular harbor was awesome and I will have it again for sure,5
"Food was excellent, but be ready cause it's going to be pricey.",5
Great drinks!,5
GREAT service and delicious food.,5
Good vibes and drinks servers were awesome 👌,4
"Great experience here.  Jeff was an amazing bartender.  Fast service, and the drinks and food were excellent.",5
Two best times to go here? Breakfast from 8-11 am and get the corned beef hash. You're welcome. Happy hour with $6 margaritas and $3 off appetizers. They don't call it Margaritaville for nothing.,5
Great atmosphere.   Food was ok.,4
"Original review 1.  Food was tasteless (shrimp scampi), expensive and waitress was not very hospitable.

Raised this to a 3 from 1.  Hostess recognized my displeasure and comped the meal she also shared my thoughts with the manager.",3
"This is a must visit when you go to Vegas. They give you tons of food for the price and everything is super delicious! The interior is made to look like you are eating on boats on the water which is really cool! It's not too loud and they have great music playing while you eat. You can also get a really cool souvenir photo, and sometimes there's a clown on stilts making cool things out of balloons for any kids. I highly recommend visiting here!",5
Great drinks n view,4
Food and bar were great,4
Good food and great service,5
"Excellent service ,great drinks and food!!",5
Great food and service,5
Very good service,5
"Really enjoyed this place! Ordered the Key West omelet, it was delicious! Habanero Mango bloody mary. Stage was set nicely.",4
"Decent, over priced though. Spent 60$ on 2 sandwiches and a drink",3
Great service,5
"The food was decent and was overall pretty good. The prices are high however, and the menu is slightly boring. Visiting during happy hour definitely makes the food and drinks more worth it. The location is convenient and the staff are friendly.",3
"The bar attendance could be better. Waiter forgot to place our order. We sat for 20 min. until I finally asked. Appetizers were great when they got there and drinks were on point. The atmosphere was upbeat, enjoyed the live band.",3
Good food. Typical Margaritaville atmosphere. The staff was great and following the COVID restrictions.,4
"Love this place, the staff is really nice. Enjoyed the atmosphere and music. We even received a free picture from them.",5
Great portions and good atmosphere good food the 1 man Band was good.  (Chris Beau). You won't go out of here hungry.  Got the ribs there was a large portion and then time before got taco salad it was big.,5
Tonight just got in town went to dinner here it was awful. I just couldn’t believe the burger paid $17 for it the bun was terrible the cheese was worst. And I throw out the bacon I never in my entire life had I ever had bad bacon. How do you do this unbelievable waste of $60. Do yourself a favor and don’t ever go to this place horrible horrible horrible. Bad bacon I am floored how do you even talk to a manager about this completely disgusted.,1
Great food and atmosphere!,5
Love this place. Great food and atmosphere,5
Great place for laid back atmosphere and good cooking,4
"Very overrated, very bland food. First experience here. I’d go again but not for the price. Very, very bland. Did not enjoy, would not recommend the Cuban sandwich.",2
Breakfast menu is fabulous,5
This place was awesome. My family loved it great food and amazing service will visit again in future!!,5
Great food !!,5
"Adam,  Shawn,  and Ryan we're the best. Five foreskin stars!",5

"Food was very good, but prices are steep",4
BEST house margaritas EVER!,5
I love it Margaritaville,5
"Before we even got seated we waited 15 minutes, which is fine. However, when our buzzer went off, we came to the front counter and the two staff members were arguing. She took the buzzer and told us to go to the ""Do Not Trespass"" sign and wait. We waited again for a few minutes. A hostess approached and I presented our ticket. She snatched it out of my hand and didn't say a word or acknowledge us. She went to get our menus and just said ""follow me."" She sat us down and walked away. She didn't even get us four sets of cutlery considering there was four of us seated. So great start right? How hard is it to smile and be attentive to the number of the party. Oh yeah, there were empty tables everywhere. So why the wait?

On top of that, the chicken fajitas were awful. They were little chicken chunks almost like chicken balls. They only give you four tortilla wraps. They had no lettuce, no tomatoes, and no cheese. I had to ask for a side of pico. Not to mention. The server placed the receipt ticket on top of our nachos. How disgusting is that!? We did how ever buy the cute photo from the nice lady taking the pictures. It was cute and we were trying to make the best of it even though the food and service was awful. Such a shame, considering our first visit together five years ago was amazing. Customer service is dead.",1
Expensive.  No small plates. Margarita was too syrupy.,3
Food and drinks are good. Our waiter was very kind. It is a fun place to go for the decor and atmosphere.,4
Nice place to have dinner,5
Food portions were good sized and our waiter was wonderful! He refilled our drinks promptly as we had just spent a very long day of travel. We would diffantly eat here again!,5
Nice clean not to long of a wait,5
"We came here twice on vacation: once the staff were meh, and once the staff were great. I guess maybe it depends on what time you go. The food was good both times we went!",4
Great time.  Fun experience amd good food!,5
Cool place to dine. We were one of only a few guest there because of covid!,4
All bad.,1
"It was just okay.  Took forever to get waited on.  Then the food was ok.  Nothing great, find somewhere else to eat for the price.",3
Very good Lava Shrimp. Great house margarita!,5
Such a fun restaurant and bar and awesome atmosphere!!,5
Limited menu drinks were not that good food overpriced seafood combo taste like frozen food  yuck,1
Food and drinks were Delicious,5
Wide selection of margaritas! My favorite was the blueberry pomegranate margarita 🤤,5
"Amazing atmosphere and the staff was incredibly accommodating! I have dietary restrictions and they were more than happy to help me out. A little pricey, but it’s Vegas. Our bartender, I believe his name was Adam, was really awesome. The drinks were strong and delicious.",5

"cheap drinks, nice place, best service, good bang for your buck and super margaritas",5
Best Bahama mommas. Bartenders are awesome,5
"Very nice place,",5
Great service!,5
"Nothing special, lots of mistakes.",3
Best burger and fried pickles. And our server was omg handsome. Mask and all..,5
Great drinks. Of course!,5
"This place was so good! I can't wait to go there again this June! Wait staff was very prompt and helped us with everything! Oh and their margaritas are beyond delicious, did not skimp on the alcohol at all!",5
Our server was on point.  The food is decent at best and comes with a 5-star price tag.  Go somewhere else!!  No need to keep this place in business...it's garbage.,2
"Miss the pre-covid version of the bar, where you mingled and had so much fun, but still the best drinks on the strip..",4
"In a word, FUN!!! The atmosphere is lively, the food is good, & the drinks are even better.  If you want to feel like you've been transported from the middle of the desert to the middle of the Caribbean, pop into Margaritaville.  They have a broad range of margaritas & other boat drinks & beer but, can expertly whip up anything else you might desire.  John, Joe, Adam, & the rest of the bartenders are some of the best on the strip.  We've enjoyed their concoctions & witty conversation for several years & will keep going back anytime we're on Vegas!",5
Very fun atmosphere and a show while you are eating food was delicious definitely recommend the chicken strips,5
Won't be going back. Was very disappointed with the food. I ordered the chicken and broccoli Alfredo. Not quite sure what the sauce was but it definitely was not Alfredo. Was so bad I only had a few bites. The wait staff seemed to avoid our table when they noticed that I was not eating my meal. They are currently only offering a very reduced menu which is not reflected on the website.,1
Great meal... service was to my satisfaction.,4
Food was kk but not for the price,3
Poor booth lighting but food & drinks were great,4
Volcano nachos and margaritas! Huge plate of food to share. Perfect location next to the Flamingo. Guy on stilts there entertaining kids at another table. Fun friendly atmosphere. Great music.,5
Dave the bartender was great.,5
Great food and drinks and the servers were amazing,5
Great food and service !  Bartenders were even better,5
Always enjoy this place.,5
I'm a Jimmy Buffett fan... and was disappointed!,4
"Good food, but check drink prices. I had a $12.00 for a Grey Goose and cranberry.",3
Very good volcano nachos,4
My first time in Vegas today and the food and drinks were great as well as the costumer service.,5
Enchiladas are so good,5
"Convenient strip restaurant. You know the guy, so you know the menu. Outstanding service",5
The restaurant was very clean and nice inside. The reason why i gave low score is prices for food and drinks are way too high. Ice tea no liquor is 10.00. Way overpriced on everything. I went once and that was good enough for me. If prices weren't so high I would go back.,2
Cute decor with sea animals and the floor looks like water! & of course they have delicious drinks!,5
Considering the covid thing service was great!,5
Love this restaurant! I come here every year when I come to Vegas! Excellent food and really fun entertainment! Its always a lot of fun with short waiting times. Would definitely recommend for a fun day or night out!,5
We love Margaritaville and try to go to it when in the area every where  we go. Food and atmosphere are always good......love it.,5
"This is a fun place with a great menu! The service was incredible.  We didn't ask for a thing because our server was so attentive. You can see people walking up and down the strip if you get seated by the windows. I would recommend the fish and chips, fish tacos, and Cuban sandwich.  They were all great!",5
"Great atmosphere, food and of course Margaritas!",5
This is a great restaurant if you want to meet up with friends in a casual environment. The service was good and the salads were excellent.,4
This is one of my favorite restaurants. I visit every location I can. The service and food is always excellent. It has laid back vibes and makes you feel like you are temporarily transported to a tropical destination.,5
The cocktails are good. They have $6 margaritas.,4
"Walked across the street from Caesars palace for a burger and a margarita with some friends. Place was clean and more importantly cool. Service was good. The margarita was very good (hard to build a brand if there weren't), but I was disappointed in there cheese burger. Almost had a pre-padded frozen look and taste to it. If I go back, I will not get another burger.",3
Great food. Good drinks. Atmosphere was fun.,5
"Service is Great! Food it's Great!!!  I will keep going to Margaritaville, every time I can! Loved it!!  😃",5
Great 👍 place love all  Margaritaville Restaurants that I all ways go to !!!!!!! Here in Vegas and South Carolina!!!!!,5
Margarita was great wings were awesome.,5
"Strip location.  My group of 4 was seated quickly.  The fish tacos were great.  We had a tableside photo taken that is one of my favorite souvenirs from Vegas.  We've been here twice, and will probably go again if we ever return to Vegas.",4
"After a long day of meetings, I came here with friends.  It was about 5:30 and we had a 20 minute wait.  I walked through the restaurant to use the restroom and noticed that about half the tables were empty while we were waiting.  There was a show going on at the time and the music was loud.  The show consists of Jimmy Buffet songs, a pirate on stilts and a mermaid on stilts and then a dancer on the volcano who sacrifices herself to the blender. When the show isn't on, the characters on stilts wander through the restaurant and offer balloon animals and such to the kids.

Our group wasn't very hungry but had a coupon for a free margarita with food and so we ordered the Volcano nachos and pretzels.  The nachos were massive!! I don't remember if we even finished them and we eat like fat kids most of the time.  The gentlemen ordered flights of margaritas, and I had their basic Who's To Blame margarita. The Who's to Blame margarita was part of the flight and after tasting them all we all agreed it was the best of the flight.

The nachos were good, pretty standard and so were the pretzels.  All enjoyable and I do remember finishing the pretzels.",4
Love this place can't wait to go back,5
Very good food. We eat there every time we visit Las Vegas,5
"I didn't eat at the Vegas location the last time I went, but I have ate at the Gulf Shores location and it rocks!!",4
"This place is incredible in EVERY WAY!! The drinks and food and employees are equally amazing!! I go here EVERY time, I go to Vegas, wouldn't miss it!! ...and the Margaritaville store that's attached is VERY cool!!  ""Its 5 o'clock somewhere' merchandise is adorable!! Also, I set my wallet down by accident at a till, but had to go to another till, and thought it was GONE, but went back a few hours later, and woolah, the employees had it!! ...and couldn't call me because, I NEVER LEFT A PHONE NUMBER IN IT!! DUH!! I had quite a bit of money in it, credit cards etc etc, and everything was still in it!! SO IMPRESSED!!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!! I wish you all nothing but the best!!",5
We had blast sitting at the bar!,5
"Although their specialty is Margaritas, I did not find anything special in them, only the price they made me richer than the ones they give you at the Venetian Casino for free",2
"Ahhh! Beautiful local in a suggestive place. Straight on strip! As an Italian tourists, I recommend to have a dinner over there. Fantastic ribs, steak and fish. Use taxi, don't drive because the bartenders will prepare very good drinks before and after eating.",4
"Love this place,  we always head here for beer n food. We did notice this past 4th of July weekend when we ordered our typical volcano nachos they weren't even CLOSE to being as big as the volcano nachos use to be so that was disappointing, especially since we took our friends n there family for the first time to feed everyone",4
For Vegas can't beat $3 drafts.  Very friendly service.,5
"Strip prices and terrible food quality. $16 for egg rolls. Unbelievable!
The waitress was very nice though. She got my order out quickly as I was a joiner to a large group. However, she got my drink wrong.  My food was properly received.",5
Great service and food is good as always!,5
Great food had the fish tacos they were awesome,5
"Server was terrific. The food wasn't. If I'm spending $60 on lunch, I want something good. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip which was fine. Nothing special, but it was edible.  We also ordered a cheeseburger. The bun was cold, the cheese wasn't melted and the meat was just warm. The fries were OK.  We told the server who told the manager who didn't bother to come talk to us. As much as we enjoy Jimmy's music and the previous experiences we had here, we won't hurry back.",2
Great customer service. The food was fresh and during Happy Hour you can enjoy some of their best drinks at a decent price.,5
"I really liked it, I had the shrimp and grits and it was yummy, fun atmosphere and fast service",5
We always make a stop here while cruising the strip. Great for people watching with okay food. I wish the beer selection was better.,4
A really good breakfast.,5
We sat in the bar area and the waiter was great. He was friendly and efficient. The margarita was perfect. My food was nice and hot. My boyfriend's sweet potato fries were Luke warm :( we didn't want to complain so he ate them like that.,4
Great staff! Very Good Food!,5
Great service and the Margaritas are amazing,5
Chris is really good at his job!,5
A bit dated but good staff. Portions were large. Loved the volcano nachos. There are probably better places to go but it's still worth a visit.,3
"Not very impressed.  We went in through what I think must be their back entrance.  Dark and in need of updating.  I'm guessing the front of the place from the strip must be a better side to eat on.  Service was quite slow even though it wasn't busy, and food was basic.  Margarita was good, but basic.",3
Great food and mostly good and helpful staff. Nothing special. Big portions and good margaritas. Lots of decorations in the good way. Clean and spacious toilets. Good location in Flamingo hotel.,4
Wonderful place.... Love it 😍,5
"A bit dated. More about getting you in and out and less about the service.

Today I had someone from the management team at Margaritaville reach out over my review. It was nice to see a company care about the customer. Based on there feed back next time we are in Vegas we will venture into their restaurant. I'm sure things will be different.",3
Fun and delicious as always!,5
"We got coupons for free margaritas when we bought $20 of food or more. Once I ordered my drink (a margarita) I was told AFTER that the free drink was for lime margaritas only. I wish the waitress had explained that since she saw our coupons when we sat down. The food was okay, really nothing to write home about. I found the drinks to be heavy on the alcohol and the Caesar salad seemed to be drenched in vinegar and didn’t taste that good. This wasn’t one of our better experiences for food in Vegas.",2
Bartenders are visits!! Drinks are strong.  Good job guys!!,5
"Margaritas were great, food was overpriced but it's the strip so there's that.",4
Good food.  Fun atmosphere!,4
"Great food and great service! We loved it. Plus, it has a really cool atmosphere. We will definitely come back, the next time we are in Vegas. .",5
First time there the food was vary Good,5
Love this place should have been going hear the whole time I was in Vagas,5
First time here we loved the food and drinks great atmosphere,5
Slow service.  But good food,2
Nice place,5
Only place I'll go on the strip for a strawberry margarita,5
Very similar to a hard rock/ rainforest cafe type of experience.  Fun environment!,5
Great volcano nachos. Glad they are able to open safely.,5
"Great customer service, great place for family",5
Fun place.,5
First time eating there good atmosphere great food.,5
"Always love this place!! A little different, of course, due to COVID. No more people on stilts, girls sliding from the volcano into the giant blender and they don't serve the 100 oz of drink BUT we did get seated by the bar and just enjoyed our drinks and we were greatful for that cuz we already ate🥰",5
Decent prices and good food. Loved the bartender.,4
"Had excellent service, great food and a fascinating atmosphere and",5
"Went there for food, and that was probably my mistake. Everything was dry and lacking flavor. Had a burger, friends had nachos and wings. No thanks.",1
One great place.,5
"Nice atmosphere, good drinks.  I had fun there.",4
"An outdated fad that hasn't been able to update their lame attempt at grabbing wanderers attention since opening. They've removed attractions and downgraded to budget cover bands on a Saturday night. Sharing an appetizer will cost you $30, minus the drinks. The only saving grace is the $15 perfect margaritas and the extremely helpful staff. Not a matter of service, solely a neglect in quality of product/service",2
Got to try the It's 5 o'clock somewhere,5
Jambalaya was pretty good but my tropical fruit margarita was soooooo good! Service was fast and our service was great. I definitely would return.,5
Good ambiance and their service was great. Staffs were friendly and attentive. The foods were presentable and was really great. Prices were fair too. It was totally worth the visit.,5
"Great location! The service was good and the food was very good. They offer a complimentary post card with your photo and at the same time offer a $25 photo in a paper frame. It was a great photo and the frame was a nice way to remember our trip so we purchased it.

""Your Property, Our Priority""",5
Good food and drink. Kid friendly in Las Vegas! They had staff on stilts making balloon hats for kids. We've been here three times and each time the wait is over 30 minutes so be prepared to wait. The kitchen does close late night for you late night folk. The Volcano Nachos are good and HUGE; Perfect for sharing.,4
"Great service.  Great price for Vegas.  Love the atmosphere.  Fish, boats, and beer.  Can't go wrong.",5
Great  place  and  good  breakfast,4
"Service wasn’t good. Nobody came to check on us very disappointed in and out within hour for $100+.

Ordered a drink with 151 rum couldn’t taste the alcohol. My wife ordered a different drink tasted the alcohol. Come on 151 is very strong.

Expensive drinks with very little alcohol in it.

Food was just OK.

Jimmy needs to step it up in the service business.",2
Very friendly but you need to chill out about the mandating mask,5
"Great food, super atmosphere, and reasonably priced!",5
"My family and I loved Margaritaville! The kids especially loved the free balloon animal and the balloon makers were dressed in mermaid outfits, pirate outfits, etc ON stilts! Yes, the balloon makers were super tall on stilts and amazingly wonderful and patient. We had the mermaid and she was an absolute jewel. 5 out of 5 stars for the entertainment alone. Our server was wonderful, fast, send very kind. The food was great! The margaritas were great too.",5
One of the Best places we've been to in Vegas! Highly recommend,5
Food was horrible. I was so disappointed. Staff was great but that's all. Skip this place,2
"I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant. I first experienced Margaritaville in Orlando. When I learned that there was one in Vegas I knew I had to go, now we have a must visit restaurant everyone we are in Vegas. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fun and relaxed. I always go with the ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"" can't go wrong with a classic.",5
Cute tropical decor and fun music videos to watch on huge screens. I ordered the pork ribs entree which was simple yet tasty.  Although the mashed potatoes were a bit bland. Needed some fresh parsley and paprika on top. Ordered a side dinner salad and for $6.99 they should make sure to get rid of the day old lettuce I found in it. The service was good and my foodserver was very attentive.,4
Good service! Terrible margaritas!,3
"Good atmosphere. Favorite drink was the Bama Breeze. Due to the pandemic, they have the drinks in to-go cups but small. The drinks in my opinion should be in regular cups just like the water as it would be the same size as regular glassware when available
Service wasn’t the best. Waitress came and took orders. Dropped food then that’s it. No checkbacks or anything",3
Food and drinks were good! And Mondo was a great waiter!,5
"Went here in late March 2019-it was busy and even with reservations we had to wait a few minutes, but the food was amazing and well worth it! Thanks  for having a good gluten free selection!! The service was great and our waitress always made sure we were looked after.",5
I really enjoy eating at Margaritaville when I in the area,5
Overpriced. Service and the food was horrible,1
Food as always was just ok but the service waa great,3
"Only had a couple drinks o I can't say anything about the food, but the drinks I had were on point.  The bartender was quick and informative.  Heard him talking about the menu to a couple and giving suggestions.  I'd definitely recommend this place.",5
Our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!,5
"We love the atmosphere and normally enjoy going there. However, the chicken sandwich I had was aweful. So tough and thin I could not eat it. Our friends had a hamburger that was looked like mostly bread. A super high price for very poor quality food. It's a shame it is not the same quality as your other restaurants through out the nation",1
We had breakfast and the food was served hot and promptly.  Our waiter Jarod did an awesome job with a busy as he was.  Thank you for the great service.,5
"We love this place!  It has a great atmosphere and decor. Lots of fun. We ordered appetizers and margaritas.  The appetizers were very yummy and they make a mean margarita! Very upbeat, friendly bartender.  Wish we had one of these where we live.",5
We came in with a large group at lunch and they were amazing. The food was delicious. Great service,5
Great Margaritas! And the atmosphere is very laid-back. Looking forward to the food being delicious.,5
1st time here and it was a nice experience!,5
The nachos. That's all.,5
"Food was ok. Nothing to rave about.

Pricey. Expected in Vegas",4
"Food and service was great, prices a little pricey. As expected from vegas",4
Awesome  food and drinks .,5
Rude with no customer service skills!,1
"Thr bar atmosphere itself is great but the service, I am appalled. So very rude and very unclear about where to sit. Not busy at all but the server did not get to us for about 20 minutes. Slow service in between. Almost dismissive. The drinks were good, strong.",1
Always a great experience,5
Food was terrible!,1
"Great food, friendly staff",5
"The drinks were great, the fish and chips not so much. They were like large fish sticks. Not quite as good as other similar chains. We had never been there so we thought we would give it a try. The service was good.",3
Loved it,5
Not the same as it used to be. Definitely has died down. They need to revamp this place. My recommendation is offer snacks after 11pm. That's the reason we didn't stay long otherwise we would have stayed longer because we were hungry and ended up going to inn and out.,1
Great atmosphere 👌... fabulous House Margaritas and great customer service!!!!,5
"Delicious , great service and ambiance",5
"Food was alright, i had a burger and eggrolls for an appetizer. The eggrolls tasted like they dumped the whole bottle of salt in them, but the manager made it right for us. The music also was very loud, could barely hear eachother talking!! Our waitress was wonderful and we loved the margaritas.",4
"Good service. Good food. Just what you'd expect from margaritaville. I wish they would come to Columbus Ohio. The prices are too high though. This one had a dancing mermaid and pirate on stilts and a girl who went down a slide into a ""blender"" in a bikini. That was interesting ;)",5
"Food was nothing short of poor and disappointing. Atmosphere and drinks were good. Overall, not a good experience and would certainly not return.",2
"Place is very disorganized. Don't bother trying to charge anything to your room, their computer is always down for some reason. Good Nachos, a double portion for about $20. The bartenders are rude, but rude is the standard in Las Vegas, not the exception. The job market has never been good in that City so one would think people would be greatful for a decent paying job, and all of those jobs are on the strip.. otherwise 8 bucks an hour.",2
"Great place, fun atmosphere. Lots to see, very clean. We had nice wait staff. Cold beer! I should have ordered the volcano nachos, they looked so good, I kick myself for not trying them. I will definitely go back.",5
"Excellent service, the margaritas Rocked my world!  Great food!  Try the seafood Mac and cheese!  Its Amazing!",4
"They never answer their phones, can't make reservations, drove all the way out there just to find out it's an hour wait at 9am. Really? Don't try calling this place, they'll never answer.",2
Great food. Good beer on tap. Fun atmosphere. Even caught some cool live music during our meal! Excellent service by all the crew. Beachy vibes.,4
The service was good but the food wasn't. We ordered two orders of fish tacos and they were missing the sauce (which is an important ingredient) and it took a while for them to cook them. Better to pay for a buffet.,2
"The Margaritaville in Vegas is awesome! Margaritas on point, especially the Perfect Margarita. Fish tacos were lit! Tammy our server was beyond excellent. Great experience. Great food.",5
"Awesome food and drinks. Cool environment. Stuff was excellent. Also convenient location.
Parking is hard being it's on the strip.",5
This restaurant is amazing all the way around. The staff is super polite and the music and atmosphere are great. The menu is full of delicious food options. This restaurant is also kid friendly. A great place to eat to avoid the heat on the strip!,5
Good food workers nice,5
"Great restaurant but this will likely be the last time I come here.  I've been hosting numerous large business meetings here for years, but now there is no now volcano show!!!  My dollars and large expense account will be spent elsewhere in the future",3
"Fun place to stop in for lunch or dinner. I've eaten here several times over the last 10 years or so, and the food has always been good. The atmosphere is fun, but the service is average. When I ate there yesterday I noticed my both was in need of being fixed up. The ""white"" seat cushion was no longer white, and it was badly worn. Other portions of the booth were pretty bad too.",3
"Good food! Great service! Wonderful entertainment. Love this place. If your in Vegas head to Margaritaville for great margaritas, n a good time.",5
Absolutely love stopping here every time im in town. Bartenders are the best in Las Vegas!,5
"Loved it! Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere...what's not to love?! Some of the booths are fishing boats! Incredible experience. 🙂",5
Great food and service,5
"Bartenders were friendly, knowledgeable and the margaritas were awesome. They also gave us some tips on hidden wonders in the area.",5
Place was very. Busy,3
"Food was surprisingly good for what one might consider a chain restaurant.

However, the service left a bit to be desired. Took a while for them to come around and take our order, and the waiter provided the minimum amount of service, barely ever coming by to ask how the food was or fill water.

It's a decent place to stop, but don't expect perfection",4
I love this place! Good food! Great location and great margaritas 👍,5
Not enough food options,4
Great atmosphere.  Had jerk salmon. Absolutely delicious. Great customer service.  A great place to watch sports games.,5
Me and my boyfriend always stop by the bar when we walk down the strip and have a great time! Bartenders are friendly and fast even when it’s busy. The margaritas are delicious and you definitely get your moneys worth. Hang out and play some video blackjack and enjoy the environment. You won’t regret it!,5
"Way crowded, but for being on the strip one should expect nothing less. Very limited craft beer selection, but bartender made a stiff cocktail! Great location and VERY live vibe. I strongly urge all to visit this place. It's VEGAS BABY!",4
"Really good restaurant and bar. Awesome, friendly staff that treated us right. Classic margaritas are the best.",5
"We enjoyed our meal. The coconut shrimp was great! My husband had ribs and he said they were the best ever. The service was top notch.
The guys even surprised me with a balloon hat.",5
"The cheeseburger in paradise is still one of my favorite burgers anywhere.  They have fabulous gluten free buns.

The nachos are outstanding also.  And don't forget the drinks, what's a visit without a margarita?  The blueberry pomegranate was sooo good!

They were doing some renovations while we were there so some of the seating was shut down.  Even with that, we didn't have a terribly long wait.",5
A pretty good place for some damn good margaritas,4
Awesome Great service and Drinks. Bartenders took good care of our 21 year old Daughter and her best friend.,5
"Food was not cooked well, and the entire area was dirty. The only thing going on good there were the waitresses were nice. Prices were high and the special event had the wrong date posted on the special event.",1
Great environment delicious food.,5
"Good food,  great service",5
"Great place for a low key party of 25 people. Drinks and food came fast, and music was no louder than people could still talk.",5
Food is awesome. Great place to go on the strip😁😁,5
Miss the Mermaid,4
Couldn't find the salt shaker...,4
Good drinks but very sweet...,4
Always good place get the nachos,5
The Best burgers and Buffalo wings on the strip. Margaritas are the very best. Love this place.,5
Yummy Margaritas and a great bar to sit and talk with friends.  A nice place to rest and cool off after walking all over Vegas! Nice atmosphere and good service.,5
Very great experience,5
Great service!,5
"If you've read any of my restaurant reviews you know I LOVE cheeseburgers. I had one of the most tasty one's ever here in Vegas. It was HUGE. I couldn't even eat it all, but every bite came with a splash of flavor I proudly reminisce. It was put together well. Not sloppy. The loss of a point was due to an entire seating section being roped off, forcing us to be near the stage and a live performance. My group wanted a bit more of an intimate area, but the band was on point that night in my opinion!",4
"I wanted to like it and have fun, afterall what could be better than having a margarita at Jimmy Buffett's?  To be honest I found the decor kind of tacky and I didn't get a warm feeling there; to top it off the food was only mediocre. The saving grace was our waitress, she was great.",3
The booths are cool,5
Nice place to eat. Be sure to have a margarita.,5
Had a lot of fun wasting away in Margaritaville! We went just for margaritas and appetizers and they were good. Didn't try any of the rest of menu because we were bar hopping. Loved the atmosphere and had a blast!,4
Oh my god! The Jambalaya is heaven. The service is great! I definitely would recommend coming back!,5
Food was really good!! Our server was really nice and it's worth it just to try it once!! It's a fun place to eat in.,4
this place was ok not supper sold on the drinks small and very pricy,3
Excellent service and great food,5
Staff was very friendly and food came out fast. Volcano nachos were excellent. Margaritas were very tasty. Definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!!,5
"Great restaurant,  good food, great staff and run atmosphere. Reasonably priced.",5
Gosh this is hard to say but this place just doesn’t have good food anymore!! Over priced and very poor quality. Makes me sad. Go in for drinks and atmosphere but don’t eat!,2
"Our experience was terrible. We talked multiple times about how customer service was so great in Vegas and how Everyone was so nice but that wasn’t the case here. Our waitress was so rude and dismissive and not friendly at all. We would be midsentence talking to her and she would walk away she caught an attitude multiple times. Her name was Pam S. Since I’m reviewing their service I must say that their food wasn’t very good either, it’s pricey and the quality is terrible. Everything is pretty much bland and you’re paying an extreme amount of money when you could go somewhere else, spend the same amount, and eat much better tasting food. Overall I won’t be going back",2
"Just stopped in for drinks. Had a good time. We were going to do the nickel beers, but it gets super crowded I guess, and it's Miller light, so we just did the normal happy hour margs. It was definitely a mix, but they use agave tequila, so it was enjoyable and NOT going to make me sick. The bartenders were great!",4
"You can always find a great burger and Landshark Lager on tap. One of my required stops on the Strip. Prices are reasonable and servers are friendly. Merch is pretty costly, but that's not really a surprise.",5
I love it here everything food and service,5
Such an awesome restaurant! Love the Margaritaville theme and the food just as much! Drinks are amazing and the price is pretty decent for the strip we had two drinks and our meals and it was about $70 with tip well worth it!,5
"I definitely miss the 5 O'clock Somewhere Bar(and definitely missing the flair!)...... But the new layout is more restaurant focused and better for a dinner out with a group; but  the Bird Bar is kinda pointless now... it's not anything positive of the old or the new.

Edit: On the very next trip, the front doors are locked at 11:15 when posted closing is Midnight..... What?? All we wanted was some nachos after walking the strip for a while.... I don't understand that decision.",1
"The upstairs patio is such a nice view of the Blvd. only drink tho, no food. We shared the fried pickles, chicken wings, and appetizer sampler. I loved everything but the egg rolls. They were definitely not like a traditional egg roll...my boyfriend had a perfect Margarita and my mom has a fins to the left. They were both better than my watermelon margarita which was suuuuper sweet. Would get a regular one next time. Our waiter was nice, and he let us know about all the deals. We got a complimentary picture as well.",4
"Food did not disappoint. Bar staff at odds of when Happy Hour was in effect, but it was figured out eventually.  Great visit as always!",4
"A smile and friendly attitude goes a long way. The rough, mean female bartender in the back area bar lacked both and more.",1
Came expecting Jimmy Buffett experience  with only one song played in couple hours there. Ambiance is not particularly good. Much better places around for the price,3
Huge menu with something for everyone. Had a large group and was sat quickly. Fun drinks and fun atmosphere. Great for family's or all adults. To go drinks available.,5
"Pros: Fun to sit on the third floor and people watch!
Waitress was super nice, although very busy! But being a server myself I understood why it was sometimes slow!
Lava shrimp are so yummy! 100% recommend!

Cons: Not worth the price... at all! So expensive for extremely sub par food. You can head over to Senor Frogs for better food and drinks for cheaper prices and sit outside over the Treasure Island Pirate Show.
They advertise 5 cent beers from 5-6 daily, but it is only Monday through Friday, and it’s at the bar in the casino not the restaurant!
Not super clean, every bathroom besides one stall was closed!

Will I go back?? No, but the experience was fun and iconic to eat at the famous restaurant!",3
"My girls love this place. Definitely more fun than the same one at Universal studios, CA.  Pirates on stilts can make pretty much anything with balloons. A fun, family friendly place to take the kids especially if you need to have a good gluten free selection for your kids with a wheat allergy. We do not have Celiac so not sure about cross contamination in the kitchen.",5
"Great place, excelent service good food. taking all precautions taking social distancing seriously.",4
Pretty awesome place. This was my 1st time being there. The food was good. The drinks were refreshing. We went when it was not busy. We did not have to wait long. The staff was very friendly and we enjoyed our time being at this restaurant to our trip to Vegas!,5
Food and service was exceptional.,5
Awesome house margarita for a good price,5
It was our first time there and we waited 30 minutes to get in and waited a hour for our food to come out it was like they forgot about  us service was awful and food was not so great for the wait .,2
I love Margaritaville.  They have the best burgers here.  The drinks are good too.,5
Love this place. Whenever I am back in Vegas I  will go back. Great food and prices!,5
The service was great.  We had a long night of partying so we grabbed something light.  I had the shrimp appetizer which was a big hit and a salad. Round 6pm they have a show involving the volcano that runs every hour. Of course they have a photographer and if you let them know the special occasion they will add it to your photo.,4
If you like margaritas. 3rd floor is open. Views of popular part of strip.,4
Good food and cold beer.,5
Great service from Tammy and amazing specials!!,5
A great experience. I wish I could eat there more,5
Every time we go it's so much fun! Breakfast is great.  Volcano nachos are unbelievable.,5
Great service and awesome cajun grits and shrimp,5
I was impressed. Fun decor feels like you are eating in a boat. Good family vibe. The Volcano Burger was pretty tasty. The server was attentive and friendly.,4
The chicken is great. The line is always super long which sucks. Delivery never works so I wouldn't be able to get food unless I go in person. The staff is very friendly and it's verY clean inside the place.,3
I think what makes this place so special is the name. It was a cool place to visit and something you have to do at least once  but I'm not sure I would go back again. Food was good and so where the drinks but nothing that really hits you to come back. The entire restaurant is decorated in a boat theme which is awesome and the staff was very friendly.,3
Great yummy food and amazing bar tenders!! Highly suggest going there!!,5
"Was ok, issue was waitress trying to keep a $30 tip instead of bringing me the change. She was good but not that good. To had would of been 5 star if not for her!",3
Good food good atmosphere,4
"A group of 25 of us went ( with a reservation) for a post -wedding + 21st b-day meal and drinks. Balloon artists dressed as pirates went around making balloon animals for the bday guy and the bride and groom. Food was good, we had chicken and burger's.  Drinks were great,  but a bit pricey $10-15/ea. Service was good ( we had 2 for our big table) and the place was packed (it was Saturday night) . It was the ambience that made this place wonderful.",5
Amazing food and margaritas,5
Stopped in to have a margarita after seeing they had 6.00 margaritas. Asked the bartender for 2 and ended up gettinf 2 of their 12.00 margaritas. Oh well they were pretty good. Neat spot for sure.,4
"It was ok.. Highly expensive for what little food you get. There were many other restaurants at the same price or less with better portions. If your just going for the bar it's probably worth it, but I wouldn't recommend dining in.",2
"Horrible is an understatement. This place used to be awesome years ago and we always made an effort to eat here at least once during each stay in Vegas.
But on our last visit, the hostess was extremely rude to all of the customers and she was more interested in complaining as loudly as possible about the other employees rather than actually helping the customers. When we ordered our food, the waiter brought out our entrees with the paper receipts sitting on top of the food!

This place is way too overpriced for the poor service and low quality food. Next time, we'll just listen to Jimmy Buffett and make our own margaritas and save a hundred bucks.",1
"The other 2 levels are always closed also they're always understaffed... Bad service.
Margaritas were alright, 3 out of 10 pure sugar. Walked 30 minutes to wait 30 for water to wait another 30 minutes for my food. Overpriced appetizers and truth be told. For the Margarita price your better off getting that margarita tower off the strip for 3 more dollars",1
"Was there twice in the last three days (dinner, then breakfast) and received excellent service, wonderful meals, and an enjoyable experience both times! 👍👍👍👍👍",5
"An enormous plate of nachos, easily enough (more than actually) two people. The signature margaritas were strong & delicious as well. My only complaint was the service. I asked for no guacamole on the nachos, but got it anyway.",4
Amazing food and margaritas,5
Great food and drinks,5
"Very fun, laid-back atmosphere.  Excellent restaurant with great food and reasonable prices.  Very nice gift shop.  However, recommend you try on any clothes before you buy.",5
"Fun atmosphere and large meal portions. We got the fish and chips with spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer. Gave 4 large pieces of fried fish and nice serving of fries and I had the sweet potato waffle fries.  It also came with coleslaw that was ok, but I'm more of a fan of a sweet creamy slaw.  Staff was friendly and helpful as well.",5
"So disappointed....  Came here for drinks with my friends at 1:30 in the afternoon.  Went to roof top bar and waited ten minutes for drinks and ended up leaving without anything.
One bar tender only and he did not seem that experienced.  Over eight people waiting in line for drinks...
Need to be staffed better.",1
Cool environment,3
"Appetizers were great!!! The main course Not so much! Crab cakes were nothing too spectacular...Ribs were tough, and the mashed potatoes could be better",3
Very good.. good food and atmosphere,4
Overpriced food and drinks. Slow service. My spinach dip came with the chips from the bottom of a bag. 5 whole chips all the rest were small pieces. For $14. Careful what you order. Jambalaya was very small portion. Cup of soup for $18. Will not be back,2
"Had good drinks here, staff was fairly friendly and fast.",4
Great nachos!!,5
"Food and service were awesome, great price.",5
I had the best time here. I still dream about their seafood mac and chesse. I'm so glad I went to a place that was very country and made me feel right at home. The staff was friendly and nice. The music was good and the food was amazing.,5
Bottomless mimosas and you got your money's worth out of them! We didn't want to eat at a chain we could eat near us but we just got off the plane and the hotel said we couldn't check in for three hours. We walked around the hotel for a bit and came here. It was a great decision. The server was amazing and very friendly. My wife with Celiac's had no problem finding gluten free options and the food was amazing. No disappointment here and we'd be happy to come back. Did I mention bottomless mimosas?,5
Great place stopped in for drinks and an appetizer at the bar tables...  great mixed drinks great crab dip and a wonderful server named Sean he was the best give him a raise....  ECP,5
Nice place to eat while in Vegas,5
This is always a top place to visit with my family any time we are in Vegas. Great food and amazing service. The restaurant has a great atmosphere with some fun music. The food menu is huge and I love that its attached to the flamingo.,5
"Always a blast.  Try the blueberry pomegranate margarita, it is delicious!!  I had the jambalaya which was pretty good :)  They had a live band going and our server kept the drink coming.  Friendly staff and clean bathrooms.",5
Had a great time here,5
"We just ate here and the food was good except for my husband's steak.  Ordered it medium, came back so well-done he had to put in some effort just to cut through the meat.  Tasted like it was microwaved; very dry and no taste.  We didn't have time to return it and wait for a new steak. Stick to seafood if you come here.",3
Good food and we were lucky to have a great waiter.,5
Amazing crab and artichoke dip. We went on a really busy Friday night so there was a wait but the bar had open seating and we got something right away. The jambalaya and seafood are delicious!,5
"Here for our anniversary and came over for lunch. It is a clean place, not very crowded at the noon hour. Seated right away. Our waitress was wonderful and we were served quickly. The low score is due to the food and drinks. If you are looking for tart and sour, go for the mango margarita. It was so tart. (The traditiial margarita is good though). The burger and fish tacos were lack luster to say the least. Even with the sauces that come on both dishes, it lacked flavor and seasoning. The burger looked like it was previously frozen and pressed (and for $18, that was more than disappointing). The side salad might as well have been out of a bag of salad from the grocery store. The fish tacos were very bland and the sauces were rather flavorless. And at the end, it was horribly over priced. Not going to lie, I will not be coming back and I definitely will advise friends to spend their money elsewhere.",1
This place is awesome the employee or very good and polite and the food is good,5
"The waitress was awesome.  I went here for my 50th birthday.  It was the only restaurant I for sure wanted to visit.  I was so disappointed in the food.  My husband and I both got the Cheeseburger in Paradise.  It wasn't bad.  But my husband makes a better elk burger.  It was nothing special.  We had  about 9 of us and some of the other plates looked pretty good. But once again, nothing special.  I guess my expectations were pretty high because I am a die hard Parrot Head.  I was disappointed the food was so blah.",2
Breakfast! Who knew? Really good menu in wonderful Margaritaville atmosphere. Service is excellent,5
Great food at a reasonable price. Refreshing Margaritas in a relaxing atmosphere. Staff are friendly and helpful.,4
"DayLynn was excellent!  Very professional, friendly, and accomodating!",5
Best restaurant for the simple fact that they are only place you can get loaded landsharks and the best margaritas. Also happen to have great food. I recommend the fish and chips!,5
Always happy at Margaritaville. WE had a shift change while we were there and both servers we excellent. Our cups remained full and they made sure we didn't need anything often.,5
"Its ok. Seems a bit more like a kids restaurant inside and not an ""on the strip"" restaurant.",3
BEST food!!!,5
It's 5 o'clock!,5
"I recently visited Margaritaville and the service Ryan gave us was outstanding, plus the food the atmosphere  everything is excellent. If you planning to visit Vegas this a must place to eat at and request Ryan aka The Best*****",5
"Your average over priced food in Vegas. The restaurant itself is decorated very fun and makes for a fun experience for kids. However, the food isn't anything special to say the least. I ordered the fish tacos. They were almost $20 and left me thinking "" why did I just spend $20 to set next to a fake palm tree.""",3
My family and I go every time we are in vegas. This time our waiter Jared was amazing. He went above and beyond. Great food and good service.,5
"We had several gift certificates so selection was like eating your free. The decor is nice, location is great, people were nice. The dinner meals were poor and probably the worst house margarita we've had in a long time. Didn't even finish it. However, the breakfast on the last day was fantastic. Big portions and cooked well. The Key West omelet was a great way to close out our Margaritaville experience here in Vegas.",3
"Blah, not so good.",2
"Cool place.  Went at 10:30 at night after just arriving in Las Vegas.  Dinner took way too long (at last an hour) and it was not busy at all.  The waitress said she told her manager (we didn't even complain) and they offered us 2 free margaritas on the house.  That was nice.  Sirloin steak was very good, juicy, and tender.  Mashed potatoes were good, broccoli was way undercooked. I'd go back again.",4
"Had the three asada tacos . They are horrible,    No taste. Tortillas are soggy",1
Cheeseburger in Paradise.,5
"I had the chicken fried steak and it was good, the mashed potatoes were great. My friend had the teriyaki chicken and he said it was good. The look of the restaurant is pretty cool with an island. There is some old style music kind of upbeat. It's a overall chill restaurant. They have a 15% military discount. We did not try the drinks but they did look good. Service was average.",4
"Terrible hostesses!! If I owned this company I would be appalled at the staff greeting customers and guiding the experience they’re about to have. It felt like we were an inconvenience to be coming there for lunch. Place was not busy, especially for middle of the day, spring break time. Food was above average/ good -Southwest Salad and Chicken Fajitas. The first server we had wasnt friendly either, but we had a second sever come in and say he was taking over after our drink order. He was attentive, friendly and great! Biggest pro: the margarita. Biggest con: laughable customer service, besides end waiter.",3
We waited 15 minutes for someone to wait on us and we eventually walked out. When we told the hostess she offered to get a manager or told us to leave a review on Yelp. At that point we knew they didn't care and weren't customer oriented so it wasn't worth talking to the manager which I'm positive was part of the chatting staff that watched us walk out. I've been to Margaritaville and was really excited for my family to experience this restaurant. Guess not.,1
"Burger and Fries were cooked great. However, way to much salt on burger.",3
Great food and wonderful show,5
"Rude hostess,requested a booth she tried to sit us at a table so we said that we would wait until a booth was available, waited ten minutes then was seated waited another ten minutes for our server no one ever came to our table while multiple servers walked by. We just eventually got up and left. DINNING WHILE BLACK!!!!",1
Good vibe and meal,4
Who wouldn't give Jimmy 5 stars? The fajitas are what to buy.,5
"There's nothing special about it especially when you're in Vegas. The creativity in Vegas is at it's top until you visit Margaritaville. Same standard concept forced into a place that has thousand times more to watch, eat and enjoy. Even the menu is uncreative - ask for a whiskey cocktail and they stare at you like you're from another world. You have tons of other options in Vegas for unique Margaritas.",2
Why bother.,2
Rip off.,1
"Great atmosphere, long wait to get in. Long wait for waiter for ordering and for check. Nice balloon making people and great talent. Food was good (crabcake sandwich is small). Margaritas good too.",4
"I would never eat at this place again my husbands food was cold the service was not great at all the server took forever to come take order for drinks they don’t ply the songs from jimmy buffet anymore on weekends they have live band and dj which  is way too loud u can’t enjoy a conversation with who ever u went with and then they turn the lights out and u can’t see. This is not how I remember it when I last came and for the prices the food better be hot when it comes out the waitress was not any good she took forever to even get our drink order, bring our food and to get our check this is the worst service I’ve had anywhere",1
"Went for breakfast... was expecting a little more, stake was under cooked and they use store bought sausage links. For $15 a plate I expected to get a better quality food. Great atmosphere but breakfast is defiantly lacking.",3
"Great friendly staff, good drinks, but the bar upstairs needs to stay open past 6!! Everyone I know love outside bar atmosphere",4
First time I've ever been and it was amazing! I got the beach club with sweet potato fries and I believe it was the lost mango margarita and loved it all!!,5
I went in 2012 and it was the best experience of my life and I have 3 children. I went again in 2019 and was shockingly disappointed. All they play for music is garbage. 100% different atmosphere. I’ll never go back.,1
"Show is cute and short. Great family place. Nachos are amazing, adults and children loved the drinks. Servers are very friendly",5
Highly recomend.,5
Great atmosphere!,5
It's 5 O'clock somewhere,5
Amazing Restraint. Fun Vibe. Definitely Coming back,5
I love this place.,5
Fun to people watch from the bar. The strawberry margarita was one of the best I've had. Great service too. Only downside was the key lime pie wasn't limey enough for my taste.,4
Love love love love love Margaritaville.....friendly staff and great drinks,5
Love the volcano nachos,5
Great and quick service. Yummy food,5
"Food and drinks are on par with all other establishments.  The issue is the best part of this bar is upstairs with the misters.   It is closed by 11am every day.  This is a prime spot that could bring in a massive amount of revenue and a great night spot for ppl who don't want to club.  But no, they close at 11am no matter what.",3
Ordered $5 well drinks and appetizers. Had a great time for maybe the best value on the strip.,5
"Loved it!! Good people, good food!! Great service!!",5
"Typical strip restaurant.  Crowded, service just okay, menu a bit over-priced but not bad.   Music was good.  Understand these things and it's as good as anywhere else on the strip.",3
"Good food, but the prices just ain't it. Parking was a nightmare, which I know is from the location. Margarita was tasty. Attentive service. They did try to sell us a photo of ourselves mid meal.",4
Waited on appetizers which showed up just prior too main course.  Waitress was more interested in getting us take out boxes than asking if we wanted a second round.  All at 7:30 pm...,2
Decent spot to grab a drink & some food.,3
Always a great time. The nachos are some of the best on the strip along with the crab meat dip. The staff was great too.,4
First time eating here. We had breakfast. Place was empty (strike 1). Prices were high (strike 2). Food was o.k. (strike 3). Server was VERY nice. But not worth going back.,2
Great food!,5
"Went twice. Last Wednesday and Friday nights. First experience was great: great food, drinks, service. Second was not, hence the one star.
Got the coconut shrimp both times, but on the second  night  I did the side of Mac n cheese instead of fries.. the noodles on the top tasted dry with no sauce (noodles on bottom were moist and that’s where the sauce was) I feel like the Mac n cheese was left on the line for a bit longer than it should of been.. two hours later I became incredibly ill. :/
Also on second night my friends dish came with broccoli that looked past its expiration :/",1
Over priced for the tasteless food,2
Wasted away again,5
"Full of orange skinned octogenarians but hey, where else can we go on national Margarita day? Fun atmosphere and drinks were good.",5
Gotta love those volcano nachos and perfect margarita!,4
"A very iconic place to grab margaritas and food. The burgers are great. But I typically order chips, salsa and guac with my margaritas. Happy hour gets pretty happy. And super busy. It is definitely a party atmosphere. If you prefer quiet, this isn't the place for you. Be aware though, that if super busy, they won't honor happy hours at all. This is the one disatisfisfaction that I have personally experienced as those margaritas can get very expensive.",5
Big portions. You can t have it all. Nice ambiens. Waitress was wise enough to tell us that she ll take order for the desert later.probably she knew we wont be able to finish the ordered food.Great place especially happy hours.,5
"Very delicious ‼️‼️

Especially the strawberry margarita 😋😋",5
Don't go for the service. Rooftop great but only half beers available. No food upstairs & God forbid the bartenders down want a carryout order. Service really poor. Worst margaritaville. Really dosnt do franchise good.,1
"Drinks and Lava Lava Shrimp, all very good. Shrimp hot but not too hot. Enjoyable experience.",5
Service is a little slow... but the drinks are worth the wait.  I nice place too cool off and have a margarita mid afternoon.  The music is good as well.,4
"The frozen margaritas were delicious and not watered down! We had a 2for1 deal, so the prices were absolutely ok! Had a good time before going over the street for a dance in Omnia. Not sure about the food, since we only stopped for drinks.",4
"Food was amazing as always.  Staff was good but not great.  Others in my group had to ask for coffee refills...then he came back quite later.  He did not remove our dirty plates  (always a bad mark in my book). He didn't ask if we wanted to take anything to go...even though I'm sure if he was any bit attentive he could see we had tonnes of food leftover.
Nachos are kick-ass.  But we didn't want anything on top other than cheese...and didn't want the creamy cheese at all...just regular shredded cheese but then he charged us $1.50 for extra cheese!!! And didn't change our bill. We tipped...but likely shouldn't have.  More because we left full.
This 4 star is only for the food!",4
Always a good time.,5
We were seated promptly but the waitress took 15 min to get to us. The restaurant was not busy.  She came around the corner like oh been waiting long? She was nice enough but just not “on the job”. We ordered chicken Caesar salads.  The chicken was fine but the lettuce was orange and not fresh. We had to pick around the orange pieces to get good lettuce.  The atmosphere felt empty.,2
Great place to eat and a decent menu. I wasn't blown away by the food but if you can get a spot on the balcony area you get a awesome atmosphere with views down the strip and can even catch the fountain performance just about.,5
Food was great and server was very friendly and accommodating .,5
"Great food. Great service. We had 6 kids, and they were entertained thoroughly by the entertainers there.",5
"Overpriced for what it is. 20 years ago it was cool, now not so much",3
"Atmosphere and service were excellent, and the fried calimari rings were fantastic. On the other hand, the chicken kabob was covered in a spicy-hot sauce - not simply ""roasted"" with a side of sauce, as the menu describes. I tried to cut off the sauce, but there was too much of it. (I would like to mention that both our waiter and a manager offered to get me something else, which brought my review up to four stars instead of three.) For future reference, Margaritaville, either make the food as the menu describes or change the description.",4
"We loved it
Great atmosphere the burger was excellent had a great time. Bought aT-shirt",5
Food was awesome. Drinks not so great for the price,5
"Excellent casual bar and dining experience centrally located on the strip. Staff are polite and helpful, food and drinks are good and prices are reasonable. Some fun bar games offered as well, the main draw to this place is the atmosphere. Gift shop available next door.",5
"Margaritaville never disappoints. I had the Drunken Shrimp Skillet from the apps menu as an entree which was one of the best things I have ever eaten. Fantastic service, music, and atmosphere. Live music stage as well. Although my husband and I wanted more authentic restaraunts on our trip, Margaritaville is always open and doesn't close between lunch and dinner like most of the privately run places in Vegas.",5
"The staff was excellent,  the furnishings was old looking and some wobbly tables, food was good.  Overall the staff and food made the evening very enjoyable.   You have try the ""Perfect Margarita"" excellent.",4
Great as always. The staff and food are absolutely wonderful. A great experience as always.🍻🍻🍻,5
"Food was good. Huge portions. Great drinks. They even have a show with a ""volcanic eruption""  Haha I can't even describe it. It's a good time!",5
Perfect mixed margaritas! Happy is a must.,5
It was very nice  ! Excellent  service  !,5
The band performance awesome! Well known place and good Margaritas.,5
Terrible...find something else to eat.,1
"Great food, drinks and service!!",5
Staff was very friendly. Food was good delicious,5
Didn't live up to the vibe and everything over priced.,3
"The nachos were really good. Other than that, the waitress was rude, the food was expensive and didnt taste very good. The $12 margarita is the smallest I've ever had.",2
Great food and wonderful service,5
"The atmosphere is fun. I've eaten at Cheeseburger in Paradise before and enjoyed it. Margaritaville Las Vegas has dining tables and booths that make it feel like you're eating on the deck of a small fishing boat or a pirate ship. Not sure if it's the same for all Margaritaville locations but it was neat nonetheless. The food was good, however the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl was overly salty and vert runny. Maybe a bad day in the kitchen? I still enjoyed my burger... And will go back.",4
"Fun place to eat with many attractions.  Don't miss the candy shop and candy ""bar"" upstairs as that was something to really see.",4
The cool show they don't do anymore. Really that was the only thing worth going there for.now that its gone and replaced by a big lame blender I won't be going there anymore..,1
Friendly service. Willing to adjust for you needs. Great food. Recommend it!,5
"I liked it, place was packed but to be expected in Vegas... Burger was good little over cooked. I'd go back.",4
"The volcano nachos were perfect. The Who's the Blame margarita tasted great, and the bartenders were friendly.",5
"My wife and I visit Las Vegas a couple times a year. The very first thing we do when we get to Vegas is, head straight to Margaritaville for a few Five 0' clocks. The last few visits have been very disappointing though!  When you're paying that kind of money for four, now weak, drinks, they better be as good as the one we fell in love with. We are returning on April 10th 2019. We're not sure if that will be our first stop and we may not stop at all.",3
Great food. Excellent employees,5
We love the nachos.  The prices are fair for Vegas.  My wife and I were both a little disappointed they got rid of the girl that did her little show.,4
Great food and friendly staff. Will definitely go back,5
"OK, I admit.... I'm a Parrot Head.  And I admit I really enjoyed the corny entertainment, and our table that looked like it was on the back of a sport fishing boat... Corny too.   But despite the pro JB prejudices I had very low expectations for the food.  Wow.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  Possibly the best cheese burger (in Paradise, of course) ever.  Off the charts good. So good. So good.  Don't miss it.  I will be back.",5
"Food was delicious, best quesadilla that I've ever had! Servers were prompt and very friendly. Such a fun part of our vacation.",5
"My bf and I sat on the patio, it was great! Nice atmosphere, outdoor people watching, and relaxing. Food was nothing extraordinary, we ordered breakfast with bottomless mimosas.",4
"Great service sat on the upper deck, love people watching and this was perfect for it. Enjoyed happy hour and some margaritas!",5
I can't come to Vegas & not go to Margaritaville for their monster sized nachos(enough for 3 to 4 people) & of course their Margaritas! There are many food & drink options here so if you're not into nachos & margaritas it's still worth the visit. The music & atmosphere also add to the greatness of the place! It's a Vegas strip must!,5
"Wasting away again in margaritaville.  The margaritas here are fantastic, as they should be. Definitely need to visit while in Vegas. Food is great as well, portions are very large. Unsure of the schedule, but when I was there they had a live band playing as well, which was very fun.  Definitely a must see when you are in vegas.",5
Fun place.,5
The bartender was so fun!,5
Good place to stop and relax your feet and have a beer if you have been walking all day or night,5
Love Margaritaville and this one did not disappoint. Great happy hour.,5
If you haven't been here definitely try it the food is amazing and the servers are super friendly!,5
Over rated,1
"Was very nice, I even got a special hat balloon because it was my birthday!",5
"Great entertainment, food, drinks, and service! Can't go wrong with this place.",5
Nice,5
Iconic margaritaville! Great little merchandise shop inside as well. Must see place in Vegas!,5
"We attended a party for newlyweds and it was fantastic. Great food and drink for the attendees.
Most of all the party was held in a private area in the second floor.",4
"Fun and whimsical place that also has great food in huge portions. Try the iced hot chocolate!
My group was also impressed with the friendly professional staff!",5
"Stopped to get some dinner on a Friday night  and it was busy. They had a live band, which was nice but if you're looking for a quiet dinner at that time I'd suggest something else. Food was good and slightly high priced.",4
Fantastic service and good food. Drinks were great too. Only downside was last call before 1am on a Saturday night. It's Vegas ain't it?,3
"The best place ever, It my new favorite restaurant. Everyone is nice and its kid friendly.",5
Very nice place to hang out with friends. Their updated menu is full of variety.  Clean eating area and washrooms were very clean.Always great service,4
"What's happened to this place?! This used to be a Vegas stable. Admittedly it's been 10yrs since my last visit but this isn't packed anymore. Arrived around 12 I think so maybe the crowed had thinned out a bit, but it was definitely an older crowd 40s+, live music (cool covers band), margarita was too limey, might still be fun with the right crew but we didn't even finish our drinks.",3
"Every time I am in Vegas... I check out Margaritaville in the Famingo... Tonight had the ""Perfect Margarita"" and the coconut shrimp. It was ""perfect""! Codos to bartender Adam Edwards... Left my jacket on the chair and he came and found me in the casino! ""Perfectomundo!""",5
The perfect margarita is the way to go.  The fish and chip a and what I always have always have.  Always good definitely would recommend the plate... But the perfect margarita is theust have drink..,5
Loved the lava shrimp and margaritas. Friendly staff. You can use your total rewards points to pay for meal. Awesome,5
"Great service, great food, great atmosphere!! Got a table on Friday night no problem!!",5
"Service was meh... food was ok
I would eat other places if you are looking for mire than the experience of saying you ate there. I didn’t hate it, just not a place you have to see if you are in Vegas",2
Great food and drinks,5
Always fun and entertaining. Good food and drinks.,5
Siperb liquor and ambience,4
Amanda was amazing. Made our time there so enjoyable!,5
"Had dinner here while in Vegas. This is not the first time we have been there, but it will be the last. We ordered a strawberry margarita which was horrible. We also ordered the burgers in paradise. I ordered no pickles and no sauce, the burger came covered with pickles and a pickle nestled lovingly amongst my fries. Every thing taste like pickles. It was absolutely disgusting.",1
Meal was good. Service was good. Nothing to complain here.,4
Great food and relaxing atmosphere!!,5
Great prices and nice ambiance,5
"5 to 6pm for 5¢ beers. Every night. Yep, you read that right. Then the beers go to like $1 for the rest of happy hour until 7pm. $2 margaritas the whole two hours.",5
Had a great night out there.  I really enjoyed all the mixed tropical drinks they offered.,5
I'd waste away again here.,5
Amazing service! Great place to go for breakfast that's on the strip but not crowded.,4
"Service was good. Burger was good, but fries weren't hot.",4
"First time here and I gotta say it's a great place to visit when your in town. From the customer service, food and drinks I give them 10 stars. Thanks again guys for making this a fun night!",5
Best place to have breakfast and people watch,5
Had my ritual 2 shots of tequila at margaritaville... along with some salsa and chips...mom great! Steak tonite... more gambling later...,5
Excellent food and atmosphere. Great for kids and adults. The volcano nachos are the best!,5
Food was terrible.,2
"Good atmosphere, chill music and good service.
Paid around 80$ for two sandwiches/fries and 2 beers and 2 Margaritas.",4
such a cool atmosphere ... decent food,5
We ordered well over $200 worth of food and drinks including a tower of Margarita and we're only given plastic disposable cups for the margaritas not only is that the epitome of classless but it is also horrible for the environment. After being served the staff was non-existent and had to hunt them down to even get the check to leave.,1
Good Drinks in Vegas.,5
"I wasn't exactly happy with my experience here. I ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and while my steak wasn't bad, the mashed potatoes reminded me of what I used to get in high school. For the price of the meal, I wasn't expecting instant potatoes.  My boyfriend got the shrimp and pasta and there were still tails on all the shrimp.
I had asked our waiter if he could tell me if the margaritas were gluten free and he seemed to not know if the mix used, was safe and didn't seem bothered to find out. My boyfriend had a few of the drinks and they were more ice, than liquid.

I had high hopes for this place, since I read it was really good, but I was left unimpressed.",3
"I always like this restaurant but in Vegas when we went the people were confused on tables available. We would be standing waiting on a table somewhere empty and they would give it to someone else we had to almost fight for a table with their own stuff I don't know what was the problem. The food, not so great for me and I usually love the food sold at Margaritaville",3
"Service is terrible, food was terrible. I would not recommend this place.",1
"Spendy but a fun place to eat and drink. Great decor, no weak drinks. Fun place right off the main strip.",5
Wasn't as good as other Locations I visited in NJ and FL. I only heard one Buffet song the whole time I was there eating dinner. The southwest salad tasted okay but make sure you like really spicey dressing.,3
Bar staff was great.  Food was delicious. Atmosphere was fun,5
It was kind of busy but their chicken tenders and drinks were awesome!,5
"I had the steak and mash it was a really good steak, best one I've had all summer- cooked to perfection and tasty. Standard touristy restaurant though. service was good.",5
We ordered an entree & 2 margaritas & spent $48. Food & service was good. Just be prepared 2 spend $ cuz everything in Vegas is kind of pricey.,4
Do yourself a favor and do not come here while you're in Vegas. It's cliche and the food and drinks are NOT good.,2
Great experience at Margaritaville.  Our server Jodi was the highlight of the evening.  Kept us fully stocked always checking on use and very helpful. Great job Jodi!!!,5
Food was good. I ordered Fish tacos and my rice arrived cold. They brought me out a new side when I complained.  My husband's Margarita on the rocks was lukewarm and had very little ice. Requested more ice and never received any. Atmosphere was fun and enjoyable. Would definitely give this place another chance!,3
National Margarita Day had really good 6$ Margaritas,4
"Great prices on fantastic food. Portions are large, so bring your appetite! Service was wonderful and very attentive.",5
Good food,4
"Cocktail bar with the biggest size Nachos ever!! Great atmosphere & spot too. Good value for money, giving the location and portion sizes!!",5
"Nice place, great food, awesome drinks, and good service. The ambiance was cool I like the boat theme was super different.",5
"Went here once with my buddy's wife, he met us there an hour and a half later.... about when our food showed up... Lady thought my ID was fake and was being all rude about it.

My girlfriend wanted to go there a year later, despite my story. Even worse experience. We ordered food, mine came, then the waiter explained to us that if a high roller likes what he sees in the kitchen, all he has to do is ask, and it's his... which was the case with my girlfriends food.

The food is sub-par, drinks aren't that great (bad mix ratios), the service it comically slow, and some people there are rude, but some people are nice.

The Margaritaville in South Carolina is bomb, though.",1
"I fish it's was great but the rice had no salt or seasoning.
I'll definitely go back.",5
"awesome place, nice staff, the best margaritas and the nachos!!!!! ohhhh the nachos!!!!!",5
Good food and service. Prices for breakfast on the high side. But overall good deal for Vegas!,5
"The food is AMAZING!
I went here twice while i was in Vegas, Great price and excellent service, I will be going back for sure!",5
"Stacey did a great job at taking care of my party and making sure our experience was what we expected. Food wasn't spectacular, but was enjoyable. Great atmosphere!",4
Nice place. Good food and drinks,5
"VERY disappointed the Booze in the Blender girl is gone. You idiots in management took the spirit out of this place. It's like going to Casa Bonita in Denver, and they got rid of the diver. This place is nothing but a shell, now, due to more corporate greed and moron's who think they are smart and trying to make a name for themselves by cutting more corners.
We are not coming back.",2
"We loved this place.  The bar outside on the second floor above the strip is the best bar in Las Vegas for the location alone.
The Nachos are of the hook.",5
Enjoyed this place a lot. The Mermaid was awesome and got me excited. I even was approached at the bar by a beautiful blonde from Orange County. :),5
"Had the best waitress I had ever had at a Margaritaville last night, unfortunately had to many landsharks to remember her name.  She had an outstanding personality, very punctual and made our dinning experience very pleasant.  Food and drinks along with the atmosphere was outstanding.   A great place to enjoy live music and have a good time with friends.",5
Great food and amazing service.,5
"The food was perfect and the atmosphere is great...  Our waiter really put our experience down the drain... at the end he did not like the tips we left him and gave us a lecture on how we should tip in the US... I don't mind if he has a point to make if we were event wrong BUT he was seriously rude

At the end I left more than what he asked for just to show him that he is extremely  worthless",1
"Was there with a party of eight. I'm giving 2 stars because half of us had good meals. Fish and chips were good and so was the chicken quesadilla, the burgers suck and the $12.50 margarita tasted watered down and poured from a premix. Very overpriced for the quality of food. We are locals and we're here to celebrate two birthdays probably won't return the only thing it has going for it is the atmosphere.",2
Was wonderful as all ways there's never a let down at Jimmy Buffett Margaritaville,5
Great and lively atmosphere,4
Our server was not very good and it took a long time for her to bring our drinks. She never came back to take additional orders so we left after only having drinks. We will have to go back and try again the next trip to Vegas.,2
"Best Ever Bar !!! Love the bartenders! They are sociable, fun and make awesome strawberry margaritas! We just got back from our 4th time this year and their bar is a must every time we go!",5
We LOVE this place!  Great food and a wonderfully fun atmosphere...plus there's Jimmy Buffett music and videos playing!  What's not to love?  The staff is eager to please and to help us have a good time.  We  always come here when we're in Las Vegas.  We have high expectations and they're always met.   😍😀😘😎,5
"Eh.... Probably the worst place I ate while in Vegas. Decor and show were fun... Good for kids, but the food wasn't good",3
Love the island casual.,4
"Volcano nachos only had cheese and toppings on top; rest were just tortilla chips. Bloody Mary and margarita has little to no alcohol and margarita came in beer glass. Emailed manager, but they never responded. Was a yearly tradition, but will never go again due to lack of response or effort to correct error.",1
"Food was low quality, expected way better for the price.",1
Great for a decent price breakfast served only till 11 am. Their lunch n Dinner menu is also good. It's 5 o clock somewhere,4
"Excellent service from our waiter, Mike, and food was excellent. I enjoyed my Perfect Margarita. First time at a Margaritaville and we have one in my hometown.",5
"Great place. They make a great margaritas. Food is good. If you are going be in LV, don't miss this place. It is worth too see it. Service is great and waiters are very polite and friendly.",5
Very crowded. Good for them bad for me. Good food great service,3
"My daughter and I visited on January 31st, celebrating her 21st birthday. We were also celebrating her late Father's birthday, February 1st, which was the first without him.
I want to give a special shout out to our server, Gio. He not only celebrated my daughter's birthday with special enthusiasm, but when she told him about losing her Dad, he stood her up and gave her the warmest most sincere hug. He was truly exceptional from start to finish. So thank you again for everything, Gio. You made a very hard emotional night just a little bit happier.",5
Decent service and great food. The only complaint I have is the slightly overpriced food and decently long wait time. Otherwise great food and staff.,4
Great drink specials,5
"Wonderful food, strong drinks and great service! Price point is mid range, but I've never had a bad plate at Margaritaville. Shrimp and cheese grits are my favorite, but their burgers are amazing as well. They play fun music and when they have tribute band they are really good. Fun restaurant, not intimate in any way if you're thinking of a romantic type date, but a good time if you're looking to eat well, laugh and have a great time.",5
Great service and the food was good. I love the atmosphere (being a Parrot Head).  One drawback is the main bathroom is under construction so you have to go all the way up to the third floor.,5
Went here for a margarita. It was really nice. Didn't eat but the food looked pretty impressive. Staff were really friendly.,5
I’m sure they’re busy being tight on the strip but HORRIBLE service starting with the hostess and very sub-par food.  Plenty of better places to eat in Vegas.,1
Love the atmosphere & the bartenders are awesome. The food is great.,5
"Horrible experience. Staff not responsive or friendly.
160$ meal for family of 5..  meals were very overpriced.
The guy delivering our meal did not make eye contact and it seemed were an inconvenience.
Avoid this place, you will be disappointed",1
Great place,5
"This place was awesome we had the best bartenders, super funny those guys were and drinks were on point ! Definetly recommend it for the best frozen  strawberry marg. I've ever had!",5
"Had a great time here. The staff was very pleasant. The food was ok. I'd definitely go back, but perhaps for drinks only👍",5
Typical Margaritaville.  We go here every time we come to Vegas.  Only problem is they now hire local musicians and they play their stuff instead of Buffett.  I come her for the Margaritaville experience not local low quality non-Buffett music,4
"Best place for a local to feel on vacation. Great place  on the strip for food, drinks and live entertainment",5
Love there little outside patio.,5
Best margarita's,5
Accessible and friendly with good food. Parrot Heads will love the Island decor.,5
Great happy hour for $6 margaritas. We did not hear one Jimmy Buffett song the entire time we were there. Disappointing.,3
Ate there while visiting Vegas. Was quiet to compared to some of the other places we ate. Food was different but good and reasonably priced.,4
"The food was okay 👌🏾
The drink were nice and strong 💪🏾",3
Awesome!  Get the chicken nachos!,5
Hidden gem on the strip. When other breakfast places are an hour wait you can pull up at the bar and get good food. Chicken & Waffles were yummy.,4
"The food and drink are good overall, but it's a touristy restaurant; expect touristy prices.  If Jimmy Buffet music is not your thing, I'd skip coming here, as the soundtrack in the restaurant is probably about 75% Jimmy Buffet music.  The restaurant has a cool look and a fun atmosphere. We tried the conch fritters the last time we were there, and they were awful. Most of the other food we've tried has been good.",4
Burnt food chicken sandwich wait grilled chicken sandwich was burnt flavor my ladies chicken strips look like long John silver batter fish taste like it too they prey on drunk people here AVOID if possible for somewhere else where they care about you we told the service and got u want something else HA HA told her Really no we left Her tip was cook better food and I'm giving a horrible review JUNK FOOD OK DRINKS EQUAL Horrible place for a night out YUCK!,1
Jambalaya was horrible. Shrimp were cold. Way over priced,1
I made the mistake of ordering chicken fajita and they were like chicken strips seasoned as if they were fish. So my best suggestion if you come is to stick with the seafood. Other then that it's good service but a bit pricey.,3
The service was terrible ! I don’t recommend!,1
Volcano natchos.. oh my gosh amazing. Got all full before our food came out .. great service. Great food.. with coming back.,5
This place was great! Went there for Margarita Day and the had a class how to make three of their favorite Margaritas. The people teaching the class were super nice and very informative,4
Great food and atmosphere tried and enjoys 2 of their signature margaritas and they were both amazing service was great took great care of us the music was also incredible!!!!!!!,5
Great food great Margaritas great Atmosphere and perfect location on the Strip,5
"Food and drink was excellent. I came with family, 2 adults and 3 teens under 21. Our server was absolutely terrible. He started by greeting us at our table, telling us about his 'job' opening restaurants across the country (why is he here in vegas then??) and left without taking drink orders. He was gone for 10 min. He comes back to take drinks and appetizers, and then takes our menus and leaves. We have not gotten to order entrees, my father is visibly and verbally frustrated, my mother (Huge Jimmy Buffet fan, named 1st daughter Delaney after the song) is upset because her evening was ruined. It has been an hour and our server has finally come back. We're headed to in-and-out to finish the meal. Nachos were good though",2
Waitress was great. Food is so so. Could have gotten better at Applebee's for a lot cheaper.,3
Staff was very helpful and traded drinks for free.  And I love Jimmy,5
"Was definitely expecting more... A place called Margaritaville, and for $14 you get a mediocre margarita in a plastic cup?
Food was average.
Much better options on the strip.",1
"Bar tenders were awesome, great place to stop for a beverage and a bite to eat while walking up the strip.",5
"Okay, so I will start by saying this hasn't been my first experience at Margaritaville Las Vegas, but dear lord was it the best yet! Ryan, our server, wasn't just friendly and accommodating, he made it look flawless. Given that I have worked in F&B for 20+ years (and currently manage a few restaurants) Ryan's service, attention to detail, and absolute care for our experience absolutely stuck out to me. I had the Bison Burger and a BlackBerry Moonshine Margarita (BEYOND recommended on both accounts) and our table started with some jumbo pretzels. The food was timely, delicious, and a hit amongst all 8 of us. I'm grateful we had a reservation (FYI, reservations are for groups of 8 or more, and all party members must be present to be seated) and I lik forward to coming back my next trip in September. 10/10 on the food, drinks and service!",5
Food ok,3
"I should have known better than to expect anything more than this obvious tourist trap. It maybe a fun stop for a Jimmy buffet fan that wants to drink. Foodwise, it's mediocre at best and at these prices there are a lot better options close by.",2
"We love the atmosphere and food at Margaritaville.  It's great to bring young children. The have fun decor and a kids menu, TV screens playing Jimmy Buffet concerts and give kids Wix to play with.  It can be loud and the wait very long. They have call ahead seating, but not on wheels and holidays. You can bring a stroller in.  Alcohol menu is good, especially if you like beachy drinks or margaritas.  Menu is pricey, but portions are generous.",5
"Atmosphere is awesome. However, our waitress was awful....... she was rude, almost never checked on us, just terrible. Jambalaya was super bland but the spinach dip was amazing!",1
"After the Linq ride on the ferris wheel  we stopped to drink and eat at Margaritaville.   It was so much fun, we had a blast.",5
The decor was pretty cool but it was a typical chain when it came to the food. It was good and convenient.,3
Food was ok.  Service was just fine.  Visited this location about 5 years ago and had a better time then vs my recent visit.  Seems as though there are better places in the area to eat.  I would not choose margaritaville again over the numerous choices of food vendors in the area.,3
I always enjoy shopping here!  The selection of merchandise is great and the staff friendly.,5
"While I had the chicken strips and they were alright. The rest of my table said their food was terrible. With the Mac and cheese not having cheese. The ribs didn't taste good and weren't fully seasoned, and the price for these things (for their quality and taste) was not worth it in my opinion.",2
Our waitress was incredibly rude and created an overall disappointing experience. Food was decent - quite pricey for what you get though.,2
Whoa!!!  Very expensive for average food..  Not impressed with anything for the price..  Well except. The waitress was great..  If u want to pay alot of money for average food be my guest and check it out..  I on the other hand will not me back..  Roughly 98.00 for 2 average cheese burgers small basket of fries lava shrimp and 3 drinks..   Whoa!! Think I'd be better off putting my hundo on wheel. Of fortune,2
Conveniently located downstairs in my hotel.  They have a Margaritaville casino and gift shop as well.  They make a great banana frozen drink (just can't remember the name of it at the moment! ),5
Loved the atmosphere! Food portions were more than I expected. Recommend going with an empty stomach.,5
"Good food and great staff, ask for Jarred!",5
Server was awesome!  My crab cakes were very pasty.   Broccoli was not fresh and over cooked.  Margaritas were amazing.  Over all cost for my crab cakes was a bit exspensive for the quality.,3
Fun restaurant for the whole family. The nachos were great. I recommend sharing.,5
"Ordered the Cheeseburger in Paradise. It was very poor quality hamburger kind of gritty, lettuce white little pieces, cheese cold. The bun was stale. The french fries were cold, and nasty tasting. Definitely not worth $12.50 price tag. Very disappointing. Server was great! Atmosphere was fun. Next time I'll just order a beer and hummus.",4
"The food and atmosphere are outstanding! A great place to eat, especially if you're a Parrot Head!",5
"Great food, drinks and service as expected!",5
Fine sandwich and margaritas on the strip.  Had to sit at bar even though many tables were open. 😕,4
"One of our favorite places to visit when we are in Vegas! Great service, good food and amazing drinks.",5
The food is terrible. Every one had an issue with their plate due to taste. Order drinks only!,1
First time here. Sat at the bar. Courteous and FUN!,5
"Awesome staff, great food and decent prices. Loved it!",5
Cannot believe that a restaurant and bar on the Las Vegas strip would close at 1am on a Saturday/Sunday when it is getting busy. Nothing like the waiter telling you that the kitchen is closing and you have one minute to order. What happened to Vegas. You would be better off going to another place where they stay open and the staff is friendly and courteous. I believe that was my last visit to Margaritaville.,1
Must see,5
Haven't been here long enough to really tall good drinks,4
"The service was fantastic. The food, I will not eat there again. The taco salad was all meat and chips, not even a handful of lettuce, maybe 2 or 3 tiny peices of tomatoe, with a pinch of cheese, very disappointed.",3
"Would not let my family sit together because they included my one year old as the 5th person, after I traveled 2k miles to visit my mother.",1
A great place. Will return in a month or so. I had the chicken fajitas. It would have been nice if they had chicken. It came with three pieces. One was about 3 inches long by 1 inch wide. The other two were the side of a table spoon. The vegetables were great. Real good flavor. My friend had quesadillas and had a lot more chicken than I had. will be back but not for the fajitas.,4
"Savory noms. Campy like ska music. Had better fries. Started by the volcano explosion.

I went to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant before this tho.

Our server Pam was friendly. Boom. 5 stars.",5
"Fun environment, strong drink, friendly service. Food, not so much! Over priced. Not worth it",2
Food is great Margarita is  number 1 little pricey but you are in Vegas,5
The tower of mango margaritas was our pick!!! Yummy!!! Great service and fun atmosphere 😎 And I could watch the game to boot!!!,5
"I am sorry to have to do this, but review is as low as it can be. Its not the servers or the cooks, but people are probably are overworked and underpaid.
I ordered a blue cheese burger, which I had ordered about a year ago, and it was one of the best burgers ever. Unfortunately, the meat was on very average temperature (not cooked at that time), the bread was old and they didn't even make it crispy to hide it, and the fries were old.

I understand Saturday evenings people might go at other places, but its sad to see this at the center of the Las Vegas Strip.

For the bosses/owners I would recommend to spend more on your stuff to be incentivized to provide excellent food, instead of having shows, and other stuff to keep a show going while having lunch or dinner.
My two cents.",1
"Good food, good drinks, sorry for my drunk friend",5
This was a really fun place to eat. Awesome atmosphere and great service.  Nachos are bomb.,5
"Bar food.  Had the coconut shrimp with fries.  Shrimp was ok but had better fries.  Drinks expensive, but it's been a while since I have bought one.  Seafood Mac n cheese was disappointing.",3
"Margaritaville I have been going there for years. I haven't been there since or economic melt down
I was able to come visit this weekend.
And when I asked why there's no more show or why balconys were closed.
Please.. the excuse is weak.  Get a cheif with new ideas
And manager who wants to work and it be rocking like it was.",2
Nice.,5
It was okay food,3
"Great tasting food and margs.  Prices are higher, portions are generous.  Wait for two was 20 mins at prime dinner time.",5
I love love this place! Strong awesome drinks! But im so upset their chicken wings are Gone!! Was the best in Vegas in my opinion.,5
Very overpriced for mediocre food.  Not even Margaritaville could make it worthwhile.,2
The worst meal I've had in a long time. If this is a 4.2 restaurant in Vegas I think they have their workers doing the reviews. Horrible came out in a record 3 minutes. So disappointed didn't really expect much but really couldn't believe this. Service wasn't great either waiter looked like we were an inconvience for him. Never again!!,1
"Decent food and service, too pricey for what it was. Loved the Jimmy Buffett and country music/ambience.",4
"We go to Vegas every year and, after checking into our hotel, our first stop is Margaritaville.  We just love this place.  Food is great and the fun is exceptional.  My only disappointment with this place is that they stopped serving breakfast.  This was our daily routine and we really miss it.  Bring it back please.",5
"Fun atmosphere, great music and dancing. Came here with a bachelorette party and had a blast. Tasty drinks and great service. Wasn't too crowded when we went which was nice, but still lively and entertaining.",5
Great service. The food needs improvements tho. It was cold. The butter would not melt when spread on the toast nor the pancakes. Portions are quite small.,3
Great food and plenty of it for the prices!!! Friendly service. Love the pitcher margaritas!,5
Great place to sit and have a margarita or 3. Love people watching any time of day! Love it.,4
"Of course, this has all of Las Vegas written all over it. All a show, with the theme of Jimmy Buffett. Interesting decor, all seaside themed, with actual boats integrated into the decor. I had the jambalaya, which was OK. Prices were OK too. A total hilarious “show” in the middle of dinner, with a scantily dressed young lady sliding down the volcano.",5
Food was great. Margarita's were perfect,5
They just kept coming. Where are all these margaritas coming from. We had a great time there.,4
Wasn’t crazy about the food. Seemed like it could be fun if your buzzing. I guess who’s not buzzed in Vegas lol,3
Love the food and love the drinks!! Huge selection! Will be back 100 times,5
It's 5 O'CLOCK somewhere.. Does what it says on the tin. Great place to eat and drink.. But staff could be a little more friendly??!!,4
Great food and service.,5
What happened to the flipper wings that's what I came for and there gone!!?? Kala was our bartender and he was awesome! I would give you 5 stars if they would have had the wings!,4
I've always had good meals and good times when visiting. Whether sitting in the main restaurant or sitting in one of the upper levels over looking the strip. The food and entertainment make this a place to keep coming back to. Even if there is a wait the entertainment inside and outside help pass the time.,5
Food was good. Service was good. The margarita was good. Nothing to write home about.,3
Went there for lunch we shared the Volcano Nachos it was huge plenty for 2 people.I had the best cocktail Ive had in Vegas called Havanas and Bananas and it was only $11. Service was very good.,5
Love this place!! Great food and atmosphere,5
"Great atmosphere, food, and service.",5
"Good food. Good atmosphere. Insanely poor and slow service.
I am writing this at the table... still waiting for some service.",2
"Christopher was an awesome server. Sabrina was also great, we ate there several times.",5
Waited too long to be served and everything was overpriced for what it was. Instead we went around the corner to Maxie's which was so tasty and they don't skimp on the portions,1
Food was good. Service was right on. Prices a bit high for the amount of food u get. Other than that if u want a casual stop on ur trek around town pop in for lunch,4
"My husband and I had a blast at this restaurant!  The wait staff was fun and friendly,  the food was great, the bathrooms were clean, and the show was very entertaining! !",5
Love this location.  We always visit when in Vegas.  Great food and great prices for being on the strip.,5
Great food.  Excellent drinks.  Great service.  Try the coconut shrimp.,5
Very cool experience...portions were a little small.,5
The food was not that impressive in my opinion. Our waitress was not very attentive. I have to admit the beer was the best part of my meal :),2
My husband's burger was really good. My fajitas were pretty good too. Nice waitress that was very attentive.,4
Food came out so fast and hot and fresh awesome drinks,5
Excellent 🍹,5
The Jambalaya was good but the portion size was to small for the price. $21.99. Ridiculous. I been coming here for years everytime I'm in Vegas and the portion size was always reasonable and now it just seems to get smaller and smaller. I could've made it at home and fed the whole family for $21.99.,2
Good food! Great service! Good atmosphere!,5
Celebrated hubby's 75th with 25 friends and family. Very good server.,5
Talk about great food and great service!!! Amazing!!!!,5
Great food and service.  Fun atmosphere,5
Great food with an even better atmosphere! Great drink selection and plenty of excitement happening all around you. Pretty loud but you can still have a conversation at your table,5
The food was good but had to wait to long for it.,4
Atmosphere was great! Food was good. Friends always make it better!!,5
"Great service, good food prices are fair, and nice portions sizes. The sweet potato waffle fries are yummy!",5
"We come here about every other year, just for the volcano nachos. A lot of other great items on the menu and the atmosphere is hip too! Definitely recommend stopping in for a bite or of coarse a Margarita!",3
Quality and service has gone down hill quite a bit.  There are many better places to go in Las Vegas.,2
The atmosphere was really great and the food was to die for. My daughter and her new husband went there for dinner right after she got married.,5
It's kind of a must stop while in Vegas. The nachos are big enough to share between two to three people.,4
Always amazing. The Volcano Nachos are worth the trip to Vegas. The jambalaya is amazing as well.,5
Amazing music and energy. Best margarita I've ever had!!!,5
"Love Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville Restaurant. Great atmosphere, great food with good prices.",5
Stopped by for a few drinks. Sat at the bar and we had great service. The place was hopping with a fun crowd.,4
"We recently visited Las Vegas and made our regular visit to Margaritaville. We go for the experience and usually it is great. This time however was not. Apparently they are re-modeling and do not have use of there kitchen. The first thing the waitress says is “you will have to wait a long time, make sure you order what you want because we have to go up several flights of stairs to bring your food”. Wow! Anyway we expect to wait because it is always busy. We ordered sandwiches and chicken, pretty easy. Well when the food came mine was missing. It did not get made. The waitress was furious, like it was my fault. When it did arrive it was cold. I did not complain but did not eat it either. My husband and son were already finished with their meal. My son went into the restroom and someone had thrown up all over the floor. Very bad experience and not the normal fun atmosphere. Maybe you should close to re-model. Bill was $70 for sandwiches and chicken. Very disappointed.",1
"Came in with a large group of twenty two ,they knew ahead of time prior to everyone arriving. , had only one waiter who told us we couldn't do separate checks , had to do one large check or two divided checks , took our drink orders which took 20 to 30 minutes to get,  asked the hostess for chips and salsa which  never  came, then when we got our food which was good, but not worth the wait.  The check finally came at over$700 some of the drinks double charged and unaccounted for.  .Completely f****** us and the rest of our evening",1
Pretty good food with average service. The atmosphere doesn't hold up when business is slow.,3
"Great atmosphere, good food. Just a nice place to sit and relax after a long day of work.",5
"We had a group of six people and the server brought one check without asking. When we asked her if she could split the checks up, she had a REALLY BAD ATTITUDE. Didn't tell us have a great day, or anything, just gave us our change and walked away. We were a super easy table! Just don't understand why we got such an attitude.",1
Harassed by security guard was told I had to make a reservation to get in but wasn't given a website to make the reservation at from the security guard.,1
What happened to the Margaritas?! They shrunk to like 6-8 oz for $12?!,2
Great place to hang out drinks were great cheeseburger was good.  Happy birthday to our bar tender.,5
Great!!!,5
The drink was delicious and the server was great.  Best margarita in town,5
Atmosphere was great. Food was fantastic.,5
Great customer service in a very fun atmosphere.  I have always enjoyed their nachos while enjoying the music and entertaining staff.,5
Great Burgers. Very well cooked and fairly priced for location/setting. Key lime pie was fine but v overpriced for smallish piece of pie.,4
The hostess needs some customer service training. Service at table and food was very good.,4
Good food served quick with attentive courteous staff. Our consesus...nothing special...good with island decor. Kudos to Dave our waiter.,4
"The drinks are delicious here and so are the appetizers but the entrees unfortunately are not so great. We waited at least an hour for our food and our waitress was not very attentive nor friendly. If we come back, it would be for the drinks and appetizers at the bar.",3
"Save your money... It's over priced, very loud. The food was hot, but not that good. You are looking at 20 dollars a plate.",2
Just had a drink but the bartender was a very personable and funny lady,5
"Amazing appetizers. Nachos and Wings are huge. Great decor and music. Arrive early, always crowded",5
Good food good service and we love the vibe,5
helpful and friendly staff. good places for food and drinks. no good buffet.,4
Perfect margarita is the best.  Food was great and atmosphere was fantastic.,4
Good food and good service. Margheritas were good,4
Good food and atmosphere. A little pricey but everything on the strip is.,5
Always a great time! Food and drinks are excellent!,5
I absolutely LOVED it!!!!!,5
This is such an entertaining resturant. Thre staff gets the guests involved in games and you are able to try the daiquiri flavors for free.,5
180 dollars for average food. Service was horrible and no music or entertainment at all  !,1
"Just ok food. I had the cheese burger. The beef tasted good but the rest of the burger was dry with nothing on the bun. Every thing was way over priced. I have been to these restaurants before and no matter where they are located, not good food and over priced . I'm always talked into going and its always disappointing.",2
Awesome place such good food and an awesome atmosphere with very nice bartenders and waitresses!!,5
"I was in Vegas and of all it rained. I just happened into the Margaritaville,  Wow! Great fish and chips,  friendly people and a fun. Place",5
"Everyone working they're looking deeply sad, weird waiter tried to mansplain how theft worked to my table after grabbing my purse off of the back of my chair like an after school special. Incredibly strange experience",2
"Like a little piece of Key West dropped on the strip. Great drinks, music, and atmosphere! And Landshark on tap!",5
Service wasn't great. Food was decent. Prices were meh.,3
Wait staff were excellent,5
Delicious food and great atmosphere,5
Great atmosphere and good food. They got to work on their lime margaritas. Not up to standards,4
1hr 45 min wait... rude staff,2
This was right outside our hotel. We loved it. Visited 3xs love the appetizers and definitely loved the entertainment.,5
Seated quickly as possible and served just as quickly. .The food was great.,5
"Food was fine, the atmosphere was campy as expected. Pricy for a college student but its nothing unusual for Las Vegas",3
"Love Margaritaville, it is a must stop no matter where I am on vacation but this one needs a real update.  They have an amazing patio upstairs for brunch that closes at 11am but the view of the strip are phenomenal!",3
Best drinks ever and nachos! I will return for the perfect margarita!!!! I need a discount that time!....lol!,5
"Went in October celebrated my birthday in Vegas while there, I checked this place out and let me say their food is great haven't tried their drinks but from my guests they were the bomb, Sabrina was our waitress and she was very fantastic! I recommend this place when you are looking for somewhere to eat on the Las Vegas Strip.",5
Jodi is the best she handled our party of six great! Really recommend the Bottomless Mimosas!!!!!,5
"We were entertained and the staff was helpful and friendly. Everyone was having a good time.
Second time this week. It was close to the room and we thought we'd try it again.  The service and entertainment were Great...had to send back the first Caesar salads as they were wilted and served in warm bowls.  The waitress returned with fresh ones this time they were made fresh. My side salad was crisp and on a cold plate. My Portobello Sandwich was good too.  The Conch Fritters were taken off the bill by the manager as we found what appeared to be an avocado top in it.  The employees are friendly and appear to enjoy working there. The food could use better supervision.  Great place for music, margaritas, and entertainment.",4
"One of the best places on the Vegas strip. Great food, theme, and service. Nice place for some drinks but laid back from the stress of the Las Vegas fast pace. Great place to people watch as well!",5
"Great food, great service, little pricey, but worth the food when in Vegas. Even the little kids loved it.",5
The new Margaritaville is awesome! The restaurant is super nice and food is reasonably priced. We went for a Bachelorette party and they were extremely attentive and we all had fun!,5
The drink selection was outstanding and the atmosphere was great!,5
Great place to go eat great music fast service,5
I highly reccomend this place. Food is delicious,5
Nothing special. Food seems to be meant for the drinking crowd who are ordering food to absorb the alcohol. Food came out before my fountain drink. Not the strongest of service either.,2
Great drinks and food! Portions are huge..great for sharing,4
"Anywhere I go and there's a Margaritaville..I go! Very themed restaurant. Good drinks (ask for a double) food is ok. Not bad, not great. The hostess attempted to seat us back in a corner that didn't feel like it was part of the same restaurant. When I asked to sit in the main dining room she acted like it was a problem. Don't know why since the restaurant wasn't busy at all. Service was a little slow. I had fish n chips. Good choice. Huge amount of food. I think this place is more for just saying ""I went to Margaritaville""",4
We went for drinks and had a great time. Food smelled good and bathrooms were cleaner than most places in the stip.,4
Had Shrimp and Grits and it was amazing. Wait staff was fantastic and food was great.,5
Absolutely wonderful! I got the Last Mango in Paris margarita and the chicken fajitas and they were both great!!,5
Do not go here; unless you do not mind no service.  Was seated waited 10 minutes and no service.  Were told we were seated in closed section at which point we were moved to a different table.  Our party of four than waited another 20 minutes and no one came to take our drink order let alone food.  They were not that busy to even acknowledge us.  When we complained it was like I don’t care you are bothering me.  Will never go there again!,1
"The one star above is for being the first spot I’ve left no tip for a bartender probably ever. Even if the service is poor, I’ll give you credit for trying if you’re busy and you’re trying. These folks did neither. After several instances of eye contact, an empty glass and a closed menu in front of us, you’d think someone would eventually ask you if you want something else. Eventually we caught their attention long enough to ask for our bill for our single drink, left, and ate elsewhere. It wasn’t busy, nor were they even trying.  Too many places on the strip to waste time here.  This parrot head will not be back here",1
Definitely very cool atmosphere....attentive servers....good food,4
"Great burger, !!",5
Amazing food and amazing service.,5
Tourist spot..good bar food...did not play much of Jimmy's music,3
Great tasting food. Wonderful service.  Prices a little high.,4
The margaritas are really good,5
Great Nachos !! And Service,5
Interesting decor including the airplane hanging from the ceiling. The mac and cheese was delicious,5
It's ok. I have had some good experiences and some bad ones. A bit hit or miss. Decent music though.,3
Bartender was not very nice and the drinks were very weak. The atmosphere was very cool though and the food was great,3
"It's Margaritaville in Vegas, pretty self-explanatory really. The waiters are fun and the food is tasty. I highly recommend the top shelf margarita.",5
"The bar seating is quick and the ""Perfect"" margarita is truly perfect. It's 5 o'clock here most anytime. Bartenders friendly, and mix em perfectly. Enjoy the drinks, food is ok, but come for the drinks.",4
"Gluten free and safe for diagnosed Celiacs, check! A fun atmosphere that's a little different than the cliche Vegas restaurant, check! Tasty food at good prices, check! Always a must visit whenever I make it to Vegas.",5
Good food.  Great timing for great entertainment.  Waitress fair.,5
"We came here on a Thursday night (party of 6).  Servers were really nice but all of us disliked the food, food quality seemed cheap and the taste was horrible.  None of us had good things to say about the food.

All items on the menu were also very expensive, but again this location is at the middle of the strip.  I'm definitely not coming back to this place again.",2
Breakfast was great..food got served quickly and was godd,5
Great margarita lousy food.  If its not from the freezer i would be surprised.,2
I don’t know about the food because I didn’t eat here but the margarita was awesome!! 🍹,4
The lava lava shrimp we're awesome.  The margaritas were so good,5
Good and decent priced. It's nice to have a few places to go that have good food and drinks that doesn't cost an arm and a leg,5
"We always go here, when in Vegas. Love the food, but wish there was more in the way of music, throughout the week.",4
"Burger was okay. Margarita was as expected. Did not play nearly as much Jimmy Buffet as I had anticipated. There was a pirate sitting two tables over, though. That was cool.",3
"Service was fine, but the quality of the food was awful, specifically the taco salad. For almost $20, there should be more than a tiny scoop of guacamole and it was so bland! You're better off eating somewhere that uses spices and quality ingredients. Gross.",2
"I travel 3k miles for these Nachos. I know there are others closer, but don't tell my wife. I got a good thing goin here",5
"Love this place, one of my go-to spots anytime I'm in Vegas! Big margaritas and the best nachos around.  Good Cuban sandwich.  Try the Loaded Landsharks too!",5
Food was good and price was great.,5
"Food was great, exciting atmosphere.",5
Fun fun atmosphere.  Good selection of food menu and even greater margarita selection,4
Volcano nachos...thats all I have to say lol. We get them every time we're in Vegas or at any Margaritaville for the matter. They just happen to taste the best when we're in Vegas. Margaritaville is always a good time.,5
Best coconut shrimps I've ever had in my entire life!,5
"If you’re here for the nachos do yourself a favor and walk over to Nacho daddy’s!
This place is overpriced and if you want a pile of plain chips with very little toppings stay here at margaritaville but if you want delicious food and good prices where you don’t get a dry chip head on down to Nacho daddy! Trust me you won’t be disappointed!",3
"I don't usually like touristy places like this, but we caught a show close by and wanted to grab some food right after and found this restaurant. We were seated quickly, had a great server, and the food was very good.",5
"A1 bartender dude. Drinks amazing, style and efficiency on a bean(100%)",5
Great place I love the food and i go once a year when my family comes to visit,5
Frozen margarita was delish and so was the Spinach & Artichoke Dip.  Creamy-cheesy & packed with flavor.  Tortilla chips were nice and crisp with just the right amount of salt.,4
"Service was great, but food was just okay. And drinks are SUPER strong!!! Fun, lively atmosphere!",3
Hard to get to but pretty great breakfast gem,4
"My food was good but my friends was horrible and I had chicken fajitas, which didn't come with anything else and a small margarita and my bill was 40 bucks! She had the shrimp scampi... we were both disappointed with the over all experience and service! Not what we expected at all! and it wasn't busy, maybe that's why??",1
"Great atmosphere, great food. The staff was very friendly. Two thumbs up.",5
"Great food, great atmosphere, great times!",5
One of my favorite places to stop when I'm in Vegas and the kids enjoyed the entertainment also.,5
"Phenomenal food, you have to try the volcano nachos!!!  Great atmosphere!",5
"Cool Place, Margarita's went down real Well! Food was Good, met and talked with a lot of Friendly and Fun People!!!",4
Geat people.,5
"Ate breakfast here and it was fantastic. Highly recommended visiting. I know we were close to the lunch rush which made service less than stellar, and poor for Vegas, but the food and drinks made up for it.",5
Go! The food is awesome and the atmosphere is so fun! Book ahead though the wait can be long,5
"Friendly staff, great food, and very reasonably priced",5
One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. Great food and service.,5
"I don't like the ribs, toooo much BBQ sauce, to much! And the cuban sandwich need attention",3
"Brown short hair female bartender was very rude. Had a group of 4 and the bar seats were full. We were told the sections surrounding the bar were closed. Really would have liked to sit down and have a drink, but she said we couldn't sit at any of the tables surrounding the bar. Went to the upstairs bar and the male bartenders were less than friendly. Not impressed",2
Fun but spendy,4
Best drinks,5
"Compared to some of the other restaurants on the Strip, I felt I got value for money at this place. We paid $30-40 for a main and a drink. I liked the burger!",4
"Good food, great atmosphere. First bar server was not very friendly our dinner waiter was great.",4
Great food and great atmosphere fun place to go,5
"If you can get served I'm sure it'd be cool. Bartenders just throw around drinks but don't serve you, they're complete tools. 5 cent drinks, my ass. If you're from Minnesota and have yellow papers, just use a fake.",1
"Had a great time, but kind of pricey.",4
It's ok.. very accommodating to large groups,4
"Pretty mediocre, it was fine for a quick stop for dinner but there are so many places to eat in Vegas, and this was just okay.",3
Delicious burgers and ribs!,5
"This place is an absolute DUMP. I have been to other locations and they were OK, but this place is a complete filthy mess. Unless you are a college kid on spring break avoid this location and go to Cabo Wabo or Senior Frogs instead. Both are in better condition. You can tell Margaritaville has gone totally corporate. Jimmy would never let it look like this.",1
LOVE this place. Great food great music good service,5
"This place was a complete disappointment. My neighbor is a huge fan of this chain so I had high expectations. 10 of us went for dinner, no one had a good meal. My coconut shrimp had waaaay too much breading. No one finished their meal. Maybe it was a bad night in the kitchen but I wouldn't make an effort to go here.",1
"Used to be a spot I would have to always hit in Vegas because of the nachos. Latest visit the place was dead, the food was cold, our server didn’t check on us (but did the table right beside us) and when we told him the food was cold (after having to ask a bus boy to send him over) he scolded us for continuing to eat it. Sorry, we were starving!
I’m not a fan of being scolded by servers, so I most definitely will not be returning. Total shame!",2
"Pretty good food, great margaritas. Didn't know about the ""show"" (woman in bikini comes out of the volcano and slides down into giant margarita glass before dancing around the bar area), found that tacky and could've done without it.",4
Great restaurant.  Good food. Great music,5
"Tasty food & decent portions. Kind of pricey.
But it's Vegas, so also kind of expected.",4
"Just stopped by for drinks with the family. Very pricy, but the ambiance was great",4
Convenient for an average meal located across from the Ceasar resort,3
Great as usual I love their bar-b que wings .,5
"Food is good, service is outstanding, and portions are huge. Yes is pricey but this is Vegas, you should already know that going in.",5
Good food at a decent price. Great service. Good atmosphere.,4
"Food was GREAT server wasn't pleasant.. not sure if he was having a bad day, hates his job, or doesn't like black people. We were sitting for 10 minutes before some one came over to the table and when he did he said I'll be back.. no name introduction, what do you guys want to drink to start you off or anything. Comes back after another wait with water assuming that's what we wanted to drink and introduces his self. Leaves yet AGAIN. Comes back and asks what we want to order. He checked on us ONCE, he walks by so I asked if we could get our checks. He pulls our bills out from his pocket and we happened to look at the time that said 12:54. 30-40 minutes before we got done at the restaurant. Didn't ask if we wanted anything else to drink or anything like that.. as we are getting ready to leave a group of WHITE people sit in his section and he's over there in 2 minutes, smiling, introducing him self, etc. sucky service from KELLY. No tip from me sir. Corporate will hear from me",2
"What a fun place to visit, great humorous bar staff!",5
First time in Vegas they showed me and my friends a good time we had a blast it was amazing thank you,4
The shrimp & grits were the best I have tasted,5
"Service was exceptional. The food was ok. But, it was so dark in there in the middle of the day it was hard to read the menu. Been there several times before and will go back after remodeling is done.",3
"We've had breakfast there twice and it is amazing, such great food I would definitely recommend it.",5
"Once again, the food was sweet tasting. The bartender was very nice and helpful though..",3
"Online reservations don't work, but everything else was great, as usual. Love the atmosphere, the food, and, of course, the margaritas!",5
"Good food and drinks, great atmosphere",5
Such a great time my honey and I had! Can not wait to go back.,5
Service was a little slow but the food was great for the price and the atmosphere was outstanding.,4
I was very disappointed when I ordered a margarita and got a regular soda glass and it didn't even taste good.  Margaritaville failed horribly.,1
I was there for a dinner. Nice place to visit with friends. I ate bufflo sandwich with fries. It cosyts about $18 and it was  delicious. I tasted bufflo meat for the first time and I like it. Nice bartenders I'm n this place.worth to go.,5
"Great environment, great location and great food and drinks 👍",5
"Loved it, pricey, you pay for the ambience!",4
The drinks are great. Ask for a recommendation. Very competent bartenders.. thx paddy.,5
Delicious food and great energy. We danced and had a great time.,5
"Everything about this place makes it a great choice: food, service, entertainment. You really should give it a try.",4
Great margaritas. Good view from upper deck. A+,5
"The BEST place to eat on the strip! Fun atmosphere, music, & the food is AMAZING ❤",5
Havana Banana was a dessert in a cup.. so delicious,5
Great Margaritas. Nice atmosphere and good food.,5
"Food is so tasty, margaritas as well! Love this place!",5
The restaurant was clean and our server was very polite and efficient. Food was tasty and margaritas were great.,5
Super Jimmy Buffet expérience. Nice decor. Caribbean themed.,4
"Delicious food and drinks! Great music and atmosphere. No fights, no jerks, I was surprised the diversity of the crowd and with alcohol, there were no fights. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.",4
Always a great meal when in Los Vegas. Great Margarita good food fair prices.,5
Subpar food for a high price.,2
"I always stop there when Im on the strip!
Staff food and of course drinks are great!!",5
Ther food here was surprisingly good and the beer special was a lot of fun!,4
if you wand decent food this is definitely not the place to go! My burger cost $18 and a McDonald’s dollar menu burger was better.,1
"Got a seat at the bar right away, food was great, waitress was super accommodating. A great time was had.",5
Soooo good. We had a delicious meal. The sushi nachos were an unexpected favorite. Yummmmmmm,5
Excellent time and the food was delicious 😋,5
Restaurant was half empty but we were told to wait in line to be seated. After 15 min of waiting we decoded to find a different place and left,1
comfortable enviroment and great food,5
i got no words to describe ur good environment its was hella cool.......u got the best service ever and for Tatiana thanks 🙏 tatiana ur ur exelente travajo y buen servisio  me agrado 10000000000000000 likes,5
"Good food and cool rooftop bar. Starts playing loud, non-jimmy buffet-esque music at nite",4
Great food. Was a little slow getting the food. It is fun waiting though.,5
"Excellent service and food. I had the Cheeseburger in Paradise, of course.",5
"They still make us the drink we come for, even though it is no longer on the menu. Love it!",4
I had a blast ok a blast we danced on stage and all,5
Oh my goodness... What a wonderful clean place..,5
"Always stop here on our vegas trips!! Great service, Valcano nachos are BOMB!! Loaded landshark on tap is a MUST!!",5
"Went here for breakfast and a Bloody Mary.  To say the service was bad is an understatement.  I sat at the bar for at least 10 minutes while the bartender serviced the opposite side of the bar. He occasionally serviced my side, serving people who came in AFTER me but never made eye-contact with me.  I was literally sitting next to the cash register! I didn't call him out because I was so amazed that he ignored me.  I did get approached by a homeless person asking for spare change.  Go figure. At any rate, once I did get serviced I was so displeased that I just ordered a Bloody Mary and went about my way.  Never again. This place would get zero stars if possible.",1
great food. great drinks. excellent location,5
Very nice atmosphere and good service,4
I enjoyed their breakfast every morning.  The staff was very friendly as well.,5
Really good restaurants,5
Nothing like a cheeseburger in Paradise while at Margaritaville.it was pretty quiet and laid-back must have been there during an off time.,4
"Good food,  good atmosphere, a little pricey compared to others nearby.",4
Drinks great but prices are high.,4
Bartender poured great drinks and wait staff was very nice and timely. Good food too and reasonable prices for Vegas,5
"Great food, we took most of ours with us.we would of loved to get a tshirt  but a little more then we could spend.",5
"Unique style restaurant,  food was good but fairly pricey, had the jambalaya and it was very good.",4
"Good food, yummy drinks super fun atmosphere  . You should go !",4
"Good bar food, server was attentive.  Foid came out hot and and in a timely manner.  Nachos are huge, great for a big group two will have a tough time finishing.  Giant pretzel is huge also, took that home in doggy bag, lol.
Tsunami drink was full of rum, whew it was one stiff drink.  Had our picture take, nice touch for a tourist from margaritaville!!",5
Not as good as I had hoped. Disappointed with gift shop. Food was okay. (I appreciate the fact that management promptly responded to this review. - added one star). Still wish they had a JB/Marg. LasVegas hat... To Mgmt: thanks for listening.,4
Food is mediocre but.the perfect margarita is exquisite and they do a great job keeping the water glasses filled!,3
Had the jambalaya. Meh. Should've got the cheeseburger in paradise. Good vibe though and excellent service.,4
Best margaritas you can ever find. It used to have really nice outdoor seating but that's gone now hence 4 stars instead of 5,4
Absolutely love this place! Friendly staff and great food and drink xx,5
"Bad bartender, can't make a good margarita. I hate it when a bartender can't get a drink right. First one was way to strong and too much orange liquor. I passed the 'perfect margarita' to my partner and asked for the 'house margarita' which she said will be more of the classic margarita taste. All juice and couldn't taste any liquor. Drinks are not hard to make if you are a real bartender.",3
The food is mediocre and especially for what they charge. I could get a better burger at applebees. You are basically paying for the atmosphere. I didn't even eat it all.,1
The server(i had) has ZERO customer service skills and ZERO desire to acquire said skill. She is a bad apple to an otherwise good bunch. I enjoy the experience...but her service is really bad for that business. I hope management takes note...,1
Great Cheeseburger in Paradise and sweet potato fries.,4
Two words: Watermelon Margarita!,5
Decent food. Great atmosphere !,5
"Food was ok, server was a little flustered as we were a large party during a busy time and unfortunately our checks were all mixed up. I would go again to give it a second chance.",3
"Excellent food, drinks, and staff.",5
"Very disappointing, having had a long held desire to visit Margaritaville on several trips to Florida and never managing it, I was super excited to spot one next to our hotel on a recent visit to Vegas. Decor was quirky, and the girl on the door was friendly, this is where my good experience stopped. Unfortunately I have a small appetite and dared to ask for the kids menu... this was grudgingly brought, I chose my main and then enquired about the drink that was meant to come with it, to be told in no uncertain terms that I couldn't have it as I was not a kid.... fair enough but I'm sure there would've been a polite way of phrasing it, I felt totally humiliated, but not as bad as I felt when I went to order the fries that I'd forgotten to ask for, to find my server laughing about and bad mouthing me to her colleagues, if I hadn't been with the rest of my family, who were all hungry, I would've left. The food I have to say was underwhelming, barely warm and seriously over priced, I had ribs & chips, (and that's literally all I got, I mean come on guys, even Dennis and it hop make your meal look nice with a bit of salad garnish.... my meal looked like it had been dumped unceremoniously  on a plate that was too big for the portion size), I quite frankly wish I hadn't bothered. I did make contact with customer services at Margaritaville head office but never had a reply, so I assume they're not bothered about good customer relations   My advice, try somewhere else if you want an experience that's memorable for good reasons rather than bad",1
Not bad. Good was decent and service was good.,4
Loved the food the atmosphere Mike was awesome and so were the bahama mama's,5
Excellent food.  Loved the fish tacos.  Fun atmosphere.,5
We enjoyed the experience and we recommend you take you family.,4
Did have that Margaritaville feel like it used to.  They cheapened up the red bull Margarita.,1
Good burgers. Great staff. Kids had virgen daquiris they really enjoyed!,4
Had more fun at this place than any club I went to. Definitely a cool place for people in their 20s and 30s.,5
They have the BEST drinks..food is good big portions however the drinks!!! Love em,5
The food here is pretty average. Nothing special about it. What's cool about this place is the free mini show they put on but that's pretty much it.,3
Casual place with music.  Lots to choose from the menu.  The was 6 of us and I didn't hear any complaints.,5
"I went here with my family & when the food was brought out they had brought me the wrong sandwich... my whole family ate and were done when my correct order was finally brought out, about 30 min later. Then the manager was not extremely accommodating. I was looking forward to eating here but this almost caused us to miss our show and made the experience awful.",1
Ribs were terrible. “Bbq sauce was salty af” not worth the $30.,1
They have a big sign with picture of eggs bacon and toast and I was craving every time we passed so the big day and yes it was as good as the picture my husband had the crab omelets and he enjoyed every bite very clean good service,5
Great place for food in the strip. Great for a large group of 40 and reasonable...,5
Great food and service.,5
ALWAYS HAVE TO STOP HERE WHEN IN VEGAS!,4
Perfect cocktails and the biggest club sandwich I've ever had in my life,5
We like eating eating breakfast there. The food is good but a little pricey.,4
Great drinks and food.  Great time.,5
Good food and drinks.,4
It was fine. Seemed a little overpriced for what it was. Good drinks but mediocre food,3
We had a large group and the staff was very accommodating. Food came out quickly and everyone enjoyed their meals.,5
Rooftop bar is fun early evening place to watch the lights come on.,4
"A typical chain restaurant.  Uninspiring food, but prices are reasonable.",3
It's not my scene but it's a nice bar with a really good live band,3
Horrible food and very unprofessional service! The ribs were cold and tasted horrible! The manager wouldn't even take it off of the ticket. Very disappointing!,1
Best meal in vegas. Great service. Fun and energetic,5
Jared H. did a great job as our server. He was funny and kept us laughing. He also gave great advice on where we could go that night. Thanks Jared!,5
Not just for cocktails. They have an excellent assortment of breakfast options.,5
"PRICING FOR FOOD IS CRAZY!!! ITS OUTRAGEOUS FOR A NORMAL CHEESEBURGER!! I CAN EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE, GET FULL, AND CHEESEBURGER WILL BE CHEAPER THAN THIS PLACE. PEOPLE....YOU'RE CRAZY IF YOU PAY THESE PRICES FOR A CHEESEBURGER. THE MARGARITAVILLE I ATE AT WAS IN MYRTLE BEACH, SC......... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY & TIME!!! THANKS!",3
"Was in Vegas two years ago and ate here every night.  Expecting the same great food, prices and service we went there again.  Terrible service, the hostess and help were very unprofessional,  could care less about the customers. The prices were high for the quality of food.  Not going back.",1
"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere! A great location!",5
Excellent nachos and delicious cocktails. Very cool vibe here,5
"Service is poor, pancakes were burnt, and I mean black. Sent them back. A tiny dab of cold hashbrowns and eggs. Long wait for food both times. 0 stars, so disappointed.",1
Awesome my favorite place to go while in vegas.  Love it,5
Great margaritas.  I went with a group of Co-workers to Margaritaville Restaurant and had a fun time.,5
Good food good booze yummy all the way around,5
Great chicken teriyaki bowl. Fun place.,4
Great food friendly staff. Tables where a little dirty.,4
Awesome drinks and the food was good. Be prepared to pay a little more but the experience of bing there along w the entertainment is awesome!!,5
"What a fun place to go, had alot of fun",5
"The chips suck! Best nachos I've had if the chips didn't taste like they came from the gutter, tostitos would be better, service was great experience was nice but sisco food is not worth the price they charge",3
Very boring poor service!!,2
Great happy hour drinks and food,5
great margeritas food was not all that..but had a blast!!!,3
"Margherita was decent, as to be expected, also enjoyed a fish sandwich. Do not get the quesadilla, it only had cheese in it. Maybe it was an error, or their standard quesadilla is made for the average 5 year old. No real options as far as burritos and tacos, which was a disappointment considering their name.",1
This was one of the worst restaurants I've been to in years. We had a party of 9 people with a variety of food selections. Several meals were sent back because they were poorly cooked. The ribs were tough. The regular margaritas on the rocks were not good. The strawberry margarita was the worst I've ever had. I don't usually write bad reviews.  I wish we had gone somewhere else.,1
"Nice atmosphere, good food great staff",5
Great food and no long wait to be seated and service was awesome,5
Nothing special about it. Want some better food go else where Mac and cheese will cost you 25 bucks,1
"Didn't have margarita flights, food was okay...but expensive. Our server was great.",3
The best damn margarita in town.,5
Good times and good drinks. Good place to grab a bite and a few drinks.,3
Overpriced,2
"Good food, nice ambience but pretty loud considering they were not busy.",4
We ate at this place the day before we left Vegas I highly recommend you order the shrimp and grits it was awesome very good prepared nicely loved it,5
"Love this place, great atmosphere, with a strip(street view)",5
Went for breakfast and it was ok. One of the main items was out and the food was pricey for the amount of food you get. Good service saved the experience.,4
My wife wanted to stop in and try this out. The burgers are good. We also tried the cinnamon sugar sweet potato bites. It was a a bit weird finding parking so we could get here but ended up walking about a 1/4 mile. Over all it is nice and the food is good. Our waitress was nice and the staff was friendly.,5
"Great Burger joint! After a fun and ""hydrating"" day on the strip this resturant had exactly what we needed to keep our Vegas fun going. The food came out hot and fast, they even gave us complimentary drinks on the house!  The staff was attentive and the bar tender was wonderful. I noticed a few people complained about pricing,  however this is right on the Las Vegas Strip and compared to other places the prices seemed fair.  5 star food and service.  Will return again when back in Vegas.  Our bar tender that evening was Justin R. He was helpful in answering any questions we had and helping with picking out our delicious meal.",5
"Our first visit to Wahlburger’s was great!!!
The restaurant is located in front of the Bally’s casino ( at the Grand Bazaar shops) . It is very nice and clean restaurant, very welcoming and inviting atmosphere, they have an outside seating area too and a full bar as well.
We have ordered for the starters: Truffle Fries, Buffalo Chicken Wahlbites , Spinach and Parmesan Wahlbites . We have been pleasantly surprised with the Wahlbites, they are so yummy, fresh baked , just delicious! They go very well with their house sauce - a must try!
We have also had their: The impossible Burger 🍔, The super melt and O.F.D.  burger 🍔 and Jenn’s chicken salad.
Burgers are very tasty and good quality and they were cooked exactly how we ordered them ( which rarely happens, because we like them well done and we always have to send them back, but not this time ). The food was perfectly seasoned, very flavorful and presentable.
They have THE BEST onion rings ever, highly recommended!!!
We also had their adult shakes: Mud pie and Funky Monkey. ( it definitely has a kick of alcohol in them , but they are so good)
Omg , so delicious 😋, yummy 😋, MUST TRY!!!
Great variety of menu items and reasonable prices for The Strip location.
The staff is super friendly and helpful, we felt welcomed and appreciated!
Highly recommend this restaurant and definitely worth the visit!!!",5
Great place and service. Food was good and EDMusic like you were at rave lol Atmosphere was good,4
"I am a frequent visitor. Staff is friendly so if you travel alone sit at the bar, order food, a fruity drink and chat with bar tenders. Food is super tasty and vegetarian friendly as they have beyond burger and portabello burger. As a foodie I highly recommend this place.",5
"Had a single burger and had to try the Chipotle chicken strips and wash it down with one of the biggest and best Strong island tea's. The bartenders were great, nice guys joking and having a great time and staying on top of everything.
The burger was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Very tender and juicy,  not greasy.
The chicken strips come with ranch... what a waste. They don't need any dipping sauce for them.  If anything, bring me more of the sauce they're tossed in.
Told my buddy he had to finish his drink or he wasn't allowed to keep his cup. It's only a souvenir cup if you finish your drink. Even if you have to take it with you.
Great experience, excellent food and drinks and fast, friendly service.
Thanks for a great meal that didn't leave me crying at the bill and amount of food.",5
The staff were great. The food was delicious. A little pricey but it's vegas. The drinks were great as well and you get to keep the cups the only thing missing was Donny.,4
I had The Fiesta burger and house made chili and I couldn’t even eat it all because of all the meat between my 2 items. They were so delicious. Mad I couldn’t finish my chili because I was full. My husband had The Our Burger which he said was great tasting. Our waitress Trina was awesome she kept checking on us. And before we left she took time to take a picture of us by  the Wahlberg’s photo. Thank you for  great food and service,5
"Great location right on the strip but it sits back a little.  Its a great area and the food is fantastic as always.  This right here is Paul's burger, I love it, and the pickles are soooo good...the sauce too!  I use to be just cheese, lettuce, and onion type a person until I tried Wahlburgers for the first time and ate it how it is made and I was not disappointed.   Its a must eat in any city if you see a Wahlburgers- GO!",5
"Love the service, great people....but dropped $60+ on 2 burgers and a cup of chili, and neither my wife or I ate our burgers.  Both were ordered well done and were pretty rare once we bit into them.  Definitely had higher expectations.",2
"One of my favorite places to eat at the strip! Open till' late at night every night unlike a lot of places, and the burgers are amazing! Servers are very nice and attentive, and the place is very clean.",5
"An outfit created by the Wahl brothers (Mark Wahlberg, Donnie..).

I didn't know what to expect coming into this place. I mean it's just another place kind of hidden away off the Las Vegas strip.

The place is relaxed with friendly people. Kind of like the personality of Mark Wahlberg - relaxed and cool 😎

I ate at the bar. Had the Fiesta burger. Ran me $15.66 along with the tax.
Was the burger amazing? It was very very good. It's Vegas so the price doesn't surprise me.

It's just a very nice and comfortable place to come with friends and hang out. Like it says on the wall here: there is no better feeling than sitting at the table together, sharing good food a few laughs and lots of love. 😄",5
"Hostess was a bit rude but the waiter was very nice. Not the ""coziest"" resturant in the world and the music is a bit loud but i guess it works for a quick burger. The BBQ burger was quite bland, the our burger was good but nothing special, soda is defenitly over priced.",3
Didn't have anything that wasn't amazing here. I would highly recommend it. The,5
The burgers were absolutely delicious. Didn’t care for the onion rings. The chili was awesome. Service was great as well. Definitely will return.,4
"First time eating at a Wahlbergers! Had a bacon cheeseburger, wish I could have eaten two, it was excellent! Service was great, I would highly recommend grabbing a bite to eat here. On top of everything else, the meal didn't break the bank either, can't wait to eat it again when I'm back in Vegas.",5
Really enjoyed eating here! Had a gluten free bun and the server was experienced in suggesting other options to avoid gluten as well. The burger itself was cooked well and tasted great! Will def eat here again before our trip is over.,5
"Food delicious.  Service excellent and all employees very friendly.  ""Adult milkshakes"" incredible.  It would be nice if they turned down the music so you converse with your friends.",5
"Most chain or celebrity owned restaurants never do it for me, but there are some you just have to try. Well this one was worth every penny. Our 1st stop after checking in to the hotel was here. I had the Super Melt and my wife had the Our Burger. They were made just how I do at home (Perfect).... it was so good, we came back for breakfast a few days later. I couldn't resist the Sloppy Joe. It was a hit and a definitely a place I will visit again, wherever I might find one.",5
"This is one of my favorite places to eat when I’m in Las Vegas! I have been to other locations but I’ve always enjoyed this one in particular. The food is always great! I always try to get a different burger when I go. The Our Burger, the Impossible Burger and the Thanksgiving Burger are a few of the delicious choices to choose from. I always look forward to trying new items on the menu when I’m here. The staff has always been very friendly each time I’ve been there. There are many restaurants to choose from here but definitely give Wahlburgers a try, they have something for everyone and you won’t leave disappointed!",5
"We sat at the bar and loved our server, I ordered the burger with fresh jalapeños and salsa. The burger was smaller than we expected, but had a lot of flavor. Wasn't impressed with the soggy bun and small cup of fries that we had to pay for as a side. Husband ordered the Mac and cheese, which tasted good, but watery. Overall, eating anywhere in Vegas you expect to spend a lot of money, but also expected the quality to be better as well.",3
The burger was great and the tater tots were Amazing.The staff was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back before returning home.,4
"5 stars for their Cobb salad and it will fill you up. Skip the burgers you need at least two orders to fill you up. Their burgers are smaller version of shake shack, good buns but meh burger patties. $14 for a small burger is way overpriced. 1 star for the burgers. Skip the burger. It doesn’t come with fries. Truffle fries is skimpy on truffle oil so you barely taste it. Skip the fries.  Root beer float is good. Alcoholic shakes are also good.",3
"This place is great. Literally had no idea it was the Wahlberg family burger chain and made a joke about it being such, only to find out it legitimately is.

Everything we've ever had here is awesome. The burgers and sandwiches are great. Onion rings are more of onion strings. I think they're actually made with shallots, honestly. Which is fine. Just don't order them if you are expecting big, thick cut steakhouse onion rings. Honestly, though, my favorite thing here is the macaroni salad, which their website shows isn't at some of their other locations. BRING THE MAC SALAD TO ALL LOCATIONS, PLEASE! I'm not sure what it is. The little bits of sweet pimento or whatever they use maybe? But it's great.

I'm not a bloody Mary drinker, but my wife says theirs is awesome. They offered me a taste of their premixed hurricane, though. Don't order it unless you wanna get absolutely hammered. The thing smells and tastes like you could light it on fire.",5
"Yandel, my server was super nice!! One of my daughters (Bev) is deaf, autistic, and super picky!! Our food was Fan ""F'in"" Tastic.. Seriously
I ordered the Fiesta Burger (made me sweat in a good way kind of spicy)
Bev ordered Our Burger, but insists everything be on the side.. thank you Yandel.. Bev was super happy with her food.😁
And my youngest ordered the ""Mom's Favorite Mac N Cheese..
The fries have extra flavor.
Between the 3 of us we spent $70.",5
That's one Tasty burger! the tater tots are amazing too! Our waiter was super cool I wish I could remember his name 👍,5
"After a long day,while roaming on LV strip we saw Giordano's and Wahl burger. Sincewe already had Giordano's in chicago we decided to give Wahl burger a try (with no idea who owns it). Since there was no rush we were seated immediatly. First thing I saw was Mark Wahlberg's pic and then my wife read some wrtitings and posters and said to me that it is owned by wahl brothers (Including Mark). Our server was pretty good and we ordered double decker beef burger with french fries. The burger was juicy and cooked to perfection and fries were pretty good too. At that point we decided to give it a go again. On our next visit we ordered same burger but the taste was not same we don't know what happened. That second visit is the only reason for 4 stars on this review. 😊",4
The ONLY reason I give it 2 stars was because of the lemonade and souvenir cup.. the DRIEST burger ever.. they don't give you lettuce or tomatoes unless requested.. the truffle fries were basically french fries with parsley sprinkled on it.. no taste at all.. The picture lady waited until we got our food to interrupt us.. making it lukewarm to cold... PLUS we were welcomed by a woman vomiting behind us!!! Go to Burger King and save $40 bucks!,2
"I really, really wanted to like it as I'm a huge fan of the Wahlberg family.
I did a take out order and it took a long time for an associate to take my order because they were busy chatting and laughing about something.
After I placed my order, the burger was ready in less than 30 seconds, which is even faster than McD!
The patty had a very nice flavor to it but it was slightly overcooked and there was nothing special about the rest of it. Average bun and pickles etc.
I'm happy I got to try it, and I wish the Wahlberg family the very best success but I wish there was more to this burger.

And they forgot my fries 😪 Got back to my hotel and was so disappointed.

Please click the 👍🏾if you liked this review and follow me for more reviews! Thank you.",3
Everything we tried was delicious! The atmosphere was awesome! Only complaint...Mark was not there! Lol. Maybe next time!,5
"After wandering the strip for a couple hours and trying to decide ""Do I go cheap like McDonald's or go for real food?"" I decided to check out Wahlburgers, seeing how Mark and I share a name we may share the same values....
WOW! So disappointed in the burger... $13.45US for a McDonald's burger with real bacon... I honestly don't know what to say...",1
"Mac n cheese gets my approval! Creamy cheese with bacon and bread crumbles was a perfect combination. Chicken bites were really tasty to. Service was good, food was served timely, overall experience was great!",5
They make a really simple tasty burger here and their fries are really good too. We used to like to get the collectible green plastic drinking cups but they no longer give you those. It took our waitress three reminders to bring our waters.,4
"Burger was really good, but drinks were overpriced in my opinion and not the best.",4
"Service was great, our waitress Brittany was prompt, accurate, and very kind. Burgers were great, shake was great, tots were great, sweet potato tots were too soft/soggy. Our only complaint is mister “let me take your picture, no obligation to buy”. Not fun being lightly harassed into buying mediocre pictures. No hate but it’s 2021, everyone has a phone and can take their own pictures, add frames or whatever for free. Sorry but that was annoying.",4
"Stopped in for a break from the heat and a quick snack. Also, it's a mandatory stop for this Blockhead!  The Mezwahl was delicious,  if you like mezcal, chili pepper, and tamarind:awesome! Our server, Daniel, was friendly and attentive.",5
"Greeted with an ice water (crushed ice, my favorite).

We sat at the bar for quick seating since it was full inside. To give some context, there was record breaking heat in Vegas that weekend. The patio seating has misters that work great.. But this frizzy haired girl was trying to avoid looking like I got struck by lightning.

Great ambiance. Fun color scheme, cold AC, and some thumpin tunes.

Beer is served frothy COLD. Somehow a Blue Moon just tastes better at Wahlburgers.

Holy moly, best burger I've ever had. Highly recommend the BBQ Bacon burger. Secret sauce, avocado, bacon... perfect trifecta. They're not the biggest burgers I've seen but man, do they pack a punch with flavor. Had the sweet potato tots on the side (was so full but couldn't stop eating them, they're delicious). All in I spent $60 between mine and my partner's food and beers. Not terrible for Vegas, and the flavors were worth every penny.

Will definitely come back!",5
"We decided to try Walhburgers today located at 3649 Las Vegas Blvd. S Unit 600,  Vegas Strip. The crowd was pretty thick and the menu had a large variety of items for you choose from. The wait too be seated wasn't long at all but once we were seated it took a few minutes for someone to wait on us. Finally a nice gentleman named Dakota came over and took out order. Very nice gentleman. We looked over the menu and decided to get the Fiesta burger. The burger was suppose to be a 1/2 pound burger but ours was pretty small. We decided to share a meal but it turned out well. With that being said the burger was small but very tasty. We also got a Ceasar salad that was absolutely delicious. The Ceasar dressing tasted a little a little bland but other than that everything was pretty good. If I we're to visit Vegas again I would possibly visit Wahlburgers again. My only wish was is that would gotten to see Mark or Donnie. Lol. If you're in Vegas give Wahlburgers a try",4
"Top 3 restaurants ever. From Houston, Texas, and have been to many 5 star restaurants that weren't half as good as this place. It was pretty cheaply priced for being right off the Vegas Strip, but incredible food. Hit Houston up next, please!",5
"We visited on a Monday afternoon with luggage in tow. The service was spot on, the wait staff was very attentive and checked in often. I had The Original medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. The burger could have used more seasoning for flavor but other than that it’s delicious. The price is standard for Vegas. My friend has the spicy 🥵 bacon tots. He liked it. They weren’t very spicy to me. Now to the winner (pictured) the blood orange margarita on the rocks. It’s slightly sweet and tart but great. It’s a winner.",4
"First off I would like to say we love all of the Wahlbergs!!  We have eaten at the Los Angeles Wahlburgers, and it was amazing. On the other hand, the Las Vegas restaurant was sub par. It was not particularly clean (but it is right on the strip, so maybe that’s why?) The service was great though! He was very attentive and cheery! Now the food…one of my favorite things about Wahlburgers is their buns. Unfortunately this restaurant does NOT have them.  They’re not pillowy soft and fluffy, just basic store bought buns. Also, the Wahl sauce should be made standard so it tastes the same at each location. This sauce was very dark orange and extremely sweet. I was upset because it is one of my favorites. The drinks were delicious! (Although I didn’t see Jenny’s lemonade…but I settled for something else). Also, their AC was on the fritz, so being in Vegas, it was uncomfortably hot while we were eating. Other than those few issues, the food was…good. We also ordered the Mac and cheese which of course is the best!  I can only hope this location/franchise owner steps up with their standards and represents the Wahlberg values like they should be.",3
First if I have to say the food was delicious. I do not review much but I thought Alfonso deserves some recognition. The service was the best part. During my stay in Vegas he was the only server out of all the restaurants I visited to suggest water with my adult beverage and kept it full. It’s the little things that go unrecognized that I appreciate.,5
We visited few years ago and liked it and wanted to try again but the food quality is not good as what it was few years ago .. Their chicken sandwich is hard to chew ..,3
"Enjoyed a nice cold Bud Light and a fantastic burger. I’d never been to a Wahlburgers and really didn’t know what to expect. But they made it to my request of medium and hit it on the nose. Very juicy burger and I loved the fixings on the Our Burger. I would have given a 5 star but the fries were awful, just had a strange taste to them and too unseasoned. And the bartender (I sat at the bar) really didn’t care that I was present. But I’d go back for the burger, for sure!",4
"First time at a Wahlburgers, usually have a rule that I don't do any chains on vacations but I thought I could make an exception for this one as it's a place that I've never been and has a big name. There's a few in Ohio, but, I've not made it to any so decided on here for an early morning lunch.

Nice atmosphere, decent menu to choose from, service was nice. Our waitress was friendly and efficient.

We got two of the ""our"" burgers, the difference being mine was the double decker.  The burgers were good, but wildly greasy, to the point in which I had to use multiple napkin to sit on the bottom of the tray to soak it up, and, the bottom bun was incredibly soggy. Fries, were good, but wasn't any different then any other fry. Food was very mediocre, not horrendous by no means, but on the lower end of mediocre. There simply was no 'WOW' factor, for the most part, it wasn't much different then a five guys or fast food joint.

One of the ladies going around taking photos of customer's, telling them to pose for 'free photos', then coming back seconds later, and spreading them out on the table (as I'm trying to eat) in an attempt to get us to buy them, at fairly high prices. We say, no, then she proceeds to take frames off and offer another price. We, said no thanks? I came into a restaurant to get out of the heat, have a meal, and escape all of the Vegas scams and money grabbers, NOT to be bothered during my dinner by one...

All in all, very mediocre experience, if not more close to fast food then a decent restaurant, in which we also were pressured to buy something we never asked for, nor wanted in the first place.
It's not horrendous, but not spectacular, and I would say when in Vegas on the strip, there's literally hundreds of options that would likely serve better food and a better experience.

I would recommend Wahlburgers in more low key areas where the hype is still real, but, it doesn't stand up to The options of the Las Vegas strip.",3
The burger part is amazing.  Wahlburger sauce is delicious!,5
Tattertots and burgers! Clean fast delicious food! Fries could be a bit more crisp otherwise a great sports/ burger joint,4
"Ricky was amazing!! We had 30 of us from the softball showcase and they got us all in, service was amazing and quick, food was fantastic. Again Ricky made this such a fantastic experience. Thank you from Colorado!! Wahlburgers was a great time and a delicious dinner!! Staff is AMAZING!!",5
"Great service, the burger was really pretty good..I didn't care for the b&b pickels, but the beef was cooked perfect and the veggies were fresh and good all in all a pretty good burger",4
"One of the best burgers I've ever had. It was so good I went twice during my 3 day vacation. $13 for the best burger. I had the BBQ and the fiesta burger, both did not disappoint and the sweet potato tots were amazing. Great shakes and absolutely loved that you get to keep the beverage cups that are a nice plastic quality. Will definitely go Everytime I go back to vegas",5
First time trying Whalburger. The burger was good but not much better than average. The tater tots tasted frozen. Davina did not come to check on us & rang up our check incorrect. She also had an attitude when we nicely pointed it out to her.,3
Excellent burgers and the truffle tots are 🔥! Will definitely be back!,5
Great food and drinks. The fried spinach is delicious. The tater tots were the best. The hamburger was really good as well.  The prices are very reasonable. I will definitely be back every time I go to Vegas,5
"A bit pricier than other burger joints but completely worth it.

Customer service was outstanding, the employees are quick to do there job and the customer service is exceptional.
We got our food very quickly and my kids enjoyed it as well.

Fun atmosphere, with a bar as well. Wahlburg brothers posters and cool places to take pics.

Healthy and vegetarian selections as well. We will be back. Thank you .",5
Great food 👌 but horrible service especially for the place not being overly busy. Would love to try a different location,4
"Overall 4/5: Stopped by for a light snack and were not disappointed!

Drinks 4/5: We also ordered two rounds of drinks. The first was royapple flush, strawberry daiquiris, and the Tamarind Mezwahl. The royapple was cool, it had little frozen apples in it and crown apple as the liquor. Nice and refreshing. The strawberry daiquiris were just what we needed, nice and cooling. It was over 100° that day; they were also very strong. The Tamarind Mezwahl had awesome flavor on it.

Food 4/5: We ordered the our burger, sweet chili glazed chicken tenders, tater tots, french fries, and sweet potato tots. The our burger was good, perfectly cooked. The fries, tater tots, and sweet potato tots were all okay. A little under seasoned for my liking. The star of the night though was the sweet chili glazed chicken tenders. The tenders were perfectly moist and the sauce on them were great. They were nicely sized to where the sauce on it was just enough.

Service 5/5: Our server was super cool. We really liked him, he was patient and gave good recommendations for drinks. Everything came out pretty fast. It was pretty busy, but they were quick to seat us and never felt unattended to.

Environment 3/5: Pretty decent in there. Kind of sticky on the tables. Felt like your average burger place. Not bad though.

Thank you, Wahlburgers!",4
"The PAUL burger is absolutely amazing. I loved it, it was seasoned, had flavor and presentable. It was stinky outside though. The place is located near a bathroom so I assumed that is why it smelled like STRONG POOP . The fries was under cooked. Shockingly this was one of the best places  I ate while visiting",5
"first of all, I have been to this location before and it was good. a bit over priced, but good.
I recently went with family. not expecting anything special, just a decent burger.
wow, the food was absolutely disgusting. my wife's turkey burger was burned I'm talking about black burned. sent back and replaced with a salad. it was also bad. my burger was made with obviously frozen bargain beef. it was thinner than a McDonald's cheese burger. it was so bad that I could not eat it. the rest of the family's food was just as bad. there were 4 adults and I'm the only one with a beer.. all of this was $115.00. outrageous.  don't waste our money!!",1
"The BEST onion rings ever, anywhere. Love this place as it’s in a convenient location - don’t have to enter a Hotel/Casino to access. Great variety of menu items at reasonable prices. You may want to check availability for this location first, especially if you have a larger group. Outdoor seating available but with limited space. Shopping next door in case you get bored waiting for a table.",4
"I came here a couple of years ago on a previous trip and it was a great experience, but I will say I no longer feel this way. The experience changed drastically as opposed to the first time.

Originally it was counter serve and quick, but now orders are taken at the table, which isn’t really a problem, but is different. The probably that I experienced was in the food size. The first time I had a fair sized burger that was delicious. I recommended others here and was excited to come back myself.

However, this is 2nd time I came back the burger was tiny. After tax and tip my burger came out to $24 and it was the size of a double cheeseburger from McDonald’s. Not at all worth the price and that’s just the burgers, it costs extra to add fries or tots. Like the idea of the place, but just not at all worth the price. Plenty of other options nearby.",2
"Our first visit to Whalburger's, the food was delicious.  It was an average burger BUT I can tell it was fresh and the seasoning was on point.  My wife got the ""gluten free"" burger and she enjoyed the ""secret sauce"" which is basically a thousand island dressing. This is a place I would definitely visit again.  The tater tots with truffle aoli were delicious.  In Vegas, the atmosphere is more of a ""party"" atmosphere and I get that.  Would be nice to visit a location off the strip.  Good job Whalburgs keep up the good work and open a location in New Braunfels or San Antonio soon!",5
"It's always a pleasure to visit the Wahlburgers in Vegas. I wish we could package this one up and bring it to Atlanta. The one in Atlanta is nothing like this one at all! Food, service, atmosphere...all different and not in a good way. Anyway, the food was great at this one and the drinks were on point as usual!!!",5
"9:30 am & we got to have a burger for my husband’s birthday breakfast.  Delicious!  Was made & cooked perfectly.  Very clean, fast service.  Our server Daniel was EXCELLENT…very helpful, friendly, & even took a pic with us :-)
Definitely recommend this Vegas sight.  Thank you Wahlburger for a great first experience!",5
Been here twice and was amazing both times. Burgers are very good quality and were cooked how we ordered.  Sauce is pleasant and goes well with the gov cheese and generous veggies. One of my top burgers for sure!   🤌🤌,5
"Expensive for the quality of food. Our food was very greasy, we couldn’t finish. Although the food did come out fast, and the service was outstanding. The reason for the 2 stars is because of the price to eat here. Wahlburger’s is open late and was near our hotel. We were definitely not expecting for our bill to be $105 for 3 people. Just was not worth it.",2
Great OFD burger! Daniel provided great service,5
"Ate here on a Friday night, just after midnight. We were seated pretty quickly, waited maybe 5 mins max. We were served iced water (very good) while we looked over the menu. I got the ‘OFB’ burger and plain tots as a side, both were very good and a decent portion if you are hungry like I was. Had a taste of the plain fries and they were not good, do not recommend
thos e  wait for the food was not long, impressive considering all the to-go orders they were putting out as well! Price was a bit high for what you’re getting, ~$20 for both items, but what can you expect from a restaurant on the strip? Our server was very attentive and nice, I’m sorry I didn’t catch her name but she did a great job. Decor and ambiance not very interesting. The drinks coming out of the bar looked tasty but didn’t try any this time around.",4
"Numerous other reviews on this place already. But the food was pretty good overall. Each item is separate when choosing/paying (ex. burger does not come with fries, must get that seperate). Overall, would recommend though and return.",4
Great lunch spot! Affordable prices good portions🍔🍟 very close walking distance from Bally's Hotel,5
"Food was amazing, service was quick and price was great. Would definitely come back again.",5
"Okay, so my Our Burger was good although i ordered it as medium and it came closer to the far end of medium well to well done! Yukon Fries were run of the mill fries...nothing to call home about..the Bacon mac n cheese was alright as well. The service however left a lot to be desired...they were nice enough but terrible about checking on us and had to track them down for refills and asked 3x for the check!",3
"Always wanted to try a burger here and recently got the chance.
I tried ""the impossible"" burger ($20) which is a plant based patty option which was awesome! Tried it here instead of Burger King and was not disappointed. Also tried tatter tots and the thin onion rings. Tots were standard, nothing different or special (would recommend a twist by Chef Paul) but the thinly sliced onion rings were delicious. Food prices are on the heavier side because it is located on the Strip but well worth the sampling. I enjoyed my meal here. It's not a large interior space, has a bar (surprise, available alcohol) with seating around it and limited exterior tables. Because I ate after 9pm, I didn't have an issue waiting in line, obtaining a booth or waiting for the food to arrive. Souvenirs are available here. Go online to the company website, sign up and receive free food. Review the menu and be better prepared to order upon arrival to your restaurant as this business is growing in its venue locations across the country. So if you're not able to make it to this location, maybe your hometown or a closer city has a restaurant, pop in and check it out!",5
"Great customer service! The Thanksgiving Turkey Burger was Amazing. Flavor in every bite! I love how the orange-cranberry sauce and roasted butternut squash just takes the flavor of the burger to whole new taste. I honestly don't ever finish an entire burger but this one, I Sure did! That's how good the burger was!",5
Great tasting burger,5
"Loved this restaurant! The service was impeccable. We were sat quickly for lunch and almost immediately were introduced to our server.  She was graceful, answered all of our questions with a smile and made some recommendations based on the questions.  While we waited for lunch, a photographer came over and took our picture with permission. My friend and I soon received our meals.  We loved them.  Everything was super fresh.  The food was delicious and we did not have to wait long any all.  After dinner the photographer returned with a free picture of us in a cute Wahlburger frame.  We had the option to buy other photos, but we declined.  It was a fun lunch with great food and customer service.  I would highly recommend it!",5
"We were so excited to try this place, but the food was horrible.  My wife's turkey burger had a weird odor, she took a bite and it was spoiled.  They put cheese on my daughters hamburger, so we had to wait for a new one.  Then I got my chicken sandwich and it was dry and had no flavor.  I would highly recommend skipping this place!",1
"Being a celebrity owned restaurant I thought it would be better. It was honestly just okay, mediocre. Fries were an extra cost and nothing special, again: mediocre. The burger patty was over cooked and a bit dry. My husband got a bacon burger and super small for the price. I wouldn't come back",3
Tried this place for the first time.  Unfortunately not impressed. Same vegan burger at Burger King for less than half the price. $18 for a vegan burger that is average size and average taste was disappointing.  Onion rings where ok.,3
"Our server Daniel was super sweet and fast! He took such good care of us, made menu recommendations and checked on us constantly. If I come back I will only sit in his section! The food was good! Glad we tried it while in the area.",5
"This place never disappoints.

Been here a few times, I enjoy the burgers, fries and drinks.
The atmosphere is also nice, you can see all the family references, etc.",5
Excellent burgers I will definitely come back. Thank you very much wahlburger family.,5
"It was good, properly cook to order. The only hang up is 12 bucks for a 2 dollar burger from Wendy’s. Fry’s ordinary and taste old and cold.

Chili is very good!

Service is good!",3
"Food is delicious here! If you love burgers, this is a place you must try while you're in Las Vegas. Not very expensive and portions are great. Staff was very friendly and restaurant is kept very clean. It can get very busy here during the day so plan ahead.",5
Great food. Great atmosphere. Service was excellent. Burgers were very juicy with enough flavor. 5 stars all around.,5
"My flight was cancelled so I was left in Vegas for another day. Wahlburgers has been on my bucket list for some time and they've been in a few cities I've traveled in, but I've never actually managed to get stopped in to try it. This was my first experience.

You need reservations to dine-in with the whole Covid-19 thing going on, and it appeared all of the staff kept their masks on appropriately. I ended up sitting at the bar, and truth be told though some screws were coming loose out of the big rounded silver metal bars (I didn't snap a pic) as they were loose when I grabbed them. The bartender, Chrisheta, was great and friendly. She even let me have some leftover mango margarita to try after making a drink. She was the best part of the trip, and if I was going to return it was because of her.

I ordered 'The Our Burger' with it's proprietary blend of fresh Angus brisket, short rib, and chuck 1/3 lb burger. It didn't take long to come out and the place wasn't busy. It was a wee little thing and at first thought I might've been given a kids burger by mistake, but alas she wasn't gonna get any bigger folks. She was a show-er with everything she had. The burger taste wasn't spectacular, but it also wasn't terrible. The wahl sauce was good but honestly was sparce to hardly taste it so I'm glad I asked the chipotle mayo. It was a good burger, but I didn't take a bite and go ""wow, WHATABURGER!?"" For nearly $13 after taxes WITHOUT fries or a drink  included in that price I took a bite and went ""oh, WALLburger."" I left hungry, no doubt, but also felt like Marky Mark just slammed me into a wall and took my lunch money.",3
The food was good.  My issue was with the souvenir cup. First they charge $14 for a drink with a souvenir cup. Yes it’s plastic. Yes it’s from China but I wanted it for my collection. The waiter didn’t tell me they were out of the glasses with the name on them until after it was ordered and drank. I was thinking the glass would come separate. I wouldn’t have gotten the overpriced drink had I known that.  For $65 for burgers and fries and don’t forget the misleading souvenir drink I guess you pay for the name.,2
MY GOD IS THIS PLACE GOOD. This place is a must! The food is really good and the service is phenomenal shout out to DANIEL! He was so amazing! <3 Thank you so much!,5
Sweet potato tots were the bomb. Burger was just right and the cobb salad was nice and filling.,5
"I'd say everything here was about what you'd expect at a ""step above fast food"" type of burger place. The burgers were good, fries good, the salad was more than iceberg lettuce and carrot shreds. It was all perfectly fine. Nothing really stood out either way.

If you're looking for something exciting, this isn't it. If you want something that is going to be decent, reliable, and a short wait, then this is a safe bet.

Restrooms around corner, indoor and outdoor seating.",3
"Best breakfast sandwich we've had! We were in Vegas for a few days, and I had no idea Wahlburgers was even there, until we came off the tram and cut through Bally's to head towards strip - and there it was! We stopped here for breakfast (and even went back for breakfast another day!), and were not disappointed. The breakfast sandwich was a tasty sausage patty, with cheese and an over medium egg on a bun with sriracha ketchup. It was an incredible flavor, we'd highly recommend people check it out!",5
"Was able to get in at 10:00 am on a Saturday! Service was outstanding! The food was excellent, my husband had the Festive Hamburger, bowl of chili. I had the Swiss mushroom burger and tater tots. The food was excellent! My husband said he wasn’t real sure about going here! But said he was surprised that it was so good! I have been going here ever since it’s opening! When I go with the OutLaw  for our yearly Las Vegas trip it’s a must for dinner or lunch! Never a bad meal!",5
"Wahlburgers was ok, I didn't order much. My Caesar salad and creamsicle float were basic but filled me up for the night. As I waited for my order, I noticed the service wasn't great, yet the burgers looked pretty good.",3
"$5 for 2 beers, $5 shots and some killer mixed drinks! Bartenders are awesome! I will definitely be stopping in the next time I'm on the Strip 🤫 😎",5
Excellent food and service if you are on the hunt for a good burger when on the strip be sure to hit this place up you won't regret it.,5
"Yummy food and drinks. Nice outdoor seating, friendly service.",5
"First time eating at Wahlburgers. I ordered the impossible burger, which my friends have been requesting me to try. Possibly one of the best burger I’ve tried. Nothing taste differently. The “meat” looked & tasted just like beef. Very soft and moist as you bite into the burger. I will definitely eat at Wahlburgers again. Especially, knowing that there’s this great vegan burger.",5
"Such a cool place to eat, top five best burgers I’ve ever had in my life.",5
The burgers were ok.  Not as good as five guys.  Service took forever.  All in all...it's ok.  Not worth the hype or expense though.,4
"Had a fantastic waiter. The restaurant was super busy, but he never failed in paying attention to our table. Had some beer, with buffalo chicken dip and chips. A great burger and the Mac and cheese. The food was great I would highly recommend eating here.",5
"The burgers are delicious, I hadn't wanted to try this place because I figured it was another celebrity creating a restaurant just because but this place doesn't disappoint. The tater tots are crispy, the shake is tasty, and the burgers are juicy.",4
My wife went to the Wahlburgers at the mall of America and couldn’t stop raving about it. So when she saw it in Vegas she was excited to share it with me. Sadly our experience at the Vegas location was nothing like her previous one. My burger was super thin. The veggies on the burger overpowered the thin patty. Onion rings were pretty good and the spicy margarita was okay.,2
"Awesome hamburgers, great people!",5
I heard many good reviews but mines wasn't good at all. That $15 burger was smaller than the kids burger and theirs came with fries. The burger was then like steak and shake burger but much smaller.,1
The onion rings were the best part.,5
"Someone came to our table to take pictures of us. They returned with them and asked if we wanted to buy them for 40$. They were not good quality photos and they were edited horribly, we declined. The ""photographer"" then started getting really sad and tried to make us feel sorry for her and asked if we would at least pay 5$ for them?! What a freaking SCAM. We didn't want them taken in the first place. DON'T SCAM YOUR CUSTOMERS.",1
"Fantastic customer service. My friend had the mushroom burger and loved it as well as great onion rings. I loved the macaroni salad but wasn't crazy about my burger. It was dense and not as juicy as I would have liked. The bun was also dense and more like a cheap bun  Perhaps asking for it to be cooked medium meant that it was overcooked. I gave 4 stars for the overall experience, but if I was only rating my own burger I'd give it 2 stars.",4
"The burgers were really good, on the expensive side I thought but very tasty.  You have to pay extra for a side.  And if you want a refill on your drink (on alcoholic drink) you have to pay for that as well.  Can't say I have ever eaten at a restaurant where you pay for your drink refill, but okay.  The service was good, once our server came to take our order.  Granted, the restaurant WAS busy but it did take awhile for us to be waited on.  So if you don't mind all those negative issues and want a good burger I say GO FOR IT!",3
The service is fast and very friendly. Drinks were great and burgers were incredibly juicy. Highly recommend 👍,5
Love this place!  Friendly bartender and good food.  Try the spicy cheese & bacon tots and the Supermelt!,5
"We recently had a chance to try Wahlburgers during our trip to Las Vegas.  If you are looking for it then look right across the street from the fountain at Bellagio.  We decided to try The Super Melt with a side order of tater tots and a bowl of chili, yummy!
The burger is a massive delight for the taste buds.  We even had to get a to go box.  However not a drop of chili was left uneaten.

The restaurant is very clean and provides a low key environment.  The perfect place to take a break from the lights and sounds of the casinos.

We were shown to a booth by a friendly, bubbly young lady.  We could tell by the employees they were all very happy to be there.",5
"Double decker with government cheese, truffle fries and a side coke please!",5
"This place was kind of a let down. My BBQ burger tasted great, but it was tiny when compared to others you can get for that price, plus the fries are sold separately. As for the service, another tables server was having to constantly grab our because of how often they would disappear. Shout out to that server with the east coast accent, not sure of your name but you are appreciated.",3
"After getting to our table and waiting 20 min, the hostess came to our table and gave us complimentary water. Yes I said correctly  complimentary water... water is supposed to be free.
After waiting 5 more our waitress finaly come to out table and
Did not apologize for taking so long. Asked us what we wanted. Once we got our food. The burgers we ordered  were just like any other fast food burger.  In and out was better tasting. Our bill came to 51.00 for just 2 burgers and 2 sides of fries,  and one appetizer.  Nothing else to drink  but our complimentary water.  Definitely  would not recommend  this place.",1
"Seriously the best burger.  Wife and I were both shocked at how good it was.  My new favorite place for a burger.

The bun, the cheese, the fresh jalapeno.  It was perfect!

It took a little while cause it was busy but it was worth it.",5
I had the OFD burger. Was awesome. Added some lettuce and tomatoes. Meat was perfect medium and tasted great. With that an Whalbrewsk local beer that matched perfectly.,5
"Good food overall, small burgers. Over all if I am going to pay over $70 for food, you could have a bathroom here.",3
"The burgers are amazing! The waitress told us the melt was the most popular. We had it, and were not disappointed. The meat was very tender. It blended with the cheese for a unique hearty taste. The mac and cheese was also very good, with bacon, and white cheese. The ambiance was reminiscent of a sports bar, and the service was good.",5
My fiance and I ate here while on vacation.  We were greatly disappointed. We ordered several different items just to try them. The only thing that was really worth the money was the Mac n cheese. Staff was polite and courteous but not very quick or attentive.,3
Been here twice now and the food is super good! It is on the pricey side but still good food! We had our burgers out within 5 minutes of placing our order! Burgers average between $11-19. Drinks are also expensive $10+,5
I couldnt believe just how special this resturaunt really is. The view we had alone was to die for let alone the food was great and we had the best waitress. Hands down this is a must if you visit las vegas. I will be going back for sure,5
"We came here on a late Saturday night.  We ordered a bacon cheese burger, crispy onion strings and also a smahlburger with fries from the kids menu (because I have dental problem). The waiting staff is so nice to let me do that.  The food came very fast and the service was really good.  The portion is very generous. Beef is very fluffy fresh and tasty. The bun is also very soft and nice. The burger is so tasty I don’t need to put on any ketchup or condiments. Fries are fresh cut.  Onion strings are the best.  I give it a 5-star rating.  I’ll be back tomorrow.",5
Fantastic place. Great food. Great quality. Great experience. Couldn't sing enough praise.,5
"Daniel was an outstanding server. He made sure to go the extra mile for our group, fast service and refills, sweet and prompt. We will definitely be back",5
My husband and I came here. The scenery was awesome and the food was great :) Service was awesome as well.,5
"Come on a recommendation from a friend (said that they were consistently good). We had the Our burger, fiesta burger, and the tot flight trio. All was well cooked and tasted great. Loved the truffle tots best! Would eat here again.",5
"Nothing impressive. Don’t waste your money. We were really disappointed 😔hamburgers dry, without any flavor. The only good thing was our waiter, he was nice explaining the menu and friendly.",1
"Overall a disappointing experience. The atmosphere was pleasant and for the most part the restaurant was clean. Our food was average to good for some in our party and for one person the burger came out rare instead of medium.  Not a great impression by needing to send back an order the first time you dine somewhere, and in Vegas. The worst part was the picture. They do the amusement park park style group picture of your table for free and you get a free postcard as well but the hard sale.on the $15 photo was too much and completely off putting. It basically ruined the experience for our group. I love the show and the brand before the visit....a little less now. 🙁",3
"Great burgers and sweet potato tots.  Was a little let down about the ofd burger.  Supposed to hsve tomato jam and forgot to put it on.  Fast, speedy service.  Great waiter.",4
"Food was alright, but being harassed by a photographer to buy photos from her as we are trying to have a nice and relaxing meal Kinda dulled it for me. The waitress was great though!! Very kind and helpful.",3
"Great burger. The buns was good too!
Had some tots with it and they didn’t disappoint.",5
"OMG!!! I didn't expect too much, since it is a burger place. My bad! It was so delicious!!! The tater tots were crispy, the sweet potato tots were flavorful. The burgers were juicy and lots of flavor as well. I had the Super Melt and added an egg. It was the best burger I have had in a very long time. We also got the chili, my husband loved it. I ordered the bacon cheese mac and I could not stop eating it. We purchases some cupcakes but we were so full we took them to go. That will be updated later. I totally recommend Wahlburgers!",5
"Was seated fast, food came quick.  Ordered onion strings with burger....  fried in burnt oil.",4
"Honestly kind of disappointed, this is my second time to this location, first time I had no issue. Today I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar.. The chicken was about 2 maybe 3 ounces of meat that was so over cooked it was dry. Then with what little lettuce I received I also got a HANDFUL of finely grated Parmesan. The fries were flavorless rocks and it was just all around lackluster. The only reason they get 3 stars is because their customer service.",3
"I am a HUGE fan of the show, the family, and their story. I made my family walk the Strip so we could go to Wahlburgers. We all got something different and bought tons of sides. I was heartbroken that my burger was nothing more special than any burger place. The sweet potato tots were mushy- the only thing we got excited about we're the crispy onion rings. Those were the bomb. Underwhelmed.",3
This was our first time at Wahlburgers and Daniel was an amazing server! He’s was very kind and provided great customer service! The food was amazing and so were the drinks!,5
Food was amazing.  Our server Daniel was amazing and so patient.   Will definitely be back on the next trip!,5
"Great place, great food!! Daniel was a great server with awesome customer service.. Will recommend friends and family to give it a try.",5
Great burger! Went for a quick bite after a long day of walking up and down the strip in Vegas. Barbecue bacon burger was fabulous! But I can pass on the fries. The host and staff were very friendly. The drinks were a bit too pricey.,4
The service was so good that we left a 33% tip.,5
"Great place to go for a good burger.  Truffle tater tots are the way to go.  We were seated quickly no wait time, which is great considering a lot of places in Vegas had a 30 min to 2 hour wait time.  Staff was friendly, food was better than some other more expensive options.  Would come back again.",5
"It was good, service was quick, but they didn't have public restrooms, which frankly is odd for a dine in establishment.",4
It was good! Service was super fast and friendly!,4
This place is my go to when I’m in Vegas! On Keto while vacationing in Vegas?! Look no further to stop by Wahlburgers and get you a Wahlburgers Salad!! It is so delicious and I was so happy that I found it. It’s the only meal I pretty much want to eat when I visit. Wahlburgers shared my photo on IG which made me so happy ❤️,5
I went hear twice during my last Vegas trip. I had a burger day 1 and it was very good. The next day I went and had the chicken salad it was also very good. Definitely worth checking out. And if you're looking for a good deal on beers their corner Bar is where it's at.,4
"Friendly staff.  Burger was good, but not the best.  Good fresh ingredients used.  The potato bun really shined, jalepanos were super fresh.  Was expecting (not more salty) but bigger flavor.  Paid about $23 for one burger, soda and fries before tip.  Worth going once to day you been here.  Still a good burger.",4
Really enjoyed tge atmosphere and the food was fantastic. Dinner and drinks.,5
"Daniel was a great server. Visiting from Augusta GA.
Mr. Wahlburger, you got a really good burger. Jenn's chicken was the tops also.",5
Had high hopes for some late night grub but this place was terrible.  Ordered the Impossible burger (for  $18.95) and when it arrived I thought maybe they were mistaken and had brought me something from the kids menu. It was the tiniest burger I’ve ever had. Maybe enough to feed a child but even that is a stretch. Super disappointing. On top of that it wasn’t even tasty. One of the worst burgers I’ve ever had. Not worth the money. The menu is a la carte as well so no side. The $4.95 for the cup of tater tots was much more worth the money than the burger (and more filling). Not worth the hype and not worth your money when there are so many options in Vegas.,1
Excellent burgers! Good price and flavor,5
It was our first time coming here .. we were exciting to try this place out .. didn't realize they charge for each food items like fries or onion rings .. they charge around 5 dollar for those and it's a small portion of order fries or tater tots . I think onion rings are in good size portion   and drinks come with free souvenir cup cost around 5 dollar as well .. free refill which is good thing lol. Burgers wasn't a big size   it like almost the size of McDonald .. cost between 12-14 .. overall it does taste good and have their own flavor .. sadly Those food got me sick dunno why .. my husband love it .. the check came out almost 45 dollar for 2 burgers and fries with one drink .. It's an experience to try this out but won't come back,3
"I had the Smoked Bacon 🥓 Arugula salad. I had them put ranch dressing on it instead. I did not like the squishy- spongy apples in the salad, I would’ve preferred fresh apples in the salad. The Customer service was excellent, thank you.",5
Food was great but SO EXPENSIVE!!!  We had the basic burger and water and it was $28!!!!  No fries or sides.....just a burger 🍔,4
"The food was amazing! We went on Friday night - it wasn’t too packed, we were able to get a seat in about 15 minutes for a party of 6.

The vibe was really cool inside.

It was one of the best burgers I have had.

Very clean. The staff were extremely friendly.

I’ll be back!",5
"Unimpressed, basically an expensive trap for drunk tourists. The only thing I regret doing in Vegas, lol.",2
Came here last year right before the covid restrictions and it was the best burger i have ever had.. Really expensive and busy but well worth it.. The service was amazing also.,5
"For dinner my husband and I were seated pretty quick, and we got a free postcard with our picture which is a nice touch. There are posters all over with Walburg on them.
I think this place is . . . a lot of hype but not as much backing it up. The food was quality and staff was nice. I ordered the Thanksgiving burger and it was a good mash of flavors but by the time it got to the table it was nearly room temperature. Perhaps it's just the nature of stuffing and cranberry sauce, they cool quick. The lemonade was nice and tart, good stuff and we got to take home our green cups. Fries were mediocre as well.
A decent meal, but not quite what I was hoping for.
(the hot dog I had around the corner at dirt dog was way more satisfying)",3
Went tot he restaurant sat outside it was fine but the server forgot our water.  The fried pickles and fries were very old.  They didn't taste very good. I got a salmon and it was not good at all.  I was looking forward to eating here and I was very disappointed.,1
One of the best burgers ever! The pickles....so delicious!! The only thing that I didn't like about the place was it was very loud inside so we had to almost yell to talk to each other. Loved the pictures on the wall and our server was attentive and friendly.,5
Wahlburgers is the best burger bar i have ever been to. The burgers are pefect all round. Loved the onion rings. People do yourself a favor and visit Wahlburgers for an experience.,5
So we were vacationing in Las Vegas and one of our places to eat in our list was at Wahlburgers— so we went — it was the best experience eating burgers ever! From the welcoming courteousness of the personnel to the attentiveness of the servers and last but top of the list — the food — kuddos to chef Paul for his recipes on making the best burgers I’ve eaten anywhere! The experience was unequivocally the best! Thank you!,5
"Wahlburgers are mad good!! It's like they were perfectly designed to go with a nice cold beer 🍻 The setting here is really neat and clean. Menu is super simple. Location is convenient. There's a cool patio and bar area. The staff here is really nice, they actually took great care of me when let's say 'being in Vegas' set in. Definitely coming here again when I'm in town!",5
"A disappointing experience and mediocre meal. I’ll give you a story line of events.
-My wife and I arrive. The hostess was polite upon arrival. She walks us back to our seats. She just leaves with no comment. Even after we said thank you. No response or “Enjoy your meal”. No big deal, but a little off putting, but it did lead in to the other customer service issues.
- We wait for 10 minutes with no one speaking or greeting us. Mind you, the restaurant is full, but the waiter serving the area was active in his location. He walked by us at least 5 times until he finally said hello and would be with us shortly. We smile and say okay.
- The waiter that greeted us never comes back. Even though he’s in the area we get another server. We order our food. My wife orders a well done burger, sauce on the side, no tomatoes. I try to make it easy. A medium cooked cheese burger with everything on it.
- the wait wasn’t bad but both burgers are medium. One has no sauce at all and the other has it liberally. Tomatoes in both. A little disappointing.
- When our food arrived I ask for a knife. The server says sure and leaves. I never received that knife.

Food Quality: average. Our orders were slightly incorrect so that didn’t help, but the burger was plain. You can get much better burgers in Vegas from Bobby Flays or Gordon Ramsey’s. Similar prices, better taste, and service.  We ordered onion RINGS. They came back as little fried onion strips in a basket. I could look passed them being different than my expectations, if they tasted good. They didn’t. They were bland, dry, and the size of the strips makes it as if your eating fried breading with a hair of onion inside. The fries were fine.

TLDR: Wahlburgers today gave mediocre service that was slow, apathetic, and forgetful. Food was generic and not worth the price. There are better burger places in Vegas that can take your time and money. We are Vegas regulars and polite diners, but this was annoying and surprising enough for me to warn those that make this part of your Vegas trip.",3
"Tried the OFD and the Double Decker, both were delicious with two large beef patties.  Bacon Mac and fries were delicious too.  Must try if you haven’t before.",5
Super friendly and attentive staff. Awesome food. Really impressed and will return. Looking forward to the DC and Ballston locations opening.,5
Fast and friendly service. The fried pickles are great. The Impossible burger is very flavorful and delicious. Would not recommend the onion rings. They are red onions shredded and cooked in a light batter. They don't seem to be seasoned and don't taste too good but that's no show stopper. Try the wahlburgers if you have the chance.,5
Hamburger tasted great and tater tots were too! I found this place walking past. Will definitely try again!,5
"There are waaaaay better burgers for less money on the strip.

The burgers taste like fast food burger with bacon",1
"Didn't see Mark or Donnie, service was a bit rushed, appetizers came out then food right after. Food, Experience, Service was pretty much expected for Vegas on this day. Convenient location, kids enjoyed.",3
Great burger!  Great staff! Sweet potatoes tater tots were tasty! I ordered regular cheeseburger with avocado. I highly recommend to check out this spot if you love burgers.,4
This place is phenomenal! If you think it's just the hype because of the name. Yeah the Wahlburgers are amazing people and we all love Marky Mark! But trust me I'm a big burger fanatic and man is their burger amazing!!! I absolutely loved everything about it plus you get tater tots with your burger instead of fries I'm in heaven. Also tried the bacon mac and cheese pretty bomb but stick to the amazing burgers they have!,5
"Not the best location but the burgers and tots are awesome for a quicker, casual place.",4
"The double burger was perfect, delicious! Really liked the onion rings. Not fond of the ranch, too much vinegar.",5
Never disappoints!,5
"$19 for a fairly plain burger. No fries or any sides served with it. Absurdly overpriced. (Edit following the owner's reply): It was an Impossible Burger, and I know those are always more expensive than actual meat for some reason, but I'd still expected more than just a burger in a bun with a bit of relish inside it.",3
Great food... Fast service!,5
"On our Vegas wedding trip. Our group unanimously agreed that Wahlbugers food and service was the best.  Burgers, salads, drinks; all delicious and affordable.",5
"I debated writing this review but my friend who referred us said yes write it. On 8/6/2021 my daughter, her friend and I went to Vegas and for dinner we were excited to try Wahlburgers. The 3 of us came to a unanimous decision that this place was not good. The fries were beyond bland as well as our burgers. We were very disappointed and didn’t even eat all of it. Sad I wasted my money here 😢
The server was the only upside, very personable and welcoming! Next time in Vegas we won’t be eating there.",2
"Wahlburgers had always been one of our ""Must Go"" places when visiting Las Vegas, but it has changed, and not necessarily for the better.
Previously you would walk in, place your order, find a seat, refill your cup as needed and it was reasonably priced. Now, they seat you, you order at the table and wait for them to refill your drink. The prices seem to have increased which I'm guessing is to make up the difference with the table service.
4 hamburgers, 4 drinks and 2 fries to share cost us $89.31.  That was a bit steep for hamburgers for kids, when ""In n Out"" is $4 for a hamburger, which our teens said they prefer. I prefer Wahlburgers, however.
We went on a Monday about 11:15 am and we're the only people there for our entire meal. The server was VERY KIND. The staff members are welcoming and helpful, but the fact that there is no parking remotely close by (we parked in the structure at Bally's, $12 for the first 4 hours) and the worst part--NO PUBLIC RESTROOM, made the experience quite frustrating. The men's room is on the opposite side of the escalator, and the ladies room is under the public stairwell. The ladies room reminded me of a public restroom in an older San Francisco park: no toilet paper, no paper towels to dry your hands, flickering lights and some kind of liquid puddled on the floors.
The food is good, but for this kind of money, parking and an accessable restroom are really a MUST.
To make this stop worth while on your Vegas journey, Uber here. 👍",3
"Great service coupled with good food and a lively, upbeat energetic atmosphere made for a great experience!
I got the bbq bacon burger which was very tasty and filling. My wife got the thanksgiving turkey burger and sweet potatoes tots and liked it. She said it was a little bland and without flavor, wished it had more cranberry sauce but at the same time enjoyed it. Speedy service and server was very welcoming. One issue was that they don’t have onsite toilets, so had to walk out of restaurant to go to the toilet.",5
Ordered the fried pickles and literally got maybe 10. $1 per pickle. Come on marky mark. Not having good vibrations or sweet sensations.,1
Oh my goodness the best pickles I have ever had. Great service and the burgers are spectacular,5
"The double cheeseburger was good, but I have had better. The chili was ok but too spicy for my liking. I asked for some sour cream to tone it down, but they didn't have any. The overall experience was average and nothing special. I expected more from all the hype.",3
"Well there is nothing exceptional about these burgers. I got the “our house” and the flavor was lame, not even good. The bread was kind of hard. They are very pricey for the quality they offer. I would not recommend this place. Go better to McDonald’s",1
Their burgers are absolutely delicious. The bums have a homemade tomato sauce that makes the whole burger taste amazing. Ferry fresh and quick service.,5
This was undoubtedly the absolute best burger I had while on a recent road trip. The restaurant is in a great central location on the strip. The staff were quick and efficient as well as friendly. Prices were reasonable considering how awesome the burger was. Can't wait to eat here again someday.,5
"Great burgers, service can be better but in the end great spot to eat and get drinks. 👌💯",5
"Was very excited to try this place ... as huge fans of them and as business owners.  Service was underwhelming and food was okay, but cold.  We sat at the bar and bartender was far more interested in flirting with other patrons than our service.  I understand being short-staffed during this time, but there should still be a minimal level of customer service.  So disappointed.",2
"Great service. Great burgers and mac and cheese. Onion rings were good but a bit greasy. Serving size of onion rings is perfect for two, too much for one person. Best burger I've had in a long time.",5
"Even though we have one in Detroit, I've never been to Wahlburgers before. The burgers were just fantastic, as were the fries and thin onion rings. Got a specialty drink, and wasn't disappointed in that either. Difficult to find a great burger place, but this place has them!! Service was awesome, very attentive to our every need. Would definitely visit again!!",5
"Excellent food and friendly staff.
Edit: the Portobelo sandwich is not available anymore, which is a shame because it was a great vegetarian option. I ordered the Impossible burger on my last visit, it was good. Tasted just like meat, consistency was a bit bland. An extra minute on the grill for extra crunchyness and it has nothing to envy a real meat burger.",5
Good food as usual. Some lady kept asking to take our picture though which was uncomfortable once we said no the first time.,4
"We were not disappointed. The atmosphere and food were amazing. The Our burger was juicy and cooked to order. Thin onion rings were crispy and delish dipped in wahl sauce. Normally I don't like mac n cheese at a restaurant but here it was amazing. Definitely will be back next time we are visiting. Now.. can you please open a location in Houston, TX?!",5
"If you are a fan of Mark Wahlberg, you have to visit this place. Food was good. We ordered chicken sandwich with onion rings and potato tots. Food was served in like 10 min. Servers were welcoming, and the prices were not expensive at all.
Our chicken sandwich was around $13. It’s really close to the strip, just next to Bally’s. There were lot of burger options in the menu. Worth trying!!",4
Tasty hamburgers! You should try the thin onion rings.,4
"The food was okay, nothing impressive. Fine if you're looking for a greasy burger and fries that are overpriced. Four of us paid about $100 for food comparable to McDonald's. Biggest issue for me was that there is no a/c, it was just as hot inside as it was outside, and at 110 degrees, I want to enjoy a meal while I cool off.",2
Most of the food was great! The cinnamon tots were amazing! The burgers and chicken sandwiches were great. The fries were terrible. The service was awesome.,5
"I had the Double Decker and it was amazing! Ricardo, our waiter was awesome! My fiancé 😍 had the Melt, which was a homerun! Make sure you get a selfie with Mark!",5
The food was spot on and the service by Daniel could not have been better! What an attentive server and so friendly!,5
Very yummy burgers & drinks too! Kinda on the expensive side since you have to order everything separately but for me the taste is worth it.,4
"Super Tasty. Went around 11 for lunch and it wasn’t too crowed, like everything else in the area. 👍🏻",5
"Food was pretty good, very pricey. Souvenir ""glass"" for their cocktails is actually plastic and shows ""made in china"" on the bottom, kinda disappointing. Don't consider that a souvenir.
Waiter did get our checks messed up with a party of 7 but he handled it well and got it sorted out quickly. Recommend the BBQ Bacon burger
Also, ask about their military discount if it applies to you to save 10%, they don't advertise this but do carry it for Active Duty and I'm pretty sure vets as well.",4
"Great music & and shopping centers close by, the food is awesome, and the hostess Brenda was very friendly!

I would give it 10/10! It it had the option.",5
"Fast friendly service, food cooked to order. No complaints!",4
Daniel did such a great job today ! He was quick and friendly ! And made sure we had all of what we need plus more,5
Always a great burger! The cocktails tasted good too! Wish they were a little stronger though!,4
The food was delicious and our server Daniel was fast and friendly! Would definitely recommend!,5
"We wanted to love this place. The food was good and the service was good, but the location is horrible. We were seated on the patio, Wahlburgers was playing loud music, but 10 feet away there was competing loud music from another business. Picture pounding rap music and super loud country music competing for your attention. Then, on top of that, there were at least four tv screens all playing different things. Walked out of there with a headache.",3
Expected more from this place and was disappointed. Taste was sub par on salad and burger. Sweet potato tots were good. Won’t return.,3
"Food was okay…. Not amazing but what you’d expect. Bartender (middle-aged, blonde woman) was absolutely awful—the worst. Our tab arrived before our drinks or food. Our food arrived way before our drinks. She then brought our drinks and gave an excuse that our drinks were “too hard to make” as we watched her take and make 5 orders after ours. Manager comped the drinks but overall a negative experience.",1
Had a fantastic time here. Staff was very friendly and service was quick. The burger was so big my husband couldn’t finish (even though it was so good he wanted to eat it all). Can’t wait to go again.,5
"Best burgers we’ve had in quite some time. Get the combo fries and onion rings with a cold frosty. Delicious! In fact, we liked this place more than some of the trendier places. Great food/value/atmosphere choice. Loved it.",5
"The food was really good, and the restaraunt looked really nice! They had pictures of everything the family starred in, and there were plenty of puns in the menu. Little pricey, but we got a souvenir cup when we ordered drinks.",5
If you like sloppy burgers and fresh food this is the place to go. Great fast service and friendly servers.,5
Great food. Good service. When I go back to visit in Vegas I'm sure to go back.,5
Burgers were way too small for the price I literally finished in 3 bites but the flavor was good and the straws are too thin for the shakes. Fries were okay. Probably wouldn't recommend unless you can't get seated anywhere the place seems to always have short waiting times so that should tell you something.,3
"Nice location. Staff very nice. Good taste great. Just a little high, but to be expected begin on the strip. Fries, onion rings, and tots separate item. Like the cut out up front of all three brothers. Bar is awesome!",4
"Good food, very nice attention. For a quick quality lunch is good option.",4
Nice place to beat the heat and grab a burger and beer. Reasonably price and good service,5
Great atmosphere!! Visiting from Texas Wahlburgers was everything we expected. Just missing a Donnie pop up. The staff was great,4
All I can say for the money I'd rather go to In- n - out Burger. Much better burger than these dried out things. And all the hypes soviener drinks 14 bucks. Taking free pictures then trying to sell them to you. Hell all I wanted was a good burger. That I never got here. Won't be back!!,1
"Not impressed at all. I should’ve went to Shake Shack. Fries were dry and cold. Asked for new fries & got nuked fries. Got the wrong burger. All they did was slap a patty on & didn’t melt the cheese. No root beer. $50 for a hot mess. My bad, aluke-warm mess. Disappointed in the Wahlburger joint. Not a fan.",1
100% Recommend ! My server Brenda recommended the Double Decker & by far the best burger I had!,5
Stopped in for breakfast. I know not a place you would think of for breakfast but they do have a small breakfast menu. Everything was really good and reasonably priced. Souvenir cups were included with our meal. Super nice waitress and staff! Will be back to try a burger soon! Btw there is someone that takes your picture for free but the prints are not. No big surprise but she did an awesome job! I highly recommend stopping by!,5
"Really good food. Didn’t like that fries had to be bought separately though. Kinda pricey but hey, it’s Vegas. Service was really good.",4
Food was good. Suggest the Mac & Cheese. Server Daniel will take care of your needs.,5
"Absolutely loved it. Had it the first time a month ago while on a business trip. And literally convinced my wife to go back this past weekend to have her try it. Had the OFD first and it was a stunner. That Tomato Jam maybe my new favorite thing to put on a burger. Transformed a regular Mushroom Swiss burger to something so much more. Second time tried the Portabello Sandwich and it didn't disappoint. Yukon Gold Fries are unique potato of choice for frird. But you can't leave without ordering some Macaroni Salad, it was so fresh and delicious.",5
"The burger itself was decent but very oily. I definitely wasn’t a big fan of the bun because it wasn’t very toasted. The shake was the big winner as it was very light and creamy without being too thick and not too sweet. The burger itself cost $12 (double) and the shake came in a semi-reusable cup for $8.

At these prices I’d rather have shake shack or much rather have In-N-Out",3
"Had the best service from Sabrina!
“Mi Gentee”
She’s fantastic.",5
"Got the impossible burger because I had it elsewhere and absolutely loved it. It was simply not good here. I like caramelized onions as much as the next guy but I was swimming in it from how much they put on this burger. Patty was super thin which is weird considering the other place I went to had a thick and meaty one for cheaper.

Fries were below average and service was also below average. I was pretty disappointed.",2
"Ordered a Hamburger with no cheese and a Orange Creamsicle float, to go. My order came to just over 12 bucks. I thought that was not too bad for Vegas. When my order was ready they had forgotten my drink and as it turned out they did not even ring it up. They got me the drink and did not charge me for it. The hamburger was good but I don't know about for $12+ ( including tax). It's definitely better then most fast food chains. I don't remember what the listed price for the Orangsicle drink was but it came in a plastic collector type cup, it was some scoops of vanilla ice cream and a bottle of Fanta orange soda. I thought it would be a little cheaper grabbing lunch outside the Casino but maybe not.",4
Such good food an fast service! Nice people. All around 5 stars. I recommend the our burger😍🤤,5
I got the supermelt. I asked for Walh sauce on the side. It was good without it. I could've done without the fries because they weren't seasoned.,5
"Absolutley wonderful! The wait was not too long for a busy Saturday at lunch time. Service was great and food was wonderful! Everything tasted fresh and felt like it was crafted with care! I wish we had one back home but it was perfect for lunch, filling, and delicious. Overall fairly priced for the high quality of food! I highly recommend the onion rings! They are thinly sliced, crispy and delicious! We shared them as a group along with fries. Yum totally worth the wait, we had 6 people and were seated within an hour. They also send you a text when the table is ready so we were able to walk around a little and sight see before hand.",5
"Really good food, prices reasonable until you add fries and a drink. Two burgers, two ice teas, one order of fries and it turned into 50 bucks, plus ten for parking. I'll save my money and go to 5 Guys, The Habit, or In N Out, thanks.",3
Friendly staff! Drink was made well and my burger only took about five minutes to make. I enjoyed the burger especially the house made pickles and the signature sauce. Finished off with a Orange Cream Float that was fantastic. Would definitely visit again!,5
Delicious food and great service !,5
The burgers where ok only because we where extremely Hungry. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the Food everything from the fries to the drink is all bought separately and for the price of just the  Burger being 15$  was totally not worth it  I totally understand its Las Vegas and I was expecting to pay a high price for a meal but I was expecting also to pay a high price for a good quality meal.  It's sad to say but with such a huge celebrity name behind it you think they would make sure you where 100% Satisfied.😥,1
I'm so sad to say this. Every time we come to Vegas I eat at Wahlburgers and its always so good but this time I was so disappointed. My burger looked like a McDonald's one and my fries looked like they were from the bottom of the bag. So so sad,2
Amazing food and thank you to Daniel for his great service ! Super nice and attentive,5
"Just came back from Wahlburgers. The food and drinks were amazing. But the dessert was the best. The 'Banana FlutterNutter' was the name of this delicious goodness. Banana, nutella, marshmallow, and grilled to perfection.",5
"The supervisor was extremely rude. I am a vegetarian but didn't want to eat the Impossible Burger because it tears up your stomach.. the menu online showed an item but they didn't have it. I asked the server if I could order the grilled cheese and he said no problem.  However, the supervisor came over and told me he couldn't do that and was very rude. He basically tried to shame me for being a vegetarian.  I will NEVER go to any Wahbugers ever.",1
Burgers are okay. The real gems are the sides! Pro-tip: get the salad. You won't regret it!,5
"Very lacking.... The food was not bad, but was not even close to great and the portions were so small. I could have bought a children's burger at McDonald's and got as much or more food then this and saved $15.  The price and the portions do not match for a sit down restaurant.  If you are hungry,  choose something else. Will not be eating here ever again.",1
Food was great...really would be nice if the bar/restaurant had a freakin' restroom..!!!,1
Burger was really good. The fries were also good but the tots were kind of bland. Neat experience to go to a restaurant I've watched the TV show for. Price was high for receiving just $$ on the Google search but to be expected for a celebrity based restaurant.,4
Everything was very tasty and the service was great,5
"Pricey, but great tasting burgers. There's a vegetarian option with The Impossible Burger, but damn, it's expensive. $18 for The Impossible Burger. Regular burgers are only $12-15ish. Onion strings are yummy and crisp. Beer options are ok if you like hoppy beers; if you're a malty beer fan, you deal with the standard Guinness.",4
Definitely enjoyed - friendly staff. Ordered the BBQ bacon burger and a mix of onion rings and fries ... delicious. Also tried out several local IPAs (Joseph James Hop Box and the Atomic Duck),4
Great burger. Egotistical decor,5
Had great meal. Excellent server Daniel.,5
"We went in expecting great burgers, we ordered the BBQ bacon burger & was very disappointed with the size of . I honestly could've gotten a bigger burger at McDonald's for a fraction of the price. We also ordered the Sweet Thai Chili chicken tenders & they had no flavor. Staff was not very friendly & didn't really engage with the customers. Will not be returning, I will go to McDonald's first.",1
Always great food. Loved the orange soda float too!,5
Well they certainly have the right stuff here and while they may be a new kid on the block in Vegas they sure did deliver with amazing food and really great service. The souvenir cup is also a bonus!,5
"place was terrible!! McDonald’s would have been better! I wish I was exaggerating! Came here last night I thought it was going to be as good as the habit I ordered two bacon burgers they tasted like school lunch burgers! It was very bad they added jalapeños to make it seem fancy or sum but it was all around trash and burgers were small 0/10 and got chicken tenders and fries fries are whatever taste like doubles fries chicken tenders were whatever 1/10
The only good thing was the fried pickles but that’s it! I rather save my money and go to McDonald’s!!! yuck !",1
Stopped in to try the burgers and was very pleased. The burgers and fries tasted homemade...perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. I LOVED them. I'll definitely return.,5
Best burgers. Hands down! And service. Thank you Daniel,5
"Verrrrrryyyyyyyy unhappy with the portion,  SERVICE and decore. Service at the door and at the table was non existent and unpleasant.  The burger was cold when brought to the table, and it looked like a happy meal(no toy). It could taste decent if actually served correctly but the toilet smell from around the corner was the final straw.......NEVER AGAIN. TRY RAMSEY'S BURGER JOINT......WAYYYYYYYY BETTER,  NOT EVEN COMPARABLE.",2
"Mark Wahlberg should stick to acting. If you want to eat at Wahlburgers for the delicious craft burgers...... please find an alternative location to spend your hard earn money. This is essentially Jack In the Box for triple the price. The best thing about this establishment is the free water. $45 for two burgers, 1 set of fries, 1 side of Mac and cheese. No soda. FYI soda is $5 dollarydoos",1
The chicken sandwich needs to be taking off the menu... NASTY! And the ranch is not good,1
"I enjoyed it here. Personally I felt that the prices was pretty high, but your in Vegas. What do you expect. The burgers did have good spice and flavors to them and it was crowded but it has its calming points.",4
"Unreal! Best mushroom cheese burger ever.
Great service! We were seated immediately on a Saturday night and out food was on our table in about 10 minutes.
This is my new favorite place!
Thanks all, you did great !",5
"Friendly staff and the food was good. You can get ""government cheese"" on your hamburger which is awesome and unique. The Wahl sauce is pretty much just thousand island sauce thats not chunky. The fries were soft so if you don't like mushy fries I wouldn't suggest getting them.",3
I was rather impressed with the quality and speed of the service. My server was Daniel and I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience.,5
"Seated right away but took lomg time to get food.  Burgers small for the price. The size of a McDonald's double cheeseburger for 10 times the price.
One worker came around and took pictures of us. She gave us 1 free then came back and tried to sell 1 pic for $20, 2 for $30 and so on.  When we declined, she told us they were going to be thrown away in trash or we could give her $10 for all of them.  WHAT?!  They were just like 50 bucks now $10 or the trash.  No thank you.
Food was decent but 1 time experience for us.",3
"Went here because I love the family but wow totally disappointed. We were a large group so we order almost everything on the menu but honestly nothing tasted good. The burgers had an after taste, I can't describe. The fried pickles were stale and old. The chilli almost Iike Wendy's chilli, but Wendy's actually tasted better. Everything was over priced and the tables were sticky. The only thing that was good was the service. The one star was for their good service. Other than that I would never go back.",1
"Portabella sandwich DELISH!
Waitress found me a table inside as the outdoor area did not smell good.",5
"The one thing I was most looking forward to about going to Vegas this time was eating at Wahlburgers.  We had to wait a bit, but once seated the service was great.  I had The Super Melt.  It was without a doubt, the greatest patty melt I've ever eaten.  It was incredible.  Wish I had remembered to snap a picture.",5
Food was great once again! This was my second time going to this location and it did not disappoint. Staff was friendly and we were seated right away. Will definitely be back on my next trip to Vegas!,5
"Las Vegas in Summer is hot!  Waiting time to get inside where is cool is 15minutes.  We were setting outside but all the missters were out(not working), we ask for a cold beer and it was not cold at all. Pic of misters working across from us working.",1
Fried pickles were rather flavorless.  Burger was just OK.  Bun was rather plain.  Basin was done well.,2
"You can get better burgers in any direction, why choose here.

While the burger had good taste, the fries weren’t very good, and it definitely wasn’t worth the $22 price tag!

For some reason it took 26 minutes to get a “to go” order.",3
Food is great reasonably priced but being harassed by photographer while trying to eat and spend time with family. Not a good experience.,2
"Got seated right away but then waited over 20 minutes to get acknowledged by any staff. Our table was uneven and sticky. Once we got our food it was less then impressive. Don't come here, you pay for the name. Awful experience, Vegas had much more to offer.",1
"Short wait, good food, Wahl sauce is awesome and so are the buns. Not what I expected after watching several seasons. Looks alot different than on tv, more of a small diner. Everyone was friendly, working at a very urgent pace and the food was good. I didn't like being told I could get a complimentary photo postcard for free and then get harrassed about buying pictures. I told the girl no 3 times. She walked away like she read mad but it was annoying. But I still love the Walburgers.",5
"We have been watching the show forever and have always wanted to try it, fast friendly service and the food was great. 4 people 4 burgers 1 fry and 3 drinks $80 total.",5
"This place is pretty good but I feel like there are better places for the money. A burger, fries and a alcoholic drink, set me back like $30 dollars. There are better and cheaper places close by.",4
The food was incredible and Daniel provided exemplary service!,5
"Burger reminded me of something I could get at Wendy's for 1/3 of the price... Service was pretty terrible as well... Our order came out incomplete (someone didn't get their burger) and it took 20min to flag someone down while sitting at the mostly empty bar... to let them know and then got the 3rd degree - had to tell at least three people the same story to confirm the missing burger, before it finally came out... Would not recommend.",1
"I’m sitting here right now and I’m amazed at the service, to be frank, ITS TRASH. Im sitting here sweating trying to eat my food because it’s super hot, they have the doors wide open and my waitress keeps missing in action. They have some one going around and taking pictures of people sitting down eating and for some odd reason my wife and I are being overlooked.  I think I know why! All the people who was offered photos was white as snow. Maybe if I was white I could have taken a picture in mark wahlbergs restaurant but I guess being black doesn’t permit that action. Over all the food lacked flavor and the Mac and cheese should be called flavorless town Mac n cheese. Would not recommend this place to people of my culture. PLUS ITS HOOTTTTT",1
"Great burgers, great fries, and great service.
Dianna was AWESOME!!!",5
Chili was like dog food and had no flavor. Got two of us sick.,1
Just a fun place to eat have to try the spike  ice tea NOT FOR KID.. 😆.. Bbut it isa family fun place for burger.,5
This is a very nice spot to eat at with reasonable pricing!...........Saturnsgadgets.com,4
Very  very reasonable prices. Outstanding hamburgers and the atmosphere is fun and family friendly.,5
Good tasting home style burgers. Best in the USA.,5
"I've been ""over"" the In and Out, MacDonalds, White Castle, etc argument. If you need to custom order at a Burger Place to get a decent sized burger, that's not a Burger Place. I couldn't have been more pleased and the size, quality and presentation of the food and the location. Give em all the stars. Top notch burger place and I'll be back every time I'm in Vegas.",5
"This was my first time at Wahlburgers in Las Vegas. I ate an Our Burger and it was really good. The ingredients were fresh, the restaurant was clean and the staff were nice.",4
"I love this place.  The staff is ALWAYS sweet. The onion rings are 🔥.  It's cheap too, especially for the strip. And the fuel bar right next to it always has BOGO drinks.  Win win💯💪",5
First off the service here is fantastic. You won’t find better. Had the regular cheeseburger and it is very good but the ratio is off between burger and toppings. The cheeseburger was lost in the lettuce tomato onion pickles. Fries and onion rings are above average and they will split an order so you can have both. Definitely worth trying but shake shack is better. Sorry boys.,4
"Food great but customer service worset i.have ever seen. Seen bartender 3 times in 30.kknute wait. For.order, food and bill. Save money and try other places. Than female bartender had a pocket knife. Why at work ? Seems like a problem.huh",2
"Good food, and our server Daniel was very sweet, quick and efficient!",5
"Wahlburgers...what can i say ? It has been a small dream of mine ..ok a BIG dream of mine to eat there and so when we arrived in Vegas on Monday April 22nd 2019 I knew the following day for lunch it was going to be Wahlburgers. It was going to be even more special because my Grandaughter had given me a gift card for my birthday ( April 22nd ) so that ' she could pay for Nana's lunch '. My husband and I both ordered Paul's favorite burger , Hubby had fries ..I had the onion rings . He also ordered ice water and I ordered a strawberry Margarita. We sat outside at the bar as the day was gorgeous and there was an awesome breeze ...everything was feeling great , for a fantastic lunch...hm not so much. The bartender took our order and then seemed more interested in chatting with 2 women further along the bar (than making sure our food was ready and making our drinks . Ok so , this other couple sits next to us after we had placed our order , gives their order to the other person working the bar and lo and behold gets their food before us . When we finally get our food the burgers were cold !! Hubby said to me "" well at least you got to eat at Wahlburgers ""!!!
The Margarita arrives and was so strong i could barely tell it was strawberry ...thankGod it was pinkish red color or i wouldn't have known....I can't drink it , so cold lunch and no drink...the only thing going for this place is the onion rings - they are totally amazeballs !!!!   Anyway we did complain and the bartender took off the price for the margarita, which was appreciated. All in all it's a nice place ...the energy is good ...you can feel that the family have put their hearts into their business...i just think the staff might need some more training or at least some revised training.",4
"Loved it... that is one hell of a burger and trust me... get a milkshake with it, you can thank me later!",5
Waitress was great. Nice atmosphere. Food was overpriced for what you get.  I was not overly impressed.,3
"This place was an expectedly good deal and a nice pit stop on the strip. The food was delicious and the server was great. It wasn't terribly busy, so we basically walked right in and got seated.",5
Heard or In N Out?  Way better!  This place looks like a hole in the wall with over priced food.  The Our Burger was okay and VERY SMALL!!!!  Would NOT recommend!,1
Food was good. Bar service was sub par. We as a group of 5 sat at bar and we're acknowledged and then ignored for about 15 minutes. No small talk and no smiles. Seemed like we were a nusiance to be there. The others enjoyed the burgers. As a customer I want to be treated well. Maybe it is Vegas?,2
"Wahlburgers has a super convenient walk up window with affordable drink specials. It's close to everything, and since you can walk and drink, we frequented it a few times. Beer specials 2 cans for $5. Mixed drink $5. Frozen drinks. And each time the server was very friendly and efficient.",5
"Good selection of burgers and sandwiches.  Had the BBQ bacon, delicious!  The moonshine tea is a must.  The service is fast but not really friendly.",4
Really good burgers and service!,5
Wahlburgers is the place to get a great burger.  Service is fast and I am into less is more when getting the best taste.  Less fluff and more tasty meat.  Worth a visit or two.,5
Great burgers Great customer service Great atmosphere loved it!,5
"The Impossible plant-based Burger is my fave. I always get that, the lemonade and thin, crispy onion rings...with extra Wahl sauce. I take the crispy onion rings, and extra Wahl sauce, and put them on the burger. Oh. My. Gawd!
Like potato chips on a hoagie. #Phillygirl
I used to go to the one in Atlantic City. So glad there's finally one out here.
Sidebar: I'd suggest they put one on Freemont Street 😉
#go",3
"We arrived in non-peak hours and we're seated immediately.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  Burgers were medium sized and about $13 but that doesn't come with a side (fries are about $5). One in our small group had Cobb salad with a special request to omit a couple ingredients, and that request was easily accommodated.  Overall we were quite happy with the place.  Not a place you'll want to sit and chat for a couple hours, but more comfy and inviting than McDonald's. I wouldn't call it a 'you've got to eat here' place, but it was good and with great service.",4
Really good food The Onion rings are more like onion strings so be ready.,5
"Burgers are so dam good here, average price for the las vegas strip. ""Say hi to your mom for me""",5
"Very average. Expected better for Mark Wahlberg putting his name on it. Not bad, although the sides weren’t great. Just super mediocre.",2
Burgers were not as big as expected.  They were good but not great.  Waiter was good.  No wait.  Photographer lady was annoying and didn't know when to leave us alone.,3
Super melt was delicious. It actually melted in my mouth as I bit into it. Highly recommended.,5
"Maybe I had too high of expectations on this place, but I was very unimpressed and I really wanted to like it!  I get that most places charge ""strip prices"" but when people pay that much generally they expect a good meal in return. The price wasn't justified on anything we had, Burger, fries, cocktails, and even a salad. Next time I'll just make reservations at Gordon Ramsey Burger and spend a little more money.",2
"I have to agree with some other posters on here on that I was disappointed with my experience there. When you pay 60 dollars with tip for two people at basically a fast food joint, I expect more",3
"It's a ""whole in the wall"" style burger without the whole in the wall. It's a face paced burger place so even with it being an sit down you can get in and out fast. I feel it's a greasy burger but that could be the sauce too, but to me that's the hallmark of an good burger. But never had indigestion because of it. I highly recommend the burgers, I didnt have the fries or tots.",5
If you're looking for delicious food wahlburgers is the place. Of course I wanted to go because I'm a new kids fan best decision I made. A must go to stop on the Vegas strip.,5
"We did not get burgers, but the food was good.  Our server, Daniel, was fast and friendly.",4
I’m a fan of Mark Wahlberg but I can’t say I’m a fan of his burger and paying $25.31. But I got to keep my glass as souvenir. Thanks Mark,3
Good food.  Friendly staff. Great beer,5
The food at wahlburgers is always great!,5
These burgers are AWESOME! These fries are Amazing! Say yes and eat here.,5
Loved this place. Come to this restaurant everything we are in Vegas.,4
"Great burger and great service ,also great mule cocktails,,but a bit pricey",4
"The fries were overcooked hard
The burger meat was not thick and juicy. Not tasty but love the family. I went to the one in Boston 10 times better .",4
Burgers are great and the chili bacon fries were amazing,5
They stated there iPads were down and refused to take name/number to get in. Bad management ability. If you have more then two people don’t recommend.,1
Ramsey burger 10x better ! This place is not what it used to be. The bun is so small and the fries came out 10 min after my burger 🙄,1
"Wahlburgers is a great hamburger joint with a very interesting history. Good friendly atmosphere and service. Delicious hamburgers fries and much more. I’m surprised you don’t need a reservation at a place this good. Interesting note, if they are busy they will take your name and number and text you when you’re order is ready",5
My fries came out cold. My burger was super tasty.  This is not even the reason for the 3 stars.  We were seated upstairs and the guy who was at the front area was super unprofessional.  On his phone sitting on the back desk area twirling dice. Not even pretending to be busy. Not only that he sat multiple people without wiping down menus or tables. It was crazy to watch.,3
Good overall. Had the Thanksgiving Burger which was good but not wow.  The sweet potato tots and onions were good.  Overall not bad for a snack or smaller meal and nice servers but would be a disappointment for a major meal.,4
Gatta go when youre on the strip,5
"Loved the space. The service was great and fast for the middle of the afternoon.  I had ""marks"" choice the Thanksgiving Burger. It was delicious.",5
Great atmosphere! Awesome burgers and Vanessa was very friendly! Viva Las Vegas!!,5
Best burger I've had in a long time! Great environment and service.,5
"Dam good burger! Onion rings on POINT!

Mac & Cheese was great. Creamy, cheese and properly the best, besides my wife's....

I got the double, lots of beef. I'll settle for a single next! Fries, Yukon Potatoes! Dam good. Tots were great too!

I did take out, but next time will try and experience the restaurant atmosphere.",5
The food was great. The website said it is first come first serve but we found out with covid they are only taking reservations. So we had to make one for the following day and return. The food was good so in the end we were happy!,5
"Seriously the best burger I've ever eaten. 😍
Absolutely Recommend.",5
Killer fiesta burger and fries.  Great service and location,5
Love the burgers.  I usually order the crispy chicken sandwich.  It is amazing.,5
"You know when you find a good burger spot when you finish the whole burger LOL . I came here with my mom and two sons , and we had a blast. The food was great and the drinks were strong . This is definitely a must come .",5
Love trying these places when I travel. Good service and good food.,5
"Decent service(five star), $30 for two burgers slightly bigger than a Big Mac with a 25 minute wait. Dry/burnt burger was sad because I was honestly excited to eat there. Only worth it if you want to say you’ve eaten there.",5
"I wanted to try the infamous Wahlburgers, needless to say, I’m extremely disappointed. The burger was sloppy, the burger itself was 2x smaller than the bun and the taste was meh.",3
Great burgers!! I have been addicted to salad burgers ever since eating there! I can’t wait to go back and try the burgers. Clean and great prices.,5
"The bun, patties, and sauce are amazing. The chicken tenders are great too!",5
Can make better sloppy joes with McCormick store bought seasoning amd adding a touch of bbq sauce. Theses arent that great.,3
"Food was reasonably priced, good, and great service.  Good location off the strip too.",5
In Las Vegas I want with my family and Tyler was the best waiter in the world if you don't have wahlburgers in your state go there it was so good,5
"Good food, quick service, a bit pricey.",4
"Big fan! Marky Mark can do no wrong it seems. Tried the Impossible Burger which was great, and the Sweet Potato Tots are winners!!! Great service and vibe. Will go back whenever I find one.",5
"Friendly people and great food. It's just like in the tv show. A must see, but it does get crowded.",5
Thought it was going to be more gimmick than substance but was pleasantly surprised to get a really tasty burger and cocktails! Will definitely be coming back for more!,5
Customer service is lacking! Food wasn’t that good at all. Chili had only a few beans and had huge chunks of beef patties in it.,1
The burger was really good and juicy the pickles were the star of the burger! The frys were dry and lacked any flavor,3
"Had the Mac n cheese. Reallllly not impressed. No flavour, served in a cereal bowl.

The impossible vegan burger was bland. So pricey for so little.

Service was great, just the food flavour isn't there. It's more of a novelty spot.

You do get to keep the softdrink cup... But at 4.95 for a coke, I sure hope I can keep the cup hehe",1
"We were there over the Valentine Holiday.  It didn't appear to be as nice as the show, in fact it was really worn down and dirty.  We sat at the Bar which wasn't any better and had drinks and a burger.  The music was changed to Screaming Rock where you can't hear any words just Screaming.  After 3 songs my head started to hurt and asked the Bartender why the change in Music?  She asked her manager and that is what he preferred.   We didn't even finish our drinks or Food, paid and left.  For us, we won't be back, the cost was over $52 for us to learn a hard lesson.  If it doesn't look worth it, RUN....because it won't be.",2
"Great burgers and beer selection. Pleasant atmosphere and was able to get a pic with Maki-Mak...cardboard cut out works for me lol
*update: blue moon mango AMAZING",5
So freaking good. If you're here and they don't have a Wahlburger near you then you have to do it! So good only thing is the fifty different things resembling Mark Wahlberg lol,5
"Convenient location makes $14 chicken sandwich with no side almost worth cost.  Also, funny the way they promote government grade cheese.  Mac and Cheese was tasteless.",2
This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit while in Vegas. Service has always been amazing. Short wait times and speedy service.,5
classic cheeseburger and tots.  good,5
Loved it!!!.. such tasty burgers and friendly staff...,5
Awsome every body so nice,5
Best Burger I've had in awhile Onion Rings are crazy  delicious... Food came fast and if you come before 12 you get seated fast.,5
Great Burgers and Service,5
"Food was delicious, affordable prices and our waiter was friendly. Next time I'm in Las Vegas I'll be going back to Wahlburgers!",5
I can go to McDonald's for the same burger for $5 less.  Not impressed.  I was very disappointed from what I was told about the food here,3
"Great late night food, burger was excellent, the location is at the back of the bazar, in the front is just the giftshop bar",4
Amazing Food. Great Atmosphere.,5
"Bad.  Really bad and extremely disappointing.  I visited this restaurant several years ago and it was pretty good at that time.   Wahlburgers has been made famous by the TV show by the same name.  Not sure what has happened, but food quality was extremely poor.  The burger they brought out was on a bun that was 20% smaller then the meat.  Fries that cost over $4 were about the size of a McDonald's small fries... Come to think of it, McDonald's fries are better.  Service was great which is why this is 2 stars instead of 1.  Will NOT be back.",2
I purchased the Impossible Burger. It was a little pricey but had the best flavor. Definitely worth the price.,5
"My husband and I were on a layover in Vegas and decided to stop at Wahlburgers for lunch. We were served by Amber, who was absolutely awesome. She was very nice and very attentive to our needs. We ordered a beer and a pina colada. My pina colada was great, but a little heavy on the alcohol and couldn't taste much of the other flavors. The burgers were to die for. Some of the best burgers we have ever ate. The sides (fries and tater tots) were really crispy. They let you take the glasses home at the end. I really loved this place all around, and the service just put everything over the top. I cant wait till one comes to Chicago!",5
"The place was pretty full when we arrived, and it took a while to place our order. The food did come quickly, though, and service was good. The food quality and portion sizes were impressive, but still a little pricey (although not bad for the strip).",4
The burgers ar amazing. Been there many times haven't had one i didn't like.,5
I got the BBQ Bacon burger with an order of half onion strings half fries and a Hurricane drink. It was DELICIOUS! Fast service too. My friend got a regular bacon cheeseburger and tater tots with a Pepsi and a Hurricane drink. Our bill totaled $74. Our drinks were $14 each and Pepsi was $4.95.  As a side note: Best Bun Everrrr!,4
"The staff is friendly and being as efficient as they can be under the current COVID environment.  The food, on the other hand, is overprice. We ordered the Impossible Burger.  The sauce is not spicy as the menu stated and the patty is a bit dry.  It is still a good burger, but not worth the $20 asking price.",3
"Hands down, THE BEST place to eat, EVER! The environment was lively, I loved everything about it! People and staff were super friendly and service was quick and easy! I'm from Arizona and I would not mind coming to their locations in California and Las Vegas just for a bite to eat! 😁😍 I finally found the best burger joint with the most delicious burgers in town!",5
"Love the drinks, good service and they have the best deals on the strip. I had something it was only 5 bucks it just has better than the $20",5
"This place was perfect for a good burger that wasn't too expensive. We got right in and it didn't take too long for us to get our food either. Nice relaxed vibe, great staff, and great experience!",5
On vacation and decided to try this place. Let me say this place has great alcohol and shakes. The BBQ burger I got had 1 small slice of bacon and the jalpeno peppers were so spicy I couldnt taste the cheese or bacon. The fries were sub par. The actual hamburger was great meat was right. But they messed up my order by messing up burger and not getting a drink I had paid 8 dollars for and as soon as i got to my hotel room and noticed the issue. I  called and got put on hold 3 times.,1
Very delicious burger. I would recommend this to anybody who wants to try it.,5
Excellent food. Can have alcoholic drinks with your burget,5
"The burgers were great. Awesome flavor.  Got the bbq bacon burger, sweet potato tots which I never had(delicious), the our burger and the Turkey burger.. enjoyed them all.  Only thing I thought was that the price was high for the size of the burger but that could be cause it is on the strip. Our waiter wasn't that nice. Didn't come back to ask for refills or how we were doing. The other waitress and waitress took care of us just not ours. Will be back when in Vegas",4
The burger was pretty tasty. I got the BBQ Burger. The prices are as expected in Vegas. Would recommend if you don't mind the tab.,4
Great burger. Worth the trip to check out for sure.,4
"I'll start out by telling you that I had a Ratatouille moment, I ordered the Turkey burger. Upon biting on it, I was taken back to my younger days after Thanksgiving. When we would make those sandwiches. My wife had the bacon burger salad, she also loved it. Will continue to come here every chance I get, I hope to see y'all there.",5
Great place got to support the Wahlbergs great people good food upbeat fun place really good drinks enjoyed the experience the special sauce is bomb and you gotta try Donnie's burger 👍🤯,4
"I decided to read the last year of reviews before posting one.  This is my first time here.  I am dining alone for lunch and was going to try the bar seating, but it felt uncomfortable.  I switched to a booth and it was much better.  The place looks like it as originally built for walk up service with a bar (see the photo), but it is table service. The menu has plenty to choose from.  The waitress was super friendly.. maybe borderline too friendly.. saying.. ""how is it going love"", ""hey babe"", etc. I guess when your a cute young gal, you can get away with that in Las Vegas.  She may get better tips with the vocabulary.... Who knows.  I got an Our Burger ""as-is"" and one side of a combo onion straws/fries.  As others have indicated the burger was probably a little smaller than I would have expected. The burger was fresh and the ingredients were good. They should have more of their sauce on the table.  The side was good and the combo was an idea from the waitress.  The iced tea was fresh and I had good table service.  Now let's talk money.. The basic meal (see the photo) was $22.57 for one.  The $4.95 drink was the expensive part.  I did not ask for a souvenir cup, but I got one.  I am also sure the rent on the strip is not cheap and that may be part of the higher cost.   They get four stars for slightly high prices and a very good.. not exceptional burger.  Ultimately, would I recommended the place.. Yes (based on past reviews, I would avoid busy times).",4
"Sat down expecting to have a good meal. Waited for over and hour and a half on a Tuesday night just to get served. Literally watched over 40 orders get filled. Brought me my order incomplete. Like wow Markie Mark, for my first time sitting down at one of your restaurants your employees really dropped the ball.",1
"Good burgers & very accomendating staff with good looking ladies! they got a bachelor party of 10 of us in pretty quicky. Food is a little on the pricey side but most restaurants in Vegas are, but it read worth it.",5
It felt like any other burger joint. I was not impressed. I would go back because it was good. I can think of a few places that add better. The prices are good and worth stopping.,3
Pretty good burger. Onion strings are tasty there ranch has a twang to it ( not bad),4
Fu king delicious,3
"Don’t believe the hype. It’s just an average burger. You will find a better burger from In & Out or The Habit.
Nothing too impressive. The only thing I liked was our server. She was delightful and moved to Vegas to attend school.

Don’t waste your money on it. I only did because of the curiosity of Wahlberg.",3
"Not a great burger, but the BBQ bacon cheese was a good one. Solid patty - I added lettuce and tomato to it and had to get extra bbq sauce.

The sweet potato tots are way too sweet. You can hold the sugar boys!

A good place to grab a bite after midnight as they're open till 2!",4
"Good basic burger and fun environment, you’re just paying a little more than the typical Vegas surcharge for the name.",3
"My husband and I went to Vegas on a whim. We were walking around when we saw their restaurant and decided we were going there to eat. The burgers are mouth watering. But what really amazed us was their onion rings. Holy moly were they undeniably wonderful!! Then we had both of their new cocktails and I was sold!! Hands down my favorite place to eat!
Paul, keep up the great work. You and your family have helped inspire my husband to get more in depth with cooking since he has retired from the military. He struggled with brain injuries from his deployments and other injuries he has from doing his job during his 27 years of Active Duty. He turned to cooking and trying new recipes, and now he wants to try to match your onion rings. So, thank you from the bottom of my heart.",5
"Portobello sandwich was disappointing and too small for the price. Fries were great.  I know that this may not be their best item on the menu, but this was the only vegetarian option (other than the impossible burger).",2
Amazing as always!!! Bartenders were flipping amazing.,5
First time ever at wahlburgers...Waited about 10-15 minutes to get burger and fries... I got horrible service from these guys...It definitely looked like they were busy having fun than serving customers with 4 guys on the grill and 2 in front passing food...The guy behind me got his food before I did...that's pretty messed up...My to go order bag didn't get any napkins or sauce for fries. .For the price $17.21 I paid for the burger and fries..I will be going to a better burger place....Burger bottom bun was stale and lettuce was all over the place... The fries were a little under cooked..I will not be coming back to this place. And I would not recommend this place to eat.....I sure do hope Mark corrects these issues...First impression always is the key to getting customers to come back to eat.,1
"Food was good. But I don’t get what all the hype was about? It was very expensive for what it was.
There are better value places to eat on the strip for burgers. Chips serving size was small and not usual standard.",3
The spinach and artichoke bites as an app were awesome I highly recommend them! Service was good and staff was friendly!!,5
The burgers 🍔 were great. The service was impeccable.,5
"Expensive, 28$ for a burger fries and a coke... however it’s good and fast, they respect how cooked you want it",4
To long to get food. 30 mins. And nothing special.,1
"We are in Las Vegas for our birthdays.  We went to Wahlbergers for the first time, even though they have one a couple hours away from us in St. Charles.

The food was absolutely amazing!  Our group ordered  2 supermelts,  BBQ Bacon Burger, The Our Burger.  Every burger was delicious!  Best burgers we have ever had.  Onion rings, sweet potato tots, and fries were all great!  Drinks definitely hit the spot!

Our waiter, John is great- friendly, attentive, and went out of his way to make us feel welcomed and have fun!

We are already talking about driving 2 hours to the St. Charles location when we get home.",5
"We love this place and was our only planned destination. Our medium burgers where rare, rare, rare. Neither of us finished them. So disappointing. Service was good.",4
Great service great burger just the right size ..after eating we weren't too full we was just right .. and that's what u want in Vegas or anywhere actually lol energized up not tired with a bunch of carbs.. perfect 👍💪👌,5
Best Burgers ever hands down and I been all around the world and these were the best,5
"The biggest that I love about this place is yes they make incredible gourmet level burgers yet they present it in a accessible manner. They could have easily served this burger on a white porcelain plate with 10x10 linen napkins but they stayed true to their roots. And that's a regular everyday hard working Bostonion. The high end burgers are served on wax paper in baskets, the fries are served in disposable containers and the drinks aren't served in glass ware, it's served in disposable cups with a cap and straw. Love it. The staff was very attentive and kept it real. 5 stars",5
Great food and outstanding staff that will take care of you.,5
"Waste of money. The burgers are tiny, the side salad was drenched in dressing. Fries bland, burgers bland. Not impressed at all",1
"Great, wish we had one on the east coast",5
"I had their Thanksgiving Turkey Burger and it was delicious. Perfect flavor and seasoning. I would come back for sure. The “complimentary” photos were a little annoying, but I did like their souvenir soda cups. Reasonable prices & definitely worth it.",5
Impossible Burger is worth it to try! It's definitely amazingly good. I can't believe it's not meat (technically) 😂,5
This place was good! I had the portabella mushroom burger and it was really good! My husband had the double decker burger and he loved it. The fries were good also. The server was very nice. We would go back!,5
"I can't believe this restaurant doesn't have any Tabasco Sauce. I asked for hot Sauce, and they don't have it. My bill was over $60 bucks. Really you can't supply that?",1
Good burgers! The onion rings are delicious! Quick service from waiter. It is a bit pricy though.,4
"Quality of meat was great but cheeseburger lacked any seasoning or flavor at all. Salt, people! Wahlburger sauce was bland. Fries just okay. Suggest you skip and head over to tried and true burger places.... you know the ones! ;)",2
"Better than 4. Not a 5. Double decker burger which  supposedly included salsa and chipotle mayo (I asked off, some was atill put on) was bland anyway. Grilled perfectly however at medium. Better than Fatburger by wide margin. Fries were super.",5
Yummy! Nice atmosphere! I have been wanting to try it. Wasn't disappointed.,4
The food was good but not the service.  We had jalapenos in the burger when we asked for them to be 86'd and couldn't get drink refills to save our life.  Oh also why did we get green souvenir cups when we didn't ask for them and others for regular paper cups? Feeling suckered......Thanks,1
"Tasty burgers. Drinks are a bit pricey, but you do get to bring home the cup",4
Always wanted to try this place and finally had the opportunity.  The Sloppy Joe was delicious and the burger was great. The staffed was friendly and my Togo order was ready promptly. I'm hoping I have time to eat here again soon.,5
Wonderful food and fast service,5
"I had a beacon cheese burger and onion rings. I have to say The Onion rings were great and the Burger was filling.
Nice to see that some things are still simple. The whole meal was really great and our server was outstanding. He knew the food and the Wahlburgers family story behind it. I will be returning when I'm in Vegas again. Please open one in Chicago!!",5
"Decent burgers, a little overpriced. Nothing too special.",4
"So visited this establishment in Aug of 2018. Really enjoyed the food and the staff was friendly. Came back in 2020. We have a family of five. My wife and I  a 16, 12, and a 6 yo. They seriously tried to seat half of my family across the restaurant. When they said we would be split up I thought that they had sense enough to put my family in booths near each other. But no, so we did not eat there again. Wow! I get people are trying to obey mandates but who would feel comfortable being separated across the room from your kids? I thought that this was a family restaurant who in there right minds feels ok with being separated across the room in Las Vegas?",1
"Great service, food arrived very quickly. The burger was good... I got the double with fries, but it didn't knock my socks off. I also got a coffee milkshake and it was so-so. I'd honestly still go for a double from In-N-Out over here.",4
"Tasty and fresh. Had the
Sausage breakfast sandwich with tots. Very good and filling.",5
I'm sad to say this but the fries were soggy and luke-warm with no salt. The Our burger was not seasoned. Was excited to try but it was a let down unfortunately.,1
"Wonderful service, great food!! Highly recommend the Mud Pie!!!",5
"Starting off by saying that this place is definitely worth a visit for the experience and the food! The burger I had was very juicy and tasty, and the service was friendly and efficient. Only reason why I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because the fries come at a separate charge and are not included with the burger. Also the overall prices are a little steep, but so are a lot of things in Vegas.",4
"The waiter was very friendly and helpful. The only reason they lost a start is the burger had no flavor. I had the O.F.D. and it was cooked to perfection but it was bland. Even the sauteed mushrooms lacked flavor. No I don't have the rona, I'm vaccinated. The sweet potato tots were amazing though!",4
"Was a great stop for lunch while traveling on the trip and visiting Bally's nearby. Our table of 4 all enjoyed their orders, which included different burgers, sandwiches and sides dishes.  Oh yeah, the beer was cold & the mixed drinks were excellent in presentation and taste!  Great service and attention to details.",5
"The hamburgers are fabulous, the service is great, and the drinks are delicious.",5
Awesome food and then a guy picked up our tab. Thank you!,5
This place hands down best burger joint!  If you haven't tried the onion rings.....you're missing out!  They are life changing!  Perfect customer service also!!!,5
Burgers are way too small for the price. If they came from nothing growing up how do you charge $13 for a cheeseburger? And Fries do not come with it.,2
Food is absolutely delicious! The peach half and half tea was amazing!!🍹,5
"I've been hearing about this place for a long time and been wanting to try it ever since I heard about it back home. Let me tell you, this place has probably the best burger I have ever had(and I eat alot of burgers!). If your a burger lover you will enjoy this place. You have to try ""the beast burger"" with the onion rings.",5
"Maybe I set to high of expectations, I was so excited to eat here. To start the orders we placed came out wrong, they did not correctly fix them. Instead they wiped things off and gave me the exact same incorrectly made burger. Two burgers were undercooked and the service alone was terrible. Even with the same server- tables were not offered the same things nor treated the same. Wouldn’t recommend, no better than any burger restaurant in your home town",1
"The food was underwhelming and the service sucked.
Before we even ordered we had a souvenir photo taken (weird at a burger joint if you ask me), and sure enough ended up in a sales pitch later where the girl roller her eyes when we said no.
The waitress who took our order asked what sides we would like as if they came with the meal, so not thinking we chose them, only to find $5 tacked on to the bill for each. And one never even came out of the kitchen! Take that off the cheque.
The burger meat was great, but the rest of the toppings made it not better than we could make at home, and the gluten free bun was an absolute failure. Literally fell apart. Hot dogs weren't cooked through and same store-bought toppings. Fries came out cold.
The waiter who cleared our food and tried to upsell us on dessert obviously didn't take the hint and still took a solid five minutes to return with the bill and then left with my credit card for so long (including taking it into the kitchen) that I had to call my card company for a fraud warning. Sketchy.
Maybe we just caught them on a bad day because the other reviews are pretty good, but we won't be going back unless it's the flagship location that's under the family's supervision.",1
"It was alright. My burger was good...got some bacon avocado type of burger. However, burgers come with no sides. So if you want fries, tots, or onion rings (which are not onion rings, they are onion straws) and each of those sides will start you at $5. So for 3 burgers, 3 sides, 3 drinks...bill was $70. Yowza! To me, that's crazy for burgers but you're paying to eat on the strip.",3
Amazing we go Everytime we r in town great service and amazing food and drinks it's a must to go visit,5
Food was amazing. Well priced for what you recurved. Service was great. I recommend the milkshakes :-),5
"Anyone for tennis? One of Betjeman’s best-loved poems, this is the ‘Miss J. Hunter Dunn’ one (its opening line is more famous than its actual title). Published in 1945, ‘A Subaltern’s Love Song’ is a love song of a peculiarly English kind. The Joan Hunter Dunn who inspired the poem was a real person, who died in 2008 – Betjeman met her during wartime in 1940 and was struck by her, and wrote ‘A Subaltern’s Love Song’ about what it might be like for the two of them to play tennis, fall in love, and get engaged (Betjeman was a married man when he wrote the poem, and the relationship with Miss J. Hunter Dunn remained a fantasy rather than a reality)",5
Great atmosphere. Tasty food and drinks.,5
"05/20/21: Waitress was horrible,  service was horrible,  some of the food my people  ordered was cold. The waitress spilled something from the plates on one of my guest.  Not to mention I had a party of 9, and was informed up front an 18% tip would be added to my bill automatically. We were ok with the tip as long as we received good service. Well we didn't get good service and when I questioned it the waitress argued back with me and I had to explain to her we didn't get a  refill unless we asked for it. We had to ask for silverware,  the waitress was not attentive and kept forgetting things we asked for. I am here on vacation from Indianapolis and we just got a Wahlburger. Needless to say the bad service I received here in Vegas has made me not want to ever go to the Wahlburgers that just opened in Carmel,  IN. I did go to Dennys this morning and had excellent service I took the 18% I was supposed to pay for awful service and paid it and then some to the Dennys waitress",1
Good food. Didn't like that the burgers were kind of small and didn't include fries in the price but the food was good,5
Burgers were okay. I prefer shake shack.,3
"We had an amazing dinner experience!!!! Service, Food Quality were Awesome!!!!",5
"Everything cooked perfect!  Second day in Vegas, and this was the best food so far!",5
Delicious 😋,5
Staff refused to let us in because were asians!  No wonder most of your restaurants are shutting down you treat people badly,1
"The tall lady at the bar was extremely unprofessional inserting herself in a conversation that was not hers! Exactly why she almost got pulled across the very bar she works at every night.

It took an hour to get any sort of customer service after we ordered our food, and in the end we didn’t get our right order. The burger’s bun was burned! Unprofessional and unsatisfactory.",1
Great food. Great service. The food was amazing and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Will definitely come back again when we come back to vegas.,5
I went here because I am a fan of the TV show. I had low expectations for the food going  In  But was pleasantly surprised.  The burgers where perfectly cooked and were juicy. You can get the Wahlburger sauce for dipping your fries in.   The staff was extremely Attentive and nice.,5
Finally found Wahlburgers patties at a grocery store. Been looking for months. They were everything I thought they would be. The beef mixture is the key. Wish they had a location in Lake Havasu City I could use my culinary background for. Vegas location is awesome as well. Love how the organization is run!,5
Got the wahlburger bowl with bacon and an extra patty. Pretty satisfying.,4
"Overall pretty good the bbq bacon burger was awesome and the hurricane cocktail came recommended, plus you can keep the cup and a souvenir. But I'd stay away from the onion rings, not very good.",5
"Went here last weekend with my best friend and brother. This place Over exceeded my expectations! By far the best burgers and onion ring I’ve tasted! The drinks were so well portioned in taste and alcohol, can’t forget the amazing server ! Brian was amazing, my best friend my brother and myself felt at home. Been to Las Vegas many times but we will definitely make it a tradition to visit this amazing place. I’m amazed at the bad reviews I have just red , simply because we got the complete opposite. I just feel like some people eat their food when they’re are having a bad day and that isn’t fair for restaurants like these. I genuinely recommend this place 100% ! Don’t go off of reviews from others. Give it a try and I’m sure it won’t disappoint you! Thank you wahlburger for absolutely everything we got served this night ❤️ Will be coming back ver very soon.",5
"Service was awful. All of the staff was ridiculously rude and arrogant. The food is mediocre, the drinks are overpriced... And I'd like to once again reiterate VERY RUDE STAFF. Don't expect real service and DEFINITELY don't expect a smile or even common courtsy.",1
"I used to watch the show and saw how Paul cared about the food, well I hope he would be disappointed with what I had yesterday. It was ok but I was hoping it would be wow. I ordered an original medium rare, which is what I got, except the bun was bloody and soggy. And I'm talking about the top of the bun. Just really disappointed.",2
"I was in Vegas for a conference at work. My roommate really wanted to come to walhbugers. So I agreed. When we got there it was pretty busy at first they weren't sure that they were going to be able to give us a table for a while and then they literally had a table for us 10 seconds later, so that was nice. The girl told me I had to finish my drink from outside before coming in which wasn't a problem. the burgers were good but I wouldn't say they were the best burger that I've ever had. the drink I had was made of very long and pretty strong. Our server though took forever to get our drinks. Our food came out before our drinks I had to remind him that we ordered drinks. Overall it was an okay Burger but the drinks made the visit worth it.",4
"Nice place, nice atmosphere. Burgers are ok.",4
"Overpriced and subpar food. Fries were soggy, notified the server for fresh time. We ordered “The Our Burger” it was the size of McDonald’s single cheeseburger. This burger lacked seasoning to be $11.45 you think salt or pepper on the beef would be included. The lemonade was water down for $4.95.
The view of the Bellagio and its fountains was the best part. The server Carlos was nice. Will not dine here again.",1
"Yum! I went because it's Wahlburgers, I'll be back because the food was great.",5
"Absolutely phenomenal! We had Alma's mac and cheese, fries and burgers, I must say the food and service was top notch! One of the best burgers I have ever had! The fries, mac and cheese were perfect",5
"Awesome place! Had the Thanksgiving burger, was super good!",5
Order took long. Burgers are super small and not tasty. Everything is pricey especially for the quality . Staff was very nice.,2
I had the burgers and they where very good,5
"After being seated in the restaurant, we had to wait almost 20 minutes for waiter to get back with us and take the order. The burger was very small and cold. I ordered The doubledecker and NOTHING special about it at all. No flavor for an expensive price! Come on Mark!",2
Great food and atmosphere.,5
Delicious there BBQ suace omg loved it,5
Went there on vacation. Was the most wonderful food and so so good,5
"I was disappointed. We ordered the chili. It was flavorless and dry. The burger was juicy, but the bun was too soggy. We also ordered the tater tots and fries, and they tasted like fish; you can tell they were fried in the same oil. I was hoping for more. Don’t think I’ll come again",2
Good tasting food!,3
"Incredible staff ! Supper helpful and nice ! Great service, burger is ok, the poutine was good !",3
"Amazing burger!! Can't put my finger on how it's different, but it is one of the best burgers I've ever had!",5
"Went to walburgers last night in Vegas.Totally dirty.The hostess handed us sticky menus.Which I had to clean it with an alcohol wipe. Waiter cut us short while we were ordering The drink was too strong and had no strawberry lemonade  at all. Bartender mixed drinks unevenly. The hamburger was SMALL and sloppy. The fries were  short, cold and tasteless. And it was too expensive for the quality of food.",1
Best burger I've had in awhile. The servers were friendly and fast. Price is a bit high for smaller servings but the quality was on point.,4
"I absolutely loved it. The food was amazing and the customer service was excellent. I live in Salt Lake and unfortunately there isn’t a Wahlburgers here. The closest one is there in Vegas. It was beyond a shadow of a doubt, worth the trip. Wahlburgers is definitely a place that I can now recommend to all my friends who are going to Vegas. I will return there every chance I get from now on when I’m in Vegas.",5
Great customer service and the food was amazing . Waiter always kept on checking up on us and recommended a great cocktail . Would so recommend to my family & friends. I loved this place!!!! It’s a must go,5
"Come here everytime I'm in Vegas. Delicious burgers, good beer, and very friendly, welcoming staff. I had the Impossible burger, which was okay, but now I know, stick with the tried and true Wahlburger!",5
"Liked the place, the burgers were tasty and the prices very mild. Why are people complaining, you are on the Strip in Las Vegas and you pay 10 bucks for a burger, thats very reasonable else go to Mc Donalds. I had the mushroom burger, no meat but a burger made out of mushrooms, I liked it a lot. Nice place, nice location!",4
Delicious burger! The onion rings weren't anything special...they were really skinny. Fries were perfectly crispy and tasted great. Would definitely recommend the double burger!,5
"The burger was tasty, but the onion rings were too thin, in my opinion.",4
Great food..onion rings are out of this world,5
Drinks and burgers are really good! Definitely a little pricy but we didn’t mind spending because we were on vacation.,5
Super friendly and fast service. Forgot my dressing and cheese on my salad. Staff wore masks but did not wipe down menus between customers.,3
"Always the best service, best burgers in town and great vibe just walking in the door to this family's establishment. Thank you Paul for such amazing food. Wahlburgers rocks!!!",5
Good food. Layed back environment. Good price. Friendly attentive staff. Clean!,5
"Horrible service....or shall I say no service at all!
Maybe it was this black man and Hispanic woman, either way...we were seated,  order placed and 45 minutes later and not a single worker followed up or deivered any food. Eventually we left with no service.....this is the new normal.",1
Food was Great and the service was even better Carlos was the best writer definitely go here and ask for carlos,5
Over priced fried pickles of the size and amount they give you. The burgers were served cold. Over all a little disappointed because we drove from Arizona just to try this restaurant.,2
Good burgers and great customer service!,4
"I’m Apache Native and live in Texas, I’ve travel half around the world and I’ve eating great food everywhere........

Now that sets the stage for my comments, the food compared to where I come from “magnificent” , the flavor/ prep spices and ingredients  amazingly different but in a super great way, staff on there toes friendly, diverse , bilingual excellent work ethics , felt COVID free safe.......

Your , Manager ran the restaurant like a fine tuned machine,, Kuddos to manager and staff

Just great dang simple food made great, excellent work by the Wahlberg's most definitely

I did eat at other places on my visit but we found ourselves circling back to downtown Vegas Wahlberg restaurant.

I was hoping that Wahlberg's had more souvenirs such as

Metal Hot & Cold travel mugs w kids wrapped w Wahlberg Logos, Wahlberg’s shot glasses, bigger variety of tee shirts, pink for women or just a small expanded level of product line.....

Love the experience big time

God Bless",5
"Great burger and great attention to detail. Funky place and location. Need an ""in restaurant"" bathroom.",4
Delicious! Not the worst price on the strip either!,5
Best burger and best mac and cheese I have ever ate. So wish there was one near me,5
"It was disappointing the restaurant was dirty, our burgers did not have the ""special  sauce"" on them, had to ask for it, and I'm sorry but not worth the money,IN and OUT way better. Our fries were not fresh. Would not go back.Had to put my burger together pretty sloppy",2
13$ burger look and tasted like a hockey puck. Fry's soggy it was really bad. This was worst meal we had the entire trip. Plus no AC,2
Alright service and fries were way under cooked. Cheap bar food at best!,2
"Awesome burgers! very flavorful, a tad bit pricey but well worth it beats eating the other guys burgers will be coming back again with my family and would recommend this place to anyone also the staff was very friendly and professional.",5
"The burger was ok. I had the OFD, the bun was cold and the bacon was all stuck together which lead it to come out with the first bite. The burger meat itself was solid and a good size plus juicy so there is potential, the mushroom was flavorful. There was a sauce/flavor that more for a BBQ flavor burger than a mushroom. If your looking for a hearty fill you up burger place, this may be for you, before I forget, staff was friendly so I give credit to that as well.",4
"Good food, Vegas prices. Had the bacon BBQ burger, great flavor without any one element overwhelming the others.  Glad we stopped in.",5
"First Family Vacation to Las Vegas was a GREAT START!! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST LOCATIONS FOR WALHBURGERS, EVER!!!! Staff went above and beyond the call of Duty. all Items ordered and paid were correct. YOU GUYS DESERVE THE BEST RATINGS!!!! Even caught up with some comedy from the server. Excellent work.",5
All I had was the Mac n Cheese but I was thoroughly unimpressed. Flavor wise it reminded me of kraft mac n cheese. Really disappointing after thinking about it for a week before I was able to get it.,2
"Nothing special at all!!! A very, overpriced hamburger/cheeseburger. Personally I won’t go back. Burger is a good size. You’ll actually get a better deal, and better flavor burger at In & Out. But seriously lacking in taste. Mostly tasted onions. Very little sauce. And the staff I had experience with, blah. No excitement. No enthusiasm. Basically you’re paying for the name, because the burger and staff were both...BLAH.",2
"Over the course of a few days I went to Wahlburgers twice since it was convenient to our hotel. I really want to like it more than I do. The staff is great and very friendly at this location. Very cute space. First time I just had an adult Frappe, The Mud Pie. It was great! At about $15 it's a little pricey but I've found that's about average. Very generous on the liquor. Next time I picked up some mac n cheese and thin crispy onion rings. The mac n cheese should have just been called mac bc there wasn't enough cheese. Onion rings were good. I've had a burger in the past and just thought it ok. Not the best but not the worst. I guess I wanted to be blown away by the food but have just found it to be average.",3
"Absolutely amazing!!!!!!! I go everytime I am in town! The food is to die for, beyond Excellent, and the staff are friendly and quick, I highly recommend!!!!! :)",5
Great! I go Everytime I go to Vegas,4
Great Food!  Awesome service! Tyler was my server and he has awesome menu knowledge and makes great recommendations. Prices are really reasonable. Their photographer was great! Overall great experience in this location!!,5
"I’ve watched the show with assumption it’s going to be super delicious with an awesome experience. Boy, was I disappointed!! Visited the Vegas location let me start with the over priced burgers, the dining area awful,  so cold and dull. The burgers were so-so, secret sauce, what secret sauce? I should of gone to In N Out and got my money’s worth. Unfortunately, not worth a second visit. Sad. Sad. Sad. Couldn’t live up to the hype!!!",1
Great service and delicious burgers! Try the macaroni salad you will love it!,5
Donnie's choice bbq burger was Delicious 🙏,5
Not worth the money. My salad was old and the edges were going brown. My tots were cold and there was a hair in my food.,1
Soo. Good.  Will definitely be back.,5
Tonight was my second time at Wahlbugers and the staff the restaurant and the food is out of this world great. I am a die hard blockhead and love all of Donnie and Marks mo ies and shows and the food is sooooooooo good.,5
"Food good, coffee horrible",4
"So delicious, fast service, and great prices!!",5
"Great food, good environment and good service.",5
Delicious.  I gave the young lady who was the bartender an idea I had for a drink.  A grapefruit mule and instead of lime garnish use two grapes and call it Balls to the Wahl.,5
We ordered through grubhub and they messed up our expensive order badly and when we called the restaurant the manager insisted they didn't even use grub hub even though we had the online confirmation. We are very upset because we were really excited to eat the food from there. Would not recommend.,1
Great burgers! Fries are ok.  Great cocktail!!,5
Great service and good food,4
"Dude!  The fiesta burger was awesome and sweet potatoe bites were almost like a sweet treat.  Thanks Miguel!   I also bought one of the 'moms favorite' tshirts as a joke for my only son, lmao!",5
"Best burger. Service. Atmosphere,  ever",5
Awesome burgers!,5
Very good Burgers and onion rings. Fast and friendly staff.,5
"We went with a party of 7 and waited an hour. The staff brought us cups of water while we waited outside.  Great service. Good burger,  just a bit expensive.",3
"I cannot give enough praise, eat here at least once, you definitely won't regret it!!",5
Great food good prices and really nice staff.,5
"2/27/2021- Unhappy with service here & food was only ok. I eat very little so i ordered a side Cesar salad & chili. Salad was good, chili barley had any beans though flavor was just ok. Chili also only served in paper bowl. My issue with the service was that i was unable to finish my chili so i asked for a lid for the bowl & was told they had none.  What they did instead was provide a burger container (didn't really fit). I then asked for a soda cup which did have a lid for my chili. Server said she would go ahead & do that for me, took the chili. Well  that didn't happen all she did was cover the chili with foil wrap. Did not help, chili spilled all over the bag!
Prices were on the high side for burger's without fries/tots, are sold separately. Don't recommend a visit unless it's something you want to say you did.
No bathroom available though public ones were nearby. Due to COVID big parties are split into different tables & capacity is smaller as well. Even though smaller capacity server was slow to take order & responding to requests.",1
Loved the food! Great place!,5
Vegas location on point!!! Friendly service plus some keto friendly options on the menu as well as alcohol!!! 👍👍👍,5
Great food!!! Great service!!!,5
I had to try this place and none of us were disappointed(4 pple) and we ordered different things... my sis got the rootbeer float and loved it.. she wanted to go back there more than once just for that.  I had Donnie's favorite the barbecue bacon which comes with jalapenos boy it tasted so good meat was cooked medium well as I asked. All of our fries were crispy and are made pretty quickly idk if they just sit back there or  fried upon order but either way it still tasted fresh. in the end we wind up rushing out but wanted extra fries the guy said ill be back in a minute and he literally was.. everyone's burger was very good and made the way they wanted it..  just check where u sit because some tables and chairs were dirty i guess they need better turn around time cleaning but the food and drinks were on point i would definitely try them again wherever i find a location. Oh u dont have to get government cheese jus sub it like we did.(9/20),4
Daniels service was amazing.,5
"First time at a Wahlburgers and I must say it was what I expected, which was awesome! The food was cooked perfectly and the sides were seasoned well and very tasty! Would definitely recommend and return 👌",5
Great burgers. Actually best I have ever had. And friendly welcoming service. Very clean.,5
Really good burgers and the staff is awesome!,5
"Fresh ingredients, great food, and friendly staff.",5
"Short version : Not recommended.
Long Version: So, there's a concept of value i.e at some price point something is worth. That being said I got a cold burger and not evenly stuffed. All the stuff was on the one side and the other half was kinda empty. Also, not a good option to eat for vegan or vegetarian people.",1
We had a terrible experience ordered two burgers only got one order of fried pickles they came out burnt and the service was just rude I was very disappointed,1
"I was so excited to go eat here on my little girls trip weekend. But geeze the prices are so nuts. You have to get your sandwich, fries or whatever separate and then your drink. Food was good but not good enough for the price. Pop was almost$5.",3
We enjoyed our meal and the service was great.,5
"This was my first Wahlburger and it was pretty enjoyable. I ordered the ODF and it was really good burger, cooked exactly how I asked. It needed more of the tomato jam though. The sweet potato tots are also tasty, ask for the chipotle mayo on the side, it's a good combination.

The staff are quite slow though, I would have though working in Vegas that they would work at a faster pace.

Overall it was a really good burger but the service took away from he experience.",4
Burgers were awesome! Atmosphere was chill. Great customer service. 😎,4
"Good burger but over priced, then again I was in Vegas.",4
Great burger. Fast service. Great late night pit stop.,5
Absolutely love this joint. They set us up stairs and had a wonderful look out the garage door windows. Food came out a lil cold but the taste of the burgers made up for it.,5
Great food and great service!,5
Friendly staff and amazing food!!!,5
Good food tasted really fresh,4
"I had the best burger ever.  San Antonio definitely needs to get a Wahlburger. I had a simple cheese burger with a side of onion rings. The Wahl sauce was to die for. The atmosphere was perfect. They took a picture of my boyfriend and I which was so cute. My overall experience was great and the food was fantastic and the overall atmosphere was fantastic,  all of Mark's movies were on the wall. The staffing needs some work but nothing too bad that couldn't be worked out.",5
"Best burger I have ever eaten and possibly the best onion rings on the planet. The service was excellent, the restaurant was very clean, and the beer was ice cold. No complaints here!",5
"Pretty good burgers, open seating at bar can bypass a long seating wait",5
Sloppy Freakin Joe - Fantastic!,5
"Unfortunately the food was rather bland. Tried the ""Our Burger""a basic cheese burger, tater tots and macaroni salad.
The burger was rather small the tots were slightly warm and the mac salad looked good but had no taste. The quality of the food didn't meet expectaions.",3
"Food was pretty good. My mom really enjoyed her burger. Mine was ok, nothing to write home about. Server was slow and kinda short with us, not incredibly friendly. Not like the fun, exciting servers I read about in other reviews.",4
Hard to beat when you are after a burger,4
Walburger (the little drink shop not the burger joint)  is absolutely awesome.  Cheapest drinks in Vegas unless you're getting free ones in a casino while gambling.  Bartender is super polite and loves to help you come up with drink ideas!,5
"SO DELICIOUS 😋
🍔🍟🥤
I recommend for you to try the Root beer float😍
The burgers and fries are also tasty 🤤",5
"Probably the juiciest burger I've ever had. Loved the different dipping sauces and the tater tots, but the onion straws where way to salty.",4
Great burgers and tots,4
"$19 for an impossible burger, no air conditioning, and no restroom. The our burger was SMALL. Not worth the money. Go somewhere else.",1
Loves every thing 100% will be back,5
"What is the big deal about this place?

In and out is better than this cra....",1
"Got here with the family “late” at night and they were very accommodating having little children. Server was great wish I could remember his name. Food was excellent. Just wish the music wasn’t so loud, could barely hear conversation at our table.",4
We had placed an order to go and were sitting at a table outside. We were asked to move since customers were waiting in line to sit.  Very rude! I was a customer as well.  Also not the cleanest place. The podium was very dirty.,2
Oh yeah I got Donnie fab and sweet potato tots worth it,5
Good food at a reasonable price! We'll definitely coming back!,5
"one of the biggest rip offs i’ve ever had, impossible burger was not worth the $19 and didn’t even come with fries. rather go to w boujeer place, sorry mark 😢",1
"I was so excited to finally visit a Wahlburgers but was very disappointed. The meat was unseasoned, tasted only of ground beef and pepper and the fries were very soggy. The service was eh. Took forever for drinks and to get cashed out. Kind of a let down for an $80 meal for 3!",1
Really nice place for a burger..,5
The sandwiches are amazing and affordable. I had the chicken sandwich.,5
Amazing food and wonderful staff.,5
Really Good Burgers and It was really fun! Definitely recommend going there!!!,5
My burger was the bomb damn❤❤❤,5
Good burger! I had the Our burger. Nice restaurant would go again if near by! Very juicy and hits the spot a real treat!!!,4
"First time going heard good things about how wonderful it is.  I was very disappointed.  Burger was under cooked and bland.  The fries no taste.  The ice tea very good.  The service very good and friendly.  Unfortunately,  I will not being going back.",2
Amazing food! Great customer service! Loved the atmosphere.,5
The Thanksgiving burger was amazing. Crispy onion rings were on point. Love this place even if we didn't get to see the Wahlbergs. ;-),5
"I just had my first experience at the Wahlburgers on the Las Vegas Strip.  The dining area was clean and well designed, the customer service was great and the atmosphere is relaxing.  As for the food, the burgers and fries were good but not great.  I still prefer Shake Shack when it comes to the quality of their food. Nonetheless, I still recommend Wahlburgers for their operational efficiencies.",4
Solid burger but I didn’t think it was anything special. I wasn’t impressed with the fries.,3
"It is a nice place, food is really good, although expensive for ""Fast food"",because it is not a traditional fast food. It is very very loud in the restaurant, especially music because of which people are shouting. Great lemonade!  Good Job Wahlberg Bros;).",4
Food and service was on point 😋,4
Freaking good no great! Hamburger the way it's to be no frills simple genuine. Good comfort food.,5
Make sure you check what's in the bag before you leave the restaurant or you will get back to your room with half a meal like we did !! And when you call to complain ask twice about the opening hours because they don't seem to have a clue lastly when you go back in person and get to speak to a member of management staff don't expect an apology if your lucky you will get the money back for what was missing!! Very poor 1st and last visit don't bother going its not worth it.,1
Not sure what all the hype s' about. I love the Wahlberg's so I was hoping for much more. We came late at night and it wasn't very busy but still our food wasn't hot and fresh. The worst part was the annoying lady who took our pictures & bothered us while we were still eating. I appreciate that you're trying to create a moment but you should let people finish eating their food before you try and sell them stuff!,3
Great burger!  I loved it,5
It was a good burger but the bun looks like it comes from an 8 pack for a $1 @ Walmart. Super over priced!!! Plus they have a chick trying to sell you pictures....,2
"Very friendly, attentive staff. Slightly on the more expensive side, if you order a soda it's a little over $5 but it comes in a quality wahlburgers cup that you keep",5
Good food and real good service.,5
One of the best burgers I’ve had. I ordered The Melt and it was very good. The place is very busy though.,5
Honestly I was pretty disappointed....Wendy's makes a better hamburger 🍔 and I don't even like wendys....the sweet potato fries were pretty good.....overall nothing special SORRY MARK !!!!,3
Normally a good spot. Not today.,1
A tad expensive but overall great food and service!,5
Really great burgers! Very clean awesome service.,5
"Super great, fresh food, staff educated about gluten free & gluten friendly options. Great value for prices",5
Best burger I've had in a long time. Staff was friendly and service was top notch!,5
I've had better,4
Definitely the best burger in Vegas!! And I say that having also had In-N-Out and Fatburger.,5
"Would have give this a 4 star but the price brings it down to 3 star, the burgers we're good, I had a double and the wife had a impossible burger (vegan that tastes like meat) the chips where small and for $83 including two drinks I think it was well over priced since there is alot of other same if not better burger joints around with half the price",3
The portobello sandwich was amazing!!!!,5
It was ok. Nothing special. Prices were on par for The Strip.,4
This was our first and probably last experience at Wahlburgers. I've been waiting for a while to partake in this restaurant being a fan of the Wahlburg Brothers. Reservations required? Less than 25% seating and the service is SLOW. Received an odd tasting drink 10 minutes before they graced us with our other drinks. I like the idea of the menu but our fries came out stale and cold. My husband's burger was undercooked and the Sloppy Joe I ordered was cold. Everything served on plastic containers and to go cups. Definitely not what I expected. The McDonald's next to Harrahs was more on point than this place. That was even with their D team working.  Save yourself the time and money. Pro- They give a 10%military discount but the food isn't worth the other 90% you pay. Good idea but bad service. Thumb way down 👎👎👎.,1
"We had an excellent experience! The sloppy joe sandwich is a MUST!! Th staff was great, the food was great, worth the 45 minute wait!",5
Amazing burgers. I especially like the onion straws option instead of fries,5
Sad to say we were very disappointed. My husband and I visited the Las Vegas Strip location on Monday evening. 10-19-20... Had traveled all day and went in for a late dinner. Service was good. FOOD SUCKED. No other way to put it. I paid $15 for a small CUP of cardboard mac & cheese with some small pieces of chicken that tasted like Vegas smells. I ate maybe a fourth of the cup and had to stop. Husband ate the Fiesta Burger.. said it was ok but would never go back.,1
Server forgot about us. Burger I ordered was supposed to have bacon but came with nothing other than mushrooms and tomato jam. Not that good for the price. Had to try but not going back,3
Myself and 5 others dined in the food was very good. We all got burgers and onion rings. The beer was alittle on the warm side.The customer service was not friendly at all. And to top it off our booth broke the whole bottom part came off. No apologies were given or anything. We will not be returning to this particular Wahlburgers.,3
"Food great, staff friendly.",5
Wouldn’t even recommend this to the malnourished. Terrible service for a world famous restaurant. Our table wasn’t even seated!!!!! Expected way more,1
"The food and service was great and for Vegas, the prices are very reasonable. Great meal!",5
"Thalia was great, she was polite and we enjoyed her company.
Food was delicious. Best onion rings I've ever tried, not heavily battered.
Almost lost a star bc Mark was not there, unfortunately.
Not sure why he wouldn't be there when I went, disappointing.
I did get a picture with his cutout, so I suppose it made up for it.",5
The food here was outstanding... and the service was great!,5
"Great food, people.",5
This place definitely took us by surprise! To start off the hostess was very sweet and got us a table right away. The burgers here were off the charts and the food came out incredibly quick. Angel our server was FANTASTIC! He was very attentive and enthusiastic. By far some of the best service we have had!,5
"I've had Wahlburgers in the Mall of America, it was amazing.

This was, meh. I ordered a burger salad to go. Never even had the nerve to eat it, looked like a 1/8# burger (ala McDonald's) on top of a wilted salad.

Restaurant was HOT. it was 107°F outside,  felt like 120+ inside. Was glad to get out of there and cool off outside!

Selfie with the Wahlberg's was worth the stop.",2
An incredible burger. I can not wait to go back here and order my Thanksgiving Day burger again,5
I love this place! Food amazing and I always make sure to go here every time we’re in town. The burgers and fries are amazing! The margaritas are delicious and you can keep the glass it comes in. (Can’t remember if it was extra charge or not?),5
One of the best tasting burgers I've had but Damn is it pricey,5
It was our first time here.. I wasn’t impressed at all.. for what we paid I didn’t feel it was worth it.. Ave our server was okay..,3
"Good food,  not bad prices for vegas strip",5
"As soon as we drove into Las Vegas for a pit stop I wanted to come here to try the burgers.  I was not disappointed! It was late (11pm) so we got a table pretty much immediately. Food took a minute, but was so worth the wait. Thought possibly the quality would have dipped because of how busy it tends to be there, but the food was amazing! Staff friendly and quick with whatever we needed.",5
One of the best burgers i’ve ever tried.,5
"Holy snap.  This one caught me by surprise. Coming off of Super Duper which is fantastic... This is my preferred taste. The meat is seasoned well and cooked the way I asked. The bun is minimal, soft and does not interfere with the taste of the meat. Good stuff!  I highly recommend.",5
Good food and came out really fast!! Will come back again.,5
"The staff were friendly but the burgers were disappointing. Pretty bland. Had better fast food burgers than this. Also, my husband was super annoyed by the pressure from the lady who took our photos supposedly for free. Yet, tried to sell it for $15 each which was $60. Then lowered it to $40 down to $5. We won’t be going back!",2
"Burgers are excellent, one of the best ever. Couldn't even take a pic of the burger because it was gone too quick.",5
"Love the food, and atmosphere. It was very pricey for the little amount of food that is offered. Was eating Alma's macaroni and it had hair in it YUCK!",3
"Overpriced, small burgers, truffle fries carried",2
To expensive for a Burger that is not that good......,3
"Super Duper!, Good Food!!!",5
What a great burger! Great service too and if you sit upstairs there is a great view of the center of the strip!,5
"Came to visit Vegas, this place is reasonable and have really good food. I love the onion rings",5
Nothing too special. OK burgers OK service. BBQ sauce is spiced ketchup. The wahlski beer is worth a try.,3
Great service and good tasty burgers. The chipolte mayo sauce so good with fries,5
"Very nice palce! Great food, great service. Totally recommend it. Try their Mark's choice on the menu.
🤤🤤🤤",5
"Get the onion rings, they're the most addicting things! They're drinks are really good too. It was a little awkward at first because we didnt know how to order our food, but we figured it out, haha",4
"Pleasantly surprised by this chain. The burgers are very clean. Not a lot of mess, and very neat. I'd visit a local store if we had one. The wait staff was happy and helpful. There is a store photographer taking pictures inside and provides a free post card. They offer a $20 larger photo. Always awkward to have to say no after they've printed it for you to see! That's the only thing they could nix is the photographer...",5
Great food and ambience!,5
Not What-a-Burger but good standard burger. No combos here everything is separate. The drinks are good and what brings everything together is the great customer service.,4
"GREAT FOOD ! Nice atmosphere, GREAT PEOPLE.  Wahlburgers on the Vegas strip rocks ! EAT HERE. YOU WILL LOVE IT ! 🍔🍟",5
"Clean, friendly and delicious. Plus the cups are cool AF",5
The food here is delicious and the service is nice. It’s a little unreasonably priced though.,4
Enjoyed a tasty burger with avocado and jalepeno. Not a bad place to eat if you find yourself near Bally's.,5
Very small place.  Service was fine but it is way overpriced.  I have been to several Wahlburgers but these prices are over the top.,3
"VERY tasty burgers and friendly staff. Only issue is parking, but it's worth the walk!",5
"The food is super delicious!! The tater tots and OFD burger are my favorite! Great atmosphere! Awesome customer service and fast service! There is a full bar to enjoy with a good variety of beer. It's a bit pricey but hey you're in Vegas,  everything is lol, but it's worth it!! Love it! #Donniegirl<3",5
Average burger high prices had to try it at least once,3
I loved this place I went to the ones in Vegas and North Hollywood great service and good food just wish the fries came with the meal Instead of having to pay separate but it was good I'd go back I liked the double decker burger very good,5
Really good and great service!,5
"Not a whole lot of good to say about this place. Just an ordinary burger and not quite hot frys. Over price soft drinks, $4.95 for a Coke is a little much, but it’s the new Las Vegas I guess. Grilled onions that needed to be grill a lot longer. Bacon on the burger tasted like pre cooked bacon that was room temp.",3
"Wahlburgers should be heavily considered when in Las Vegas. Quick and solid service. High quality food, made to order. The ambiance is right on target for any time or occasion. Make it your next stop, you won't regret it.",5
Would leave a 0 if I can. Walked in my party of 6 said table was dirty then completely forgot about us.,1
What's there not to like about Walburgers?! Foods great!,5
"The burger was amazing!

We are from Canada though and the onion rings were not what we were expecting. They weren't bad just definitely not the typical onion rings you normally get. I definitely wouldn't order them again nor do I think any of my table would. We would likely stick with fries but the overall the food was amazing!",4
Food is good. Service was on par. Prices were overdone!,4
"Delicious. Nice drink comb, burger was tasty and well priced.",4
Not very impressed. Had much better burgers and fries.,2
Way over priced,3
The double decker burger was good but not worth $15...we’ve had the same taste from for instance Applebee’s. The onion rings were...pretty much only grease. Didn’t taste onions at all. I wanted to give it a 2 but we love the Wahlbergs and husband loves Blue Bloods so he wants to support! If there was a 2.5 he would’ve gone for that. We bought on the Vegas strip and took back to hotel w/ our Walgreens-bought libations. 🤣,3
Delicious food. The burgers are awesome. This place wasn't too busy during lunch hour on a rainy Wednesday. Staff was friendly and attentive. Definitely recommend for their burgers. Fries and floats are delicious as well.,5
"Absolutely amazing food. I had the thanksgiving burger and it was phenomenal. Definitely coming back. The service was really good as well. Nice staff, really attentive. WORTH IT!",5
Omg best burger,4
"We're locals and our experience was great! Really loved the restaurant and it was clean, they also have patio seating. Really fast service too. Cannot stress enough how clean the restaurant was !",5
"They will rob you. It’s very rare that I would 1 star anything.

I just want to warn anyone that comes to this restaurant that they will rob you. I was going to wait to review, in hopes that they would fix their mistake, but they have not, and I don’t believe they will. We went a few weeks ago as a family, it was over $55 for the three of us. We paid the bill, and one week later they charged us the same amount again. At first I thought it was a mistake on my banks part, but after going through my bank report, I found that WAHLBURGERS charged us twice. I called and spoke to the manager, Carlos, and he assured me that they would look into it if I just sent him the receipt via email. I sent the receipt and he promised that he would refund our account. After 4 days, I had heard nothing. I contacted Carlos again, and he, yet again, assured me that it was being processed and takes up to 5 business days. It has now been 8 business days and I have not received the refund. I literally spent over $100 on a couple burgers and there’s no telling if they will charge me again! My parents had also come with us, and they were charged twice too. Don’t go. It’s not worth the money or the hassle.

**UPDATE**
The dispute has been settled as of October 27th. It took a month, and getting my bank involved to get the dispute settled and get my money back, but my bank was able to eventually get it.",1
"My boyfriend and I stopped here because it was recommended to us from some friends. We found that we wanted to try everything one the menu, but decided to split a burger and the mac & cheese with chicken. Unfortunately I don't remember what burger we got. The food was unbelievably amazing! We also loved the drink menu and the souvenir up. The best part about eating here was the pricing. It is definitely very reasonable compared to a lot of restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip. The atmosphere was great, friendly, and very clean and tidy. The staff was great as well, thanks for making our experience a good one. We can not wait to make this stop again in Las Vegas or even the upcoming Chicago restaurant since it is closer to home.",5
"After waiting too long to be served at the Cheesecake Factory across the street, Wahlburgers was a pleasant surprise. We opted to sit at the bar, where there was no wait for seats. All 3 bartenders were pleasant and accommodating. There was a mistake on our bill and it was taken care of immediately. The Our Burger is the best I've ever had, and they can accommodate gluten free diets. The only downside was the music was a touch too loud.",4
"Service was great, burger wasn't extraordinary ,and it definitely wasn't worth $48.00",4
Burgers are good and are cooked surprisingly fast...like Jimmy John's fast. Moderately priced.,4
Great GF options.   Server was pretty awful and slow .  Real pricey but great tasting,3
Great food.  Wonderful staff. I will be returning to this restaurant when i return to Vegas in near future.,5
"I stopped into the Las Vegas outpost of Wahlburger to have the double-decker burger, which was surprisingly not crappy. This was my first experience at any Wahlburger, and I expected to be writing this review with a vituperative bent but I have nothing but good things to say about this burger: beefy, well-seasoned, well-flavored, lovely melty cheese -- and an outer char on both 3-ounce patties that was delicious and texturally nice. Thick crispy pickle slices were mild and pleasant, obviously made in house instead of being jarred or canned. The ""Wahl"" sauce, the so-called family secret, tasted like Thousand Island dressing mixed with Sriracha Sauce. It served the burger well.

I'm from the Boston area originally, which is not a burger-y part of the country, so it's not like Wahlburger is representing a cuisine or is ""serious food."" Indeed, there's no regional yardstick to measure Wahlburger's ""authenticity"" against -- although the Las Vegas service staff is undoubtedly more attractive than you would find in Massachusetts. Beyond that, this really is its own thing. I don't watch the show, nor do I care to. Judging the product by what was served to me, I was very pleased -- my only big quibble being that $13 feels like the wrong price on the Vegas strip, where good, cheap burgers are plentiful.",4
We went to the location located at Las Vegas Strip. I must say we were expecting a mouth full of goodness and unfortunately we did not get that. Our Hamburgers were tasteless my daughter ask for no onions and guess what she got. We ended up getting NO sauce on any of our Hamburgers and the onions has plenty of grease but no flavor. Needless to say we are and were very disappointed.  We will not be going back to this place again. I think the higher ups definitely need to check out this location....,1
Great food! I’m coming from Arizona. Our server Freddy was fantastic and deserves a raise!!,5
"Over priced food, wack service. They serve their food in paper and plastic products to save on dishes and washing labor. Terrible spot.",2
My server Jaime was a consummate professional. i had a pleasurable experience here,5
LOVE!! We've eaten here three times in 2 days and plan on going back several more times before we leave. Staff and management are phenomenal! Food is on point as usual. We had a small issue with the way our burger was cooked and it was handled with immediate attention and the type of care you would expect when you watch the boys on the show. I am constantly impressed with every Wahlburgers I go to. I sure do wish the family would come to Dallas!!,5
Great burgers i got to say I was a little skeptical but after I would have to say one of my top five burgers wish they had one in okc,5
Great atmosphere! We had the Sloppy Joe and the Truffle Burger. Got our pictures taken!,5
I have been to this location 6 times. I can say i have always had amazing service and delicious food. Unfortunately on this visit the server messed up 3 of the 4 orders to include one of the 3 burgers was served without a  bottom hamburger bun. The bottom half of the bun was missing. My friend was reluctant to ask if it was supposed to be like that but she finally did. The server corrected it right away but i was disappointed considering i had talked Wahlburgers up to my friends for weeks. I am giving 4 stars based off my multiple visits and i wont fault a delicious burger due to one faulty employee. Food is great i just hope no one else has a one off experience like we did.,4
Great turkey burger,5
The best burger I’ve ever had...period. Amazing! Clean place very good food you will not be let down I promise.,5
"The service was good and the food was delicious. I got the bbq burger with jalapeños, soooo tasty. I would go again.",5
Great burger but did not enjoy their odd onion rings.,3
"Very clean, great location in back of a bazaar. Simple but detailed menu with burgers, hot dogs, and more. Family oriented and welcoming environment. Only complaint they didn't have a mom's favorite t shirt in my size lol",5
"I love Wahlburgers! Gluten free buns and delicious burgers! Wish there was a location near Buffalo, NY. Great service at the Boston and Vegas locations we've been to and always busy!",5
Food & service was excellent.,5
"The food was ok. The staff were not friendly, and the burger was pink (asked for well done). Had high hopes and was disappointed for sure. The burger was a good burger, but wahlburger should know how to cook a meat patty.",2
"Horrible waitress rude and snippy was to busy running away to help us table was sticky and place was dirty . System wouldn’t allow me to redeem pints for freebies. Talk to manager nothing changed. Waited forever. No one ever checked on us. Food was not good. Greasy
So glad I wasted my time on money on this
Will never go to another one
Doesn’t live up to hipe
Go eat somewhere else",1
Honestly the wife and I both did not care for wahlburgers unfortunately. My father told me this is a great restaurant... unfortunately we were mislead. The fries were flavorless and the burgers were bland. The only reason for 2 stars is because the cups are neat and you get to take them with you.,2
"Amazingly friendly staff made the experience all the more worthwhile during our trip to Vegas. Fun location, great entertainment channels on, and a nice atmosphere. Food was on point. Will come back every time I'm in Vegas.",5
"Fantastic tasting food, good customer services.",5
"The place was hopping. Quick service and the food was good.  Price was a little more then I had expected for a more fast foodish type burger place.  But for Vegas wasn't out there by any means.  But a huge bonus, tots!  And you get to keep your glass which is nice when you pay $5 for a Coke.",4
"Wasn't impressed for the price!

Update: Ok felt I should elaborate on this a bit. The food was good, BUT $50 for A patty melt, a burger, 1 fry, a beer and a soft drink?",3
"My wife and I really wanted to try the impossible burger Whalburg style.
The good: we were seated quickly on a Saturday night. Service was quick and or good came out pretty quick. The special Whalburg sauce was delicious and we got to keep our head cup.
The bad: there's no bathroom within the restaraunt. The food arrived cold, our burgers were room temperature, the noise level was excessive (it's Vegas, after all). The impossible burger didn't taste all that amazing - compared to Fatburgers.
Conclusion: go to Fatburgers to enjoy the impossible burger there, it's only $9 compared to $18 at Whalburgers and it's way way way more tasty there. This review is entirely for the impossible burger, because that's all we are there minus the fat fries and onion rings - which tasted fine.",4
Thank you to the amazing server I believe his name was William that we had here on our visit to Vegas. How you treated us was amazing and the most respectful server I have met. Thank you for making our first experience here amazing! And delicious food,5
"I now and have always went out of my way to go have a burger at this place when in Vegas. I highly recommend trying it at least once and you won't be disappointed. I've had a lot of good burgers but what makes this place different is the bun for starters which is what you would least expect when having a hamburger. But as for the meat it is perfectly seasoned And don't know with what, plus if you do medium cooked like don't mind a little pink it makes it 10 times more tastier!!

Other than the burger I would say that's just about it that stands out compared to other spots. So when it comes to fries and other sides I think they can add a little something better because those are just OK.",5
literally have never eaten a better burger!,5
Food was fricking awesome!  I was very surprised.  Give it a try!,5
This place has such a beautiful relaxing setting food was amazing and not highly priced,5
"A little expensive, but hey, this is in Vegas and it is a reality show restaurant. Overall, good service and the food is good not great.",4
"OMG, the absolute best hamburger I've ever had. I'm not usually the hamburger type but hands down the best EVER!! Thanks to the Wahlberg brothers for sure!!!",5
"We were actually very surprised at how great the food was. It was just a burger and some chilli, but my partner absolutely loved his burger! He said it was the best one he had while we were on vacation. I would love to see one open up here on the east coast so we could visit more often! But if we ever go back to Vegas we will definitely dine here again.",5
"We had a great experience on the night of 9/1.  My husband left his wallet on the counter and one of the servers was so kind as to return it to him. Then as we were leaving of course our daughter left her backpack purse at her seat. The waitress ran out and hand delivered it to her.
There is nothing like going to a place where they have honest people working and make you feel like family. Not only that our waitress provided great customer service. Great burgers and Wahlbowls. Oh, and don't get me started on their onion rings. Those were amazing. Highly recommend. Pricey but worth it.",5
"One of the best burgers I've ever had. For the location, it's fairly priced. Definitely worth checking out. Usually is pretty busy though, so expect a little bit of a wait. Atmosphere is a little noisy, but it's not trying to be fancy or anything.",5
"Small portions and ala cart, not impressed.",2
Turkey Burger was dry and nasty!!!,1
Just a basic burger. IN & OUT is a better value for your money.,2
"Food quality and service = Good not great.

It's a busy fast/casual restaurant on the strip, so it's a bit overpriced & service suffers from a ""They won't be here again."" mentality like most mid-range restaurants on the strip.

That being said, if they're going for the ""treated like one of 9 children in a triple decker house"" experience, Wahlbugers totally nails it.",4
Lived up to the hype. Has to be a top 10 all time!!,5
"Ordered to go! Staying at Bally's!  Didnt get our Tatar tots, would have loved to try them! And I did pay for them! Chili was great, no crispy torts , that said I was supposed to get. Immediately called. Phone busy for last 15 min. Oh well !! This is Vegas😮😫",4
"We came here on 2nd March 2020.
Got to be one of the best burgers I have ever had.
Lettuce and onion were so fresh and the favour of the burger.
They really know how to do a burger.

Staff very polite and friendly.
We will definitely be back.",5
"Great burger, great tots!  A must visit in each city we find one!",5
"The burgers are delicious 😋. Fries are not included with the burgers, but you get to keep the cups which is pretty cool",5
"The food was really good and the prices are not bad, my only reason for giving 4/5 is due to my ""dine in"" service. The waiter took about 20mins after bringing the water to take our order and the place was bot at all busy at the time. But other than that it was a nice experience.",4
"The food was good, but the food poisoning from it was not.  3 people in my party of 4 were sick within 1-2 hours after eating here.  It's a shame too because the food was pretty good.",2
"Good experience, I tried the chicken sandwich and it got pretty soggy and messy which I didn’t like but nice in flavor. The waitress was really nice and made sure our experience was good, the price seemed high especially since everything was sold individually but overall nice experience.",3
"I couldn't wait to try this place I love them in movies and their show. Omg, music was a versatile vibe like the music was all over the place to please everyone and it was perfect. The burger perfect!!!!!!! But let me tell you about the SERVICE, DANIEL was EXCELLENT. @Chicfila has to go back to training and catch up. (No shade their service @chicfila is still great but his was just 10 times better. But I had to remember that this is still a burger joint!!!! Oh their Ranch sauce is a no for me, but it's not Heaven I'll get over it.",5
Although the prices were a bit higher than expected this was a great treat. Even though it was crowded we were seated quickly by very friendly hostesses.  Our server appeared quickly with menus and took our drink orders while we were deciding on our entrees.  The bar attendant brought the drinks in a timely manner with a cheerful smile.  Our server then came back to take our orders.  Our food was delivered quickly and to perfection.  It was very tasty and the portions were great for the prices.  There was also a lady taking souvenir photos.  The decorations on the walls were great showing the family's other accomplishments and a wall had the family story.  This is going to be on our list of places to visit upon our return!! Great job everyone!!!,5
Yummy burgers with great portions of sides!,5
"We love wahlburgers even more than before, I am now on a low sodium diet so I asked our waitress if they could prepare my burger with no salt.  She checked with the chef and there was no problem.  Burger was wonderful as usual.  Of all of the restaurants we ate at in Las Vegas, there 4 days, this was the only one that knew what a low sodium diet was and was prepared for it.

Thank you",5
"Hands down the best burger you will ever eat! So juicy and flavorful and the cheese is just spectacular. Topped off on the white toasted bread you can't beat it. The fries are also amazing. Love the location and service as well, definitely reccomend it!",5
Soooo good! We ate there twice! You get to keep your cup.,5
"Great service, nice atmosphere and tables aren't squished in. Burgers were big so I opted for a kids burger (3oz). It was perfectly sized! Nothing super special about the burger I had (so glad there were no detectably fatty bits in it) - just an overall good burger place.",5
Always a must have when visiting Vegas.  Delicious!!!,5
It was nice to be able to say I went.,3
Love this burger jount!,4
Covid 19 booth screen protection looks amazing. Felt very comfortable eating a delicious burger!,5
"First time coming here, the service was great the burgers were amazing it's a must to come and check out.",5
"If you love cheesy touresty places then you'll love this place. If you want good food then I suggest you pass. There are so many different places you could eat for about the same price.. I truly wasn't impressed with the food here, so sad. Oh well live and learn.",2
They have photographers who take un-solicited photographs and ask for money. This isn’t time square....,1
"We've enjoyed each experience we've had at Wahlburgers. The food is fantastic. The atmosphere is fun! We sat at the bar and got amazing service. The next time we visit Vegas, we will be back!",5
Very clean restaurant and great service staff. I have eaten a ton of burgers in my day and without a doubt their burger was hands down the best I have ever eaten. Don't pass this place up because you will not be disappointed.,5
Finally got to try Wahlberg burger in vegas! Very good cant wait until they build one in columbus ohio,5
Sabrina is Awesome!,5
Homey and inviting atmosphere.   Good food but nothing extraordinary.   It sticks close to home cooking which is what is advertised.   The hours are also really late so great for an evening meal after casino hopping.,4
great place to eat marke mark is always great service anywhere las vegas la Hollywood,5
food was delish. Atmosphere was great. Server Talia was on point. Will definitely be back!,5
"First time here, loved the food and the customer service. No tables, but the bar is full service and the staff was great. The margaritas are the best! Prices are decent compared to other places in Vegas.",5
Place is just great everytime,5
"1st time customer, and burgers tasted good!

Decor and vibe of this place was nice, filled with Walburg movie posters and pictures of the family.",4
This is the happiest place ever! The staff greeted you with the biggest smiles and made you feel so welcome!! The general manager(?) was the icing on the cake!!! AND the food was fabulous!! Wish I could give 10 stars! They deserve it! Well done Wahlburgers! You've set the bar VERY HIGH!!!,5
"Really,  really good burgers",5
"Where to start... The burger was good, really good. However the food was REALLY expensive, two beers, a burger, chili (served with a plastic spoon) and chicken wings should not come to $100. A steak dinner with my partner would have cost the same.. This was not a fine dining restaurant, load rap music, bright lights and hard metal chairs. I was shocked when I got the bill and will never be back.",2
After watching the show for several seasons we thought it would be one of the best in business. Sad to say it was not. We ordered the Our burger and it was good and juicy BUT it tasted like an average burger. The Arnold Palmer (in a souvenir cup) was not sweet. The staff were very nice. A lady came around to take a pic claiming it was for the business but once we received our check another person came to the table with 3 pictures to purchase as souvenirs. The sweet potato tots were like any other. I don't think I would try this place again.,3
Sat for a good 10 minutes and server never came. Bad service.,1
"My husband and I are attending the Sema show and decided to visit this famous restaurant with the understanding Vegas is extremely busy and the strip can be very expensive.  We were pleasantly surprised.  At the time of our visit, The restaurant was very busy. The hostess joyfully greeted us and promptly had us walk to the back to be seated, where we were immediately seated. The waitress, Davina, is knowledgeable on the product, hospitable, and attentive.  The burgers were delicious and reasonably priced. The burgers were a perfect blend of meat  and condiments. Over all, the customer service and food supersede the typical Las Vegas restaurant. The complete experience was 10/10.  We recommend anyone to experience Wahlburgers and ask for Davina as their waitress.",5
"Made a early morning stop before flying home, because our burgers were so awesome last time we visited on vacation. Our breakfast was awesome! Thank you for offering vegetarian options!! Friendly staff, clean, delicious food, prompt service.",5
I had a bowl of chili and a side of fries. They have the beat tasting chili I've had in a LONG time. And I'm very picky about my chili. I highly recommend it. Plus the staff is really friendly and very knowledgeable about the food they serve.,5
Very good burgers! My little one loved the Mac and cheese. The onion rings are amazing! Wonderful service as well. Will most definitely go back!,5
"Our group of 4 was able to be seated fairly quickly despite it being a busy weekend night. However, expect to wait if you come during rush hour as the area is small so turnover is not as quick. This was our first time trying this restaurant and was recommended by a friend. We loved it! It was so delicious and everything tasted fresh. We got seated at the bar overlooking the chefs making handpulled noodles. Im glad we were able to sit at the bar. The service from ordering and good coming was fairly quick. The prices were affordable and portion size was perfect.",4
"Excellent Burger fare albeit a bit pricey. Located in Bally's food area and challenging to get there even with paid parking. Our food server, Alex, was friendly, attentive and went out of her way to make sure we had a satisfying dining experience.",4
"I didn't give 2 stars cause of the food. I gave it cause of hostess and there is no restrooms for the guests.  My kids were with me and my 4 year old had to go. Since no restrooms I had to take to the outdoor public bathroom in the middle of the bars.  For such a "" family owned "" business, I would think that they would keep families in mind.  Now on to the hostess,  I  gave my name.  Said 3 kids & 2 adults.  She said 10 minute wait.  30 minutes later after a group of 7 came up handed her a 10.00 she put them in front of us. I get I am in Vegas, but we are not at the club. And if I knew that's how Wahlburgers rolls. I would have doubled it.  It's hot outside. Now the food. It was good, probably top 3 burger I have had and top onion rings.  Now 100.00 for 3 kids meals and 2 adults is crazy but again it's Vegas. Put a bathroom in and get rid of the hustler hostess and it might be 5 stars.",2
Delicious,5
"We went within a week of reopening after covid-19. No wait time. Nice, friendly wait staff and good burgers. Their onion rings were very thin cut and super yummy!",4
These burgers are bomb...get to this place and try em out.,5
"You can tell this burger was made by a chef not a cook, great burger!",5
They are open!!! We were the only people there at lunch time. The food was hot and fresh. So delicious! Welcome back!,5
The burgers are great and very fast service. Plus they serve alcohol.,5
Great burger but I do not feel they are worth the price. Service was quick and good atmosphere. A la cart so nothing is included with the burger.,4
"Me and my wife came to Vegas and we knew we had to try wahlburgers and I’m not gonna lie the food was absolutely amazing, service was great, employees were friendly and we couldn’t be more impressed.",5
This place lives up to the hype from the TV show. One of the best burgers I've ever had. Great onion rings and great service! I will definitely go back the next time that I am in Vegas.,5
"The food was just ok, service was definitely lacking.",3
Horrible ..dirty...greasy floor and I got food poisoning,1
Did not live up to the hype that every one portrayed this place having,3
Get food nice people,5
"Diana, our server, was amazing! She was so sweet and knowledgeable about the restaurant. I would come again just to talk to her. This is a great restaurant and well worth the trip to eat here!",5
"Was on a business trip and decided to stop by.  We were lucky and didn't have to wait, however noticed a long wait on most nights.  Ordered their classic burger and wasn't disappointed.  Although not the best burger I ever had, was cooked to order and was delicious.  However, it seems bit pricey (burger alone was $13 without side items or drinks).  Overall, I would still recommend unless you are on a tight budget.",4
I had a great time at Wahlburgers. I love the pictures and the people that work there they are so nice. They make you happy!!! I ate two days in a row.🥰🥰🥰.,5
"Ate at Wahlburgers again.  9/15/19 5:43 pm.  Counter was dirty never got wiped down. Vanessa slung us the menu and asked us what we wanted to drink.  We asked for a minute.  I ordered a Fiesta burger and received it but there was no bottom bun.  It had dissolved in the grease.  Really. No bottom bun.  There are many burger places in Vegas that I am willing to try another.  So long Wahlburgers your burger was horrible and the service wasn't much better.  It appears to me the shine has gone off the apple.  And you know it wasn't,t busy for them to rush the process.",1
"I was just wandering not really looking for anything when I stumbled across Wahlburgers.  I had heard good things about it in the past and swung in to check it out.

I judge a place on how well they do their onion rings and these guys get top marks.  They do a non-traditional thin ring, but they pack some serious flavor.  I topped it off with a Wahlbrewski which was also a winner.

This joint is a great find in the middle of an area that was really for a lack of a better term, run down.  If you find yourself nearby stop in and enjoy.",5
Food is to die for...Service is always outta site!,5
"One of the best burgers I’ve had. Perfect bun, perfectly crafted, perfectly sauced and seasoned, and restaurant is modern and very fitting to the kind of food served. Good job Paul!",5
"Awesomely good food. Good prices. Good service.
I had the Bacon Arugula salad w chicken. Super fresh and HUGE !  Dressing was delicious and just the right amount. My wife had a crispy haddock sandwich and onion rings.  Both were outstanding as well. The onion rings were thin, very lightly breaded and not greasy at all - among the best I’ve ever tasted.  I recommend !",5
"Nice clean place! Had to check it out while in town as I watch their show. Very reasonable price, and the burgers where good. I got the sweet potato fries I would recommend getting the potato fries instead wasn't really a fan of the sweet potato fries. Staff super friendly, I would recommend to stop by and grab something to eat.",4
I was impressed! Expected just another hyped up burger but this was delicious! The Tots! The tots had just the right crunch to potato ratio. Order a soda and keep the cup! Great service! Of course it cost more than the Arches! Totally worth it!,5
Great burger. All around. Wasn't disappointed. We got there pretty busy they sat us down within minutes. Waiter cane took or order an food was out quick. Wahlburgers keep up the great work. Wish I had pics of the food but to hungry.,4
"Oh sweet Jesus, the best burger I think I've ever had. At least top 3. I can't eat red meat so I always obviously get well done. It's a pain because sometimes it's too cooked. Wahlburgers cooked it to perfection. Well done and still soft and juicy!! Very friendly staff! Can't wait until the one in Chicago is open!!",5
Love the burgers here,5
"The impossible burger was good. Our waiter was really nice. If you are vegan and in Vegas you can come and order the burger. Note: Purchase it without the special sauce and no cheese. The food was all room temperature and the fries were under seasoned not awful but underwhelming. That was the only bad thing. The ambiance was cool but the chairs are awful. Whenever you move your chair there is a loud scraping noise against the floor. It was awful. At the end of out meal they took a photo of us and offered it as a memento but it had a heavy filter on it and was a little pricey. The photographer said they wanted to take the photo for social media initially. However, we did purchase  the photo.",3
I'm looking for a specialty Burger this is the place!,5
"I made 2 trips here during my stay here back in August. I went with two friends who had eaten here previously. I was skeptical thinking it might be a typical celebrity spot trading in their name. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I had the double cheeseburger both times I went there and it was excellent. So were the onion rings. It was an
11 out 10 experience. The music was a little too loud but our waiter both times was Miguel and he took care of that and everything else. Don’t miss it.",5
"Not just hype... Service was fast, absolutely great burger! Louis was singlehandedly the best employee that place could have! Thanks again for the wonderful meal and experience!",5
Great food.  Service was really good.  Prices are a little high.  Should have come with a side but all side we're separate.  Great atmosphere.  Overall I highly recommend.,4
Burger was really good. Frappe was amazing!,5
"We were so excited to try after watching the show. Burgers were great but for the price should include the fries or tots. Totally surprised to pay 105.00 for 3 people for 3 burgers 2 fries 1sweet potato tot and sodas. Would have given 5 stars if not so expensive but I guess you pay for the cups they ""give, you.",3
"I haven’t had WOW food yet in Vegas.. but this was pretty damn good! Prices are to be expected of Vegas.
We sat at the bar top and had great service!",5
Believe the hype...its that good. One of the best burgers I have had in a long time. Try the melt and get extra pickles if you like dill pickles they're made fresh daily and are too good for words. The service was fast and friendly. Definitely a do again. Ask for Diana best server ever!,5
"I didn't expect to enjoy this, but it really was good. We even went back again and we were in Vegas less than a week. The second time we got Jenny's salad, which was good, but way overdressed, so I had to ask for more arugula and it was still a bit overdressed after about doubling the arugula. Like I said though, flavors were great,just someone had way too heavy a hand with the dressing. This was a fun and decidedly cheaper place to eat with good food than many other options in Vegas.",5
"Loved my burger, the Our burger I think",5
Great location. Interior is nice and actually pretty quiet inside compared to the outside shops. Food was delicious. Came out quickly even though seats were full to at least 70%. Staff seemed super friendly and happy to answer questions. Adding this to my list of Go Tos on my future stops to Vegas!,5
"One of the best burgers my wife and I have had in a while!  Very flavorful and juicy.  Loved them tots, too!  Nice and crispy.  The service was excellent and we really enjoyed our meal.  We'll be back!",5
"Our service was excellent and the speed was great. But after taking a few bites of my burger I realized why it was fast, my burger was raw in the middle. The sweet potato tots were the best part! Overall a little underwhelming sorry to say.",4
"I really wanted to like this place but was
definitely disappointed. Ordered a “smahlburger”, although it’s plenty big. Menu states they are all cooked well done but mine was definitely way too pink in the middle so I did not eat it. The kids ordered an adult mac and cheese and a kids mac and cheese. I have never tasted blander Mac and cheese anywhere. My kid actually added salt to her adult mac and cheese.",2
It was good but it is expensive...more expensive than 5 guys but not as tasty. I do like the spiked strawberry lemonade but that's way over priced as well,3
Was not impressed. Service could have been better and food was over priced for bland burgers and a salad drowned in dressing.,1
"My husband and I loved our food and drinks! We ordered tots, the our burger with avocado spread, and caesar salad. The mud pie drink is delicious too. Service was amazing!! We’ll be back :)",5
"This place is really good, there was great people here just a little mix up but in the end it was amazing food I would come back again.",5
"I think I expected too much since I've watched a few of the shows. The staff was friendly, we got seated right away, but it took about 45 minutes to get our food. I got the Hearty, and it was okay, but nothing I would rush back for. Two others who were with me seemed to feel the same about their food, being The Beast and the Chicken sandwich. The Hearty with fries and a coke cost me 25.00. This was probably a one and done for me, but it was cool to experience I guess.",3
"Probably one of the best burgers and service I ever had! Their customer service is quick, fast, and efficient to make you feel not rushed. Price is good for Vegas. Couples should share an order of fries that's what we did!",5
"The food was good , they did leave iff some of the ingredients.  Jalapenos , tomatoes on one burger.  Onion , and pickles on another.. my daughters food came out all intact.. fried onion rings were soaked and dripping grease.. and for the price I kinda expected fries ..",4
"We ate after checking into our hotel and had been waiting to try them out.  We left very dissatisfied.  While the service was good, we can't say the same about the food.  After eating here, we went back to our hotel to chill out before we were set to leave for a show.  We never made it to the show.  I spent the rest of the day/night in the bathroom.  I was diagnosed with food poisoning.  I tried calling the next few days to no avail and no one answered the emails either.  We lost $300 because of not being able to go to the show.  We will never try another",2
"After working with Donnie for a few years as a dancer I HAD to try these burgers out. It was delicious! The burgers aren’t too big, but they are pretty filling. The fries, gator tots and onion rings are also tasty. Also the plastic green to-go cups are pretty cute",5
"It was terrible service and  2 burger fries cost us almost.$ 50.00 waited 40 min they were cold not good we were very disappointed  so sorry Mark ,Donny Paul,oh and the Son the Mom likes the Best but we won’t tell any one LOL Please get better Help kit and we love you guys🤦‍♀️🤭",1
I loved ❤ it.,5
"This was a nice stop while walking the Blvd in Vegas.  We've been twice on our vacation and the food was great, service friendly and fast.  My only complaint is both times I asked for no onions and BOTH times was handed a burger loaded with onions!",4
"Great burgers. We both had the original burger and it tasted great. Sweet potato tots were hot, fresh and tasty. Speedy too.",5
"We tried 2 different burgers. The Our Burger was on the dry side, needed more sauce. The BBQ burger was good, jalapenos were perfect. We tried fries & onion rings. They were almost better than the burgers. I'd choose fries over onion rings next time. Service was quick. Staff was very friendly. Music was too loud. The pricing is of course typical of the strip and the celebrity image. Plan on $20 per person at least. Burger, side and drink.",4
A must go every time Im in town!,5
It’s okay. Nothing special but they did let this girl take our picture for $20.,3
Amazing drinks and food,5
"Mark didn't sign my burger......kidding.
Enjoyed our visit, good food good service. Will come back to eat more food at this great place if Mark flys me back to Vegas from Australia 😁👌🤘",5
First time in the  and enjoyed it. When ordering make sure to ask them how the meat comes out. If you order medium well it is still very pink inside. the way to go  is to order they onion straws they are amazing,4
Great burgers! Cool idea with the souvenir cups. Will try to collect them from every destination with a Wahlburgers! Great food and service will definitely be back!,5
Would leave a 0 if I can. Terrible service,1
The burgers were great tastsy and satisfying. Got mine well done and my girlfriend got hers medium rare and was juicy too. And they adult drinks they had were great too not a drinker but they went done really well. And great service.,5
"Five dollar sodas, no restrooms to wash your hands, and it smelled like body odor.  Oh, and I don't think the waiter spoke much English. The burger was pretty good though.  Would recommend going once just because of the name.  Others seemed to enjoy it way more than I did.",2
"$2 burger at $20 price tag.  Doesn't come with fries (that's extra and not worth it). No clue how they justify these prices for what's basically a Denny's burger. For the same price you can get a gourmet burger at a real restaurant.  Avoid this tourist trap.

Our server Angel was amazing.",1
"Got the our burger and fries. The burger was very small and it was your average run of the mill burger. Nothing special. Not worth the price. Didn’t taste any of their sauce at all. The burger didn’t have much taste at all. The only taste I got was lettuce and pickles.
Wasn’t a big fan of the fries.  Had a odd taste and a odder after taste.",2
Delicious burgers,5
"I had a vegan burger and it was very tasty. I was with my husband, my step son, his wife, and son. Everybody ordered something different and the food came out together. Our waiter was  very attentive. This was all our first visit to Wahburgers. My husband and I have watched the show that we suggested this restaurant while in Las Vegas to the kids and the were pleasantly surprised when we came down the escalator, our great waiter, the food, the atmosphere, so much to look at. My husband and I also watch Blue Bloods, we're on season 7. We also have seen some of Mark's movies. He was on Good Morning America this morning. Thanks so much for showing a lovely family showing love for each other, your mom, and people you appreciate.",5
Great burgers :),5
Service was slow to start by then we had no problems after our order was take.  Food was amazing! The summer bacon burger had a ton of flavor and the onion rings were delicious! Highly recommend if you’re looking for a good burger.,5
"The BEST BURGERS!!! I order the Thanksgiving turkey burger because I don't eat beef. It's so delicious! I crave them.
Maybe one tiny thing, it would be nice to have more non-beef options. If I remember correctly, they have the turkey burger, a nice chicken sandwich and the impossible burger (more expensive than the beef).",5
"Food and service was great. Our food came out quickly and we didn't have to wait for seats. Sides come separate from the burger and have a good bit, so if you aren't too hungry, it's probably enough to share with a friend.",5
Seriously... In the middle of of pandemic we can't get a clean table before you seat us... We just left after realizing the table still had crumbles amd drink rings.,1
The most excellent melt I've had. Hands down. Patty cooked to order and done perfectly.onion rings are thin. Stringy rings were outstanding. Not greasy.,5
My wife and I celebrated our last anniversary. night in Las Vegas  and wanted to try the food.  The BBQ bacon and house cheeseburger  were our choices.  Both burgers were fabulous and tasted better than any  burger  we have eaten.  Price was well worth the value.  Definitely worth the price.,5
Great food. Burgers are amazing. The tator tots were very good as well. Service was great. Food was fast. Would recommend.,5
Like a kid going to Disneyland my expectations were high since watching the show and seeing they only want to give you nothing but the best I was GREATLY disappointed on how my limitless burger was made 😟 I asked medium well I got well done when I went to eat my burger it crumbled at touch! The service was GREAT just the cleanliness could be a little better. Hoping next time will be a better experience.,2
"The food was good but portions are small. Definitely get a double or triple. The bbq bacon burger was tasty. The sweet potato tots are awesome, definitely worth getting. Staff were friendly. It's packed in a Friday night.",4
Great experience at Wahlburgers. Curly fries were crunchy and fantastic along with their amazingly juicy beef burgers. I had no idea you could choose the wellness of the patties. The service was fast and it is always buzzing with customers. Well done Wahlburgs! !,5
Was pretty good. Had the burger bowl which was good but they were out of sweet potato tots and the regular fries were ok. The burgers are fabulous and the impossible burger was really good.,4
Basic vibe. Food wasn’t hot. The Our Burger patty was warm almost cold. Bacon Mac & Cheese was not good as well. Service wasn’t very friendly. Server basically dumped our food at the table and gave us the check. Prices are pretentious. I’m better off getting an In-n-Out burger for half the price. This place is a gimmick.,1
Not the same as when it first opened.,3
"Awesome!  Loved it, from the decor to the food to the amazing Strawberry shake, loved it!  We had a burger, delious without being too greasy.  Fries were just okay, also had the salad, good meat, good dressing, recommend it.  Again the shake was the best!!!  Wahlburgers is located back and off the strip but easy to find with google maps.",5
"Food and service is great, proportions are more than enough, wahlburger  adult frappé Is the best list of drinks!",5
Amazing Staff.  All smiles and super friendly.  Food was amazing.  I am celiac and William our server was very knowledgeable on Gluten Free.  Dedicated fryer FTW!  Thanks for the great experience.,5
"I ordered the impossible Burger and it was severely over priced. It didn't have a great taste either, it was $20.. For that amount I expect to be blown away. This place is one of those restaurants that feel they don't have to put in a lot of effort because of their location. You think dumb tourists are just going to pay whatever, because why?? We want to give our money away?? Think again because I will be sure not to return here unless it is for a glass of lemonade.",2
Burger was OK. Fries are not. Can say I've been to one now and won't have to go to another.,3
"The best thing about this burger, was how it was cooked.
I asked for Medium, and It came out perfect.

The problem was the burger had no seasoning.
It was bland, and they did not provide  enough of the special sauce for the burger.

They appear to cook their fries in batches, and leave them under a Food Warmer. I guess to be more efficient?
By the time they show up, they are no longer crisp.
- I will say their dipping sauces for the Fries and Tots are fantastic.

So I guess I would not say NO, if offered to me, but not something I would go out of my way for.",3
Could be better,4
"The burger... The bun was great, meat flavorless and strange texture. Onion rings are not traditional but still tasty. Fries and Tator tots are nothing special whatsoever and equivalent to what I can buy at the grocery store and make at home. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. This place only survives because of the associated name. Pricey for sure.",2
"Bacon Mack and cheese is amazing. Can't wait until they open one in Grand Rapids.

It's a very fun family restaurant or even to stop in to get a beer.",5
"Great service, great food!!! They exceeded my expectations. Everyone was friendly. Definitely will go again.",5
"Delicious burger, done right with lettuce etc. underneath the meat so that it doesn't fall apart. Friendly and attentive service. Outdoor seating requires you to listen to the music coming from the bar next door, not to everyone's taste.",4
Food was very good! Service was great. And fun atmosphere. Great location too,5
Food and drink were awesome!,5
"My son insisted...and I have to admit...the burgers are great. And the sweet potato fries are very good...

Service was very good and on top of all our needs.",4
A great burger stop on the strip. Nice location and great burgers. Everything was cooked to perfection. Service was excellent and on the spot. Great place!,5
"Place was packed to the gills when I arrived so I sat at the bar. Despite the packed restaurant, the staff was friendly and helpful with this first time customer. Food came out quick, and the Cucumber lemonade was surprisingly good. Thank you to my Bartender Christina for making this a great experience. I will definitely be back.",5
"Staff is super friendly. They really go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Oh and the food is amazing. With so many $20 burger joints in Vegas, this $10 burger is one of the best. We ate there twice yesterday.",5
Amazing food and staff was very good as well,5
BEST BURGERS EVER HANDS DOWN! NO COMPETITION!  MARK bring wahlburger to UTAH.,5
"I've never seen an impossible burger made so poorly. This was easily the thinnest patty and made way too well done, it may as well have been impossible jerky. Disgusting. Especially for $20. Service was poor, they tried to bring me the same burger when I told them it was wrong. I won't eat at Wahlburgers again.",1
"Burger was good, but Liberty Burger in Dallas is better. They tried to serve me cold onion rings and burger wasn't very hot either. By the time they served the hot onion rings, that they cooked for me, I had finished my burger. I expected better",3
"Had the Double Cheese burger and man did that taste good. Very juicy and flavourful. Added tater tots as a side and was not let down. I washed it all down with the spiked lemnoade, it all just went together perfectly. Mark if you're reading this, you did good, bro.",5
Amazing burgers....in fact the wife and I went twice in the 3 days there. Great onion rings. Fair prices. We also had friendly and very fast service. Highly recommend this place.,5
Burgers and sweet potato fries were awesome. The chicken nuggets for children were a bit dry and the onion rings were too thin and broke every time you picked one up. But still overall great and the burgers were so delicious. We walked from the hotel so not too sure about parking fees or availability. Prices were moderate.,5
Gotta say I left because of poor service a few years ago and thought I'd give it another shot. Even more disappointing and had to leave again. The place is dead on Saturday night and still couldn't get service. I can't speak to the food because I could never get served. In any case stay away from this place as two trys over a few years and aweful service in a service based industry. Can't see them in business another year!,1
Best burger that I have had in years.  Well worth the money.,5
Great place to eat,5
"We flew to Vegas, looking forward to our second time there. Last year the food & drinks were perfect! Which made me look forward to it, and I was very dissatisfied with the burger. The bun & meat were cold. I didn’t want to finish it. The employees we’re talking to much to each other, instead of focusing on kitchen & serving area.
I’ll give you one more chance. Do you have Walburgers in Texas?",3
"Neat place, but it wasnt anything overly special. You can get a better burger at a dozen places for half the price. Food was greasy as well.",2
"Save your money! Reasonable prices, my ass! 2 burgers, 1 kid's meal, 2 sides, and 2 drinks (non alcoholic) were $53.00 NOT including the tip! The food is barely a step above In 'n' Out and more than triple the price. We were very disappointed in the taste and quality of the food except for the sweet potato tots which were very good. After we saw the bill we got downright pissed and felt swindled. We will not be returning to any Wahlburgers location. Seriously folks, save your money. This mediocre food is so not worth it.",1
I try to eat at places that are not available to me near my home. The vibe was good. Burger was great. Tots didnt care for. The drink comes in a souvenir cup so that was nice. The service was great.,4
BBQ sauce is amazingly awesome!! Burgers great! Mac & cheese needs more cheese & thicker consistency. Overall experience great!!,4
"Wonderful place for a great bite to eat. Friendly staff and family friendly environment. Legit, best burgers around. Amazing tots and overall a really great place to enjoy.",5
"This place lives up to the hype. Manager, Jr is as kind and caring as they come. The service is always spot on. Its always clean and the food us a must! Do yourself a favor. Get the onion strings and a Donnie burger! Did I mention they have a full bar?",5
Burger's are super delicious. Thin Crispy Onion Rings are the best. Not traditional onion rings. The maitre d offered great service. Was quick and friendly.,4
"VERY DISAPPOINTED we went out of our way to go there. So cold inside that the wait staff were wearing hoodies and knit gloves. We had to leave our jackets on the whole time we were there. It was cold in Vegas at the time. Common sense would be close the big door of the bar to the outside. No one was out there. Food was nothing to right home about. Had to send back the onion rings the first time too cold to eat. I had the seasonal burger, never could taste the maple or butternut. .",2
My sister and I attended the Las Vegas store and we were attended to by a staff member who sat us at the front and was told she will immediately assign a server to our table and we knew exactly what we wanted and was ready to order within 5 minutes yet there was no server for 15 minutes until we had to physically get out of that chair and go in to ask who is a server because we are ready to order and that is when things turned even worse when they couldn't even take it upon themselves to take our order yet we were waiting another five to 10 minutes for the same person to come out and take our order and by the end of it we had four servers and had to physically do everything ourselves to even pay the check as we should have just walked out of there because it was absolutely deplorable so we left no tip because of the service attendants that was nonexistent but the burgers and sweet potato tots was very tasty,2
Great food love my burger tasted better then I thought a burger could taste. Only problem was didn't get exactly what I ordered. Staff was friendly and fast.,4
"I really wanted to try this place since we don't have one in Prescott, AZ. Enjoyed the burger very much!
Also loved the strawberry colada cocktail very, very much! Thank you Carlos for the great service!!",5
"Great burgers. Better than most. But the price very high for a burger. They should reduce at least $3 off of everything on the menu, then it will be totally worth it. Overall, we have a very good time there. May come back.",4
"I had the hamburger salad, my wife got the 1/3 cheeseburger and we loved it. I have eaten hamburgers all over the US and this was hands down the best tasting burgers.",5
"Quaint little place.  The food is great, our waitress was absolutley wonderful: she gave us suggestions  explained the options very well and she was fast. Super service - will definitely go back.  Even though it is on the Strip, the prices were fair - I think there wasn't anything in the menu higher than $15. Next time I'll try the frappes and the mac and cheese.",5
"Seated quickly, very friendly, food delivered quickly & hot... Paul's recipes are amazing! Even got to take our green cup with us:) We will definitely be back.",5
Best hamburger I have ever had.,5
Delicious,5
"Got seated quick, and the food came out quick as well. Our sever Blanca was great ! The food was on point! Will definitely be back with more friends",5
"Super impressed with the food but the service was even better, our server Migel was fantastic! Will be back next time I'm in Vegas! I wouldn't be upset if you opened up a location in Calgary 😉",5
"I love Wahlburgers, and the Las Vegas location doesn't dissapoint! Seems a little smaller than the locations I have been to in the Boston area, but still a great burger and a great place to eat. Seated quickly, food came quickly and staff was friendly.",5
"Holy veggie burgers, Batman! The Impossible Burger is nearly impossible to describe since it's so absolutely amazing! My carnivore husband had a bite & said he'd eat the whole thing without question. The whole restaurant and food is wonderful and totally worth the wait for a table!! 12 out of 10 would recommend.",5
"Very disappointed.  Started off with really bad hosting.  Wait staff was good.  Food was ok.  The place was dirty and sticky.  Walking out,  i felt like i was at a state fair for a week.  Only reason i gave it a star was for the wait staff.  Do better,  go to shake shack or steak and shake,  they're much better.",1
Great food,5
Great food. Very clean and staff  were amazing. They even switched where we we going to sit because they realized one of our party members wouldn't fit past the one of the tables because she gas a Walker so they just said that the section was closed instead of embarrassing her.,5
"One of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  I really like the thin onion rings.  I like them with the wahl sauce.  The drinks are a little pricey but on par for Vegas but they were awesome.
The pickles are the best, made in house!",5
"As a New England guy you probably think I’m just saying this.... BUT NO!!! BEST BURGER JOINT ANYWHERE. I travel a lot and even when I’m home in Boston I will go to both locations at least once, Vegas location was just as good as the rest. Amazing every time!",5
Got the OUR BURGER!!! Came with the government cheese they all talk about. Man was it GREAT! I truly enjoyed the burger the shake and the beer. Loved the restaurant will definitely be making this a regular stop.,5
"It was ok.. a burgers a burger I guess. If Im being completely honest, Denny's has better burgers for sure. But wanted to show love to the whalbergs lol",3
"My first time ever in Vegas and I couldn't wait to eat here. I was so disappointed! My family and I all order our burgers medium well to medium done and the whole order was wrong. Meat was under cooked! The sides and mac and cheese were great. I just wish the burgers were made to our liking. After traveling more than 8 hrs, you're very hungry so we ate. The atmosphere inside was great & I loved the way they displayed everything Wahlburg related. Down side was that the music playing was so loud that it was hard to have a conversation with family and that could have very well been the reason why our order was wrong, because the waiter couldn't hear us! If I ever make it to the strip again I'll   definitely give it another shot!",4
"Nice staff, good service, cool environment but this is just too expensive. Walk a little bit further and go to in and out. You can get a great quality burger at less then half of what you pay here. Personally I'd do in and out over this and if I wanted a gourmet burger I'd go to Ramsey's.",2
The food was amazing. I also loved that they were playing the Wahlburgers during the meal so you could see the amazing men outside of the movie roles. Maybe it was just a bad night but I was more than less impressed by the service. I only gave so many stars because the food was amazing. I hope they know what kind of people work at the bar. I've been happy with service my whole time in Vegas and was excited about this place but the service was the worse out of all the places we've gone in a week.,3
Love this place. Food was great. Portions were enough for two people to share.  Thanks guys. Staff was on their A game tonight.,5
"Onion rings were great, burgers were delicious. I appreciated the crunchy green leaf lettuce and fresh tomatoes; every bite was crispy and meaty. A bit pricey but this is Vegas; you could get a lot less for even more money... I think it was worth it.",5
"Great food and atmosphere. Family oriented, even modest dress for Vegas. Waitress was attentive and helpfull and sweet. I would highly recommend this place.",5
1st time. Onion rings are amazing. Had to send burger back. My fault not familiar with how to order burger doneness. Server Pedro was a true professional. Burger was perfect when I got it back.,4
Nice burger selection.good beer selection,5
Great Service!!!The waiters was very attentive and pro actively responded to our needs before we could gather up our thoughts to figure out what we actually needed. Music and atmosphere gives off a sports bar feel but it is definitely a family oriented place. Walls and ceilings are filled with memorabilia from former movies and music ventures from all 3 brothers which gives this place a more personal relationship from the Wahlburg brothers to the customer. A must go place to be added to your bucket list.,5
Alexandria was our server and did an amazing job. Great food. Good service. Good beers. Would absolutely come here again!,4
"A friend and I walked up to the hostess and was told to wait at a bench across from her. Within 3 minutes 3 other pairs of 2 walked up and immediately seated to the bar. Both of us are 27. Absolutely no mention of open bar seating. When I went up to complain, a table occupied and we were seated immediately. A server came and asked us for our drinks. Thankfully they came in to-go cups because enough time had passed where some other people asked to see our menus since they were waiting so long! We just got up and left. This is during 1:30PM on a Sunday. Avoid this place during this time and maybe you'll have a better experience than my friend and I.",1
"Way overrated and not worth the price. We stopped in after the hockey game and sat at the bar. Got two burgers, a ceasar salad, and two beers. The total bill was $60!!!!! Our fault for not looking at the prices more closely. We could have gotten better food at In N’ Out. The burger was salty and had barely anything to it. The salad was just bad. The lettuce was fresh but there was almost no dressing or taste to the dressing. I’m so disappointed and will definitely steer friends away from going here.",2
"The service was exceptional even though they were packed! The drinks were excellent and oh my, the burgers were beyond amazing! Can't wait to go again.",5
Awesome burgers and service. A+++,5
"I paid the place a visit after hearing so much hype about Wahlburgers.  When I first passed by around mid-afternoon I was surprised at the long line of customers waiting seating.  It was already after 2PM.  So I gave up and continued walking on the Vegas strip.  I came back later  (after 4 PM) and found no line.  I sat at the bar.  There was great ambiance or as the Germans are fond of saying, it has gemuetlichkeit!

IT was not too noisy.  There were plenty of television screens with different sport events playing.  So for sports fans, it may be a nice destination.  The burger was actually quite tasty.  I was skeptical when I initially ordered but pleasantly surprised at the burger.  I bought a beer glass and enjoyed my time.

They have a small annex outside, directly on the strip where you can get food to go or buy things like t-shirts.  All in all it was a pleasant experience.  I'll go to another Wahlburgers if I get the chance.  Enjoy!",4
Nice place. The BBQ Bacon burger is really worth stopping by! I wish we could have Wahlburgers in Canada!,5
"My lover was completely drunk told me he’s gonna go get pizza to bring back to hotel room he got lost 😂😂 I was also drunk went to go find him!

It was a little after 1 AM and I know we need good food in our liquor filled stomach I was thrilled to see that Wahlburgers stays open til so we ditched the pizza and went there.

The host and the server put up with my lover bad funny jokes and played along and made the experience far more fun and enjoyable it was good feel all around! I highly recommend this place the people really clearly loved there jobs and it radiates to the customers like me.

Thank you for making one of the nights in Vegas the best date night ever!

The burgers was perfect! I loved the house sauce with my fries!

Prices is a bit steep though",5
"A sold-out fan of Wahlburgers, I finally reached the Valhalla that is the Las Vegas Wahlburgers.  The temp outside was about 109° and the Vegas Wahlburgers was like a desert oasis. As soon as we were seated, our server, Jake, came to our table with ice cold water already in hand for each one of us. In my usual style, I tipped in advance. Jake was already scoring high marks with his anticipation of what we'd need as we were seated. The tip put this man into overdrive. For the rest of the meal, we couldn't put a fork down or use a napkin without Jake whisking it away and refreshing our drinks like a boss. Our meals were served promptly and were, as expected, magnificent. The tots and onion straws were piping hot, crispy and delicious. We ALWAYS order more Wahlsauce. It's the piece de resistance. Do NOT miss the Wahlsauce! We had the Triple Decker, the Crispy Haddock, the BBQ Bacon and the Wahlbowl. Each was devine. The crispy haddock stole the show. Crispy Panko encrusted haddock that was fried to flaky perfection. As I bit into the sandwich, the combination of flavors were delicately superb. Nothing was overwhelming. I shared this with my wife so I could save room for my Wahlbowl. Essentially, a Wahlbowl is a salad with a hamburger and the fixings placed on top. It worked perfectly. The dressing was tangy and sweet and the inclusion of the Wahlburger proprietary beef-blend patty mad for a stout protein to offset the greens. As a bonus, there was bacon! The smokey, crunchy flavor permeated each bite and took me to a taste Nirvana the likes I have never known. It was decadent. As we cashed out i was slightly upset with the fact that they included automatic gratuity. I understand the concept, i just feel that it should be up to me. All in all,it was incredible. If you're in Vegas and you want a great burger, try Wahlburgers!",5
"The burger was great, the waitress was awesome! But for such a popular restaurant, I expected more. It didn't have much to it really - more like a diner. And they didn't have the souvenir items available as requested, so that was kind of a bummer.",3
The burgers and fries were amazing and they have a nice selection of cocktails. The meal was a little on the pricey side but for Vegas it's one of the more aforaffordable places. Would definitely recommend this place! They also have a killer new kids on the block poster :),5
"This brotherly chain of burger joints actually has some pretty good food considering the kitsch factor. Right off the strip, it's a convenient place for a quick bite or a late night snack. The burgers have a bunch of different style choices and are cooked well with a nice juicy flavor. The beer selection is pretty good as well with some local craft brews.",4
Food was good. First time trying it out here in Vegas. Service was fast and pleasant,5
This place sucks way over priced go to in & out burger is way better and cheaper I would never recommend this place😂😂😂😂😂😂,1
Good hamburgers and  cold sodas. Friendly staff and decent prices make this a good stop on the strip. One of the cheaper places to grab a bite to eat.,4
"I was craving a burger and had heard that Wahlburger was good. The burger I had didn't disappoint.  I had the BBQ Bacon burger. It was a nice hearty patty, juicy and tasty. My only comment is that the light in there is super bright white to the extent of being sterile (like a hospital) and the music was kinda out of control. So the environment felt a little off. But the burger was good!",4
Good tasting burgers,5
"Best  Hamburger I have ever had!  I have been all over the US and World and their regular burger PLAIN with cheese  and small onion rings was just delicious.   I had it two nights in a row.  With out all the added products you get the true taste of the meat and it was superb!  Service at the bar was not great but the food is the Star here.  Can't wait for their opening in Houston,TX.",5
Came here on my birthday on the 1st of July and it was amazing due to there being literarily nobody on the strip so the service was great and food even better!!,5
"Onion rings were good. Bun was not that great. And burger was ok at best. One of those ""tried it won't be back"" moments.",3
Super bummed last year was great this time was worse than McDonald's.  Burgers came cold and toppings all-over the place and a tiny bit of sauce,2
"I'm coming back to finish this review, but this is our new favorite Vegas restaurant!!! It is fantastic and the service is wonderful! We're in love!!",4
Hard to find ..,4
Excellent food. Handmade hamburgers like mom makes. Friendly and great service. Great atmosphere. Clean. Would definitely return and recommend.,5
"The flavoring of the burgers are amazing. My Patty Melt, actually melted on my mouth. The service was nice. They told us it would be an hour wait but we were called in 20min. If you are in Las Vegas you must come here just to say you came here its really good. Love it..",5
I go here everytime I visit Vegas . Very pricey . No meals you buy everything separate.  So like 20  for a burger and fries . I was a bit made after paying that much but when I ate it ..it was well worth it.  The bacon mac and cheese is out of the world and their pickles are the best I ever had .,4
"This joint never disappoints!! The Angus burgers are amazing, the flavors are awesome, tasty and juicy. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a gourmet burger at a decent price.",5
Busy location.  Sat at the bar instead of waiting for a table. The bartender took our order quickly and the food was brought out quickly! Order came exactly as we requested.  Burger was great and I loved the sweet potato tots! Staff was friendly and smiling.  Great food on the strip!,5
"My husband and I both have food allergies, barley and rice for him, dairy for me, which can make eating out difficult. Not only was Wahlburgers able to accommodate our food issues our waitress was understanding and helpful. The quality of the food was great. Everything was delicious!",5
"When I say it's delicious...I mean DELICIOUS!  Honestly, I went in with low expectations but these burgers were fabulous. Hubby and I both ordered the Supermelt. The burgers came out fast and hot. The meat was seasoned and perfectly portioned. The overall burger was top notch. Definitely one of my top burgers. I didnt even have to dress this burger up. The fries were tasty. Hubby got sweet potato tots and they were good as well. I will be returning and highly recommend this place.",5
"The burgers were delicious. Honestly, we went in expecting overpriced and overhyped food, but my goodness the food was cooked perfectly. They are filling and full of flavor. The staff also took my egg allergy into consideration and ensured I didn't eat the wrong bread or sauce, which is a major plus.",5
"First time at a Wahlburgers and it was delicious! Juicy and not greasy. Wish I had one in my hometown in Sarasota, FL. Best BBQ ""Donnie"" burger.",5
"The food was amazing! Sweet potatoe tots are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside - very flavorful. The BBQ Bacon Bowl was to die for. Meat was cooked to order and Paul's special sauce was incredible! Would recommend.",5
Great burgers great service,4
Great fodd. Great service. Very fast getting our food even though the place was full.,5
The overall male was enjoyable. The bun was really great. The staff was fantastic and wasn't bothersome but did assured that my needs were taking care of.,5
Absolutely overpriced. The burgers were so thin that was impossible to taste the meat. Same quality as in and out burgers,1
"Amazing service, faaaaaaast!! Food was perfect!!",5
"The food was good. Portions aren't huge but I kind of liked that because you leave feeling content, not sick from overeating. I tried the Thanksgiving Turkey Burger per Mark's stamp of approval and it was super tasty. If you crush on Mark Wahlberg, this place has pics of him all over so it's a gorgeous atmosphere if you ask me.  ;) Someone comes around and takes pics of you that they try to sell to you as souvenirs. That isn't my favorite but they do give your group 1 free 4×6 regardless of if you buy any other shots so that's cool. It's not a place I would frequent if there was one in my town but I would go here again while on vacation.",4
"Ate at Wahlburgers last night. So, so good. Perfect amount of food. A bit pricey but it's Vegas. I will go back. The onion rings are amazing. The ranch dressing was nasty. Everything else was great.",5
"pretty good Burger, OK Fries and nice and friendly service. But you should really consider to change your plastic wrapping...

thx
Phil",4
"Great welcoming experience. Best burger ever. Wait staff friendly, engaging and knowledgeable.
G
Excellent service.",5
"I don't get what why all the hype.  Maybe the Vegas one just doesn't have the same quality as others?  Everything was fine, I guess.  But there are so many places to get amazing burgers in Vegas, this was just average.",2
Enjoyed this place.  The food was good.  It was sort of an inside outside type of location.  Nice staff members.,5
Burger was really good but pricey.  Probably because it's Vegas.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Definitely recommend stopping in and giving it a try.  You won't be disappointed.,5
"THE OUR BURGER - Terrific; If you want to know what ""homemade"" hamburgers taste like, but delicious, this is it. Don't lie. I'm going to say that this is one of the best burgers I've ever had - only because I'm trying to think of others; honestly, it probably very much is.

THANKSGIVING DAY SANDWICH - Delicious; If there were to be a ""modern"" Monte Cristo, this would be it. Eating two is not out of the question.

BBQ BACON - This one will sneak up on you, fill you up, and have you wondering why you ordered two sandwiches. Pro tip: Slide a few onion rings on there - but again, beware the first rule.

JENN’S CHICKEN SANDWICH - This really is the best chicken sandwich I've had; it's put together perfectly, and the flavor of it all together is something you must try. This is proof that you don't need chicken to be deep fried or spicy in order for it to be put on a sandwich.

Yukon Gold Fries - However McDonald's makes their fries, they figured out a way to do it much - much - better, in every way. It's quite interesting, and a must try.

Tater Tots - I'm not gonna lie: these are tater tots - except you don't have to worry about them being poorly cooked - which, if we're all being honest, is the biggest problem with Tater Tots, and the reason why we all stopped eating them post-schooling.

Thin Crispy Onion Rings - Like the fries, these are as fascinating as they are delicious. Very light batter, thinly sliced onions. Forget how delicious they are, I'd like to see how they prepare them and handle them without, well, making a mess. Try it for yourself, or Google it, you'll see what I mean.",5
"Great burger, pretty standard Vegas prices. Carry out is available. The frozen drinks are super sugary, so if you’re not big on sweet, don’t get the Blue Pina flavor.",5
Very good food and nice atmosphere. Prices are very reasonable as well. Would go again if I am near one in the future.,5
"Disappointed!  While the food was good, I was expecting more.  For the price and all the hype, it wasn't great.  I had ""The Our Burger"" and fries.  If there's anything special about their sauce, I couldn't tell because there was hardly any there.  The burger was good, but no better than what I can get at a Steak-N-Shake.  The fries were nothing special either and were typical of many other steak houses.  My wife had the ""Mom's Sloppy Joe"".  We both liked it.  I liked the way it was put together, but as far as the Sloppy Joe goes, it was nothing special.  You can find a better recipe online.  If I'm going to pay 4x the norm, I expect greatness and this wasn't it.",3
Call it Blhandburgers instead. Overpriced burger is seasoned with only salt and pepper and tastes as bland as Primeburgers! If you are like me and like flavor in your burger and your from out of town I highly suggest Millers Ale House at Town Plaza. They have the best prime rib burger with tons of flavor! But if you're into bland food you'll enjoy Wahlburgers as they wont disappoint!,1
"During my extremely tight, layover, I decided to try Wahlburgers for the first time here. After a very quick sit down, I was immediately greeted and offered drinks from their stations and such. (Note that if you don't want to sit down, eat and pay for tip; Wahlburgers has options to take out and eat elsewhere. Almost like Five Guys)

Their menu was something to be quite lacking for me. Options contained their signature burgers, Chicken Sandwiches, Hot Dogs, etc.

While I did order their signature burger, their French fries, I found out to be optional and were charging quite an exuberant amount for. Since this being my first time, I ordered it anyway.

When it came to presentation, it came in a line production style with Wahlburgers' wrapping and insignias. For the $20 dollars I paid for (just myself, no drink) I expected a little more.

If you are having a layover, would I recommend this place? No way, if you want your money's worth, head over to each hotel and check out their buffet options. If you are looking for a nice lunch during football season, this place is the right place to be.",4
Average at best. Nothing special about the burgers except the price (too high). The people that eat here are doing it only because of name recognition and nothing more. Staff was good.,2
"The burgers are small and very pricey but tasty. The mac n cheese was a nice size portion for the price and taste was on point. Wished the sides were not extra, that was a let down.",3
"One of the best places to eat in Las Vegas. The food was amazing, and reasonably priced for Vegas standards. Diners are gifted with a commemorative postcard which comes with an upsell opportunity but it wasn't too pushy. I recommend the double burger with some of their onion strings.",5
"Was here last year for lunch while walking the strip. The food is OK, nothing that blew me away, surprised me with how good it was, or excited me. Just your standard real hamburger. Which would be enough to get a good review from me except it's so damn expensive. Pass.",2
"We were super excited to go to Wahlburgers during our trip to Vegas.  We were fully aware of the premium prices for the burgers And expected both the service and quality of product would reflect such.
The fries were cold and the pasta and cheese was flavourless and dry.  I ordered a one patty burger med rare and One of our party ordered a double medium rare.  Mine was perfect.  The other was well done but oddly the bottom of the bun was literally frozen.  When the server came by and asked how everything was, we showed him the well done burger.  He said..that was ordered med rare...I’ll have them remake it.  Then a manager came over and said “we’re remaking the burger”.

So the rest of us ate our meals and they brought the second double burger over.  It was caked on with so many jalapeños that they had to be scraped off...and the burger was well done again!  Server came by to see how it was and we showed him and he said “I can have them recook it”. We were ready to leave as we didn’t want to wait another 20 minutes for a third try.  The burger was reluctantly consumed as the party didn’t want to seem unappreciative of being taken out to dinner.
My guests left the table to wait outside when I was presented with the US $115 bill. 4 burgers, 2 shakes, 2 pops, 3 fries and pasta with cheese.
I mentioned to the server I was surprised to see the overcooked burger on the bill. He brought the manager over who said “sweetie, he ate it.  We offered to cook it again and he said no”.
After a bit of chatter she reduced the bill by $5.

To clarify, I knew this dinner would cost upwards of $100 and I would have been satisfied had the one burger been comped.  It was not what was ordered twice and was consumed reluctantly.

I can go on about food industry standards, quality control and customer service but, I’ve said enough. I would NEVER go back to this restaurant at any locations and will be posting a review on google, yelp and trip advisor.

I’m sure poor service and food quality wasn’t the intention of the Wahlberg family when they decided to set up a “family franchise”  but we were all very very disappointed.",1
By far the best burger EVER!!!!,5
I had The Beast with a side of tater tots. One of the best burgers that I've ever had. All the flavors came together beautifully.  The wait wasn't long and the staff was great! Next time I'm in Vegas I will be back!,5
Never disappoints! Their food is great and the people have always been friendly. Everytime we are in Vegas Wahlburgers is a must!,5
"The food was very good. Asked for my burger medium well, was cooked perfectly.  The staff was excellent and very friendly. Didn't understand the wait time for a table for two though.. Spoke with the Mgr and he was very receptive to the feedback. Will see if issue has been addressed  the next time we go.",4
Decent prices for the strip.  About what I expected as far as the food.  An above average burger. Onion rings were good.  I wanted to try there beer the wahlbruski but they were out which was a bummer. It’s all about the name but it’s worth a trip to say you have been.,3
Burgers great only thing I asked for my burger well done... and that was not the case... sweet potato tats great and crispy onion rings great..  love the post card I got also!,4
Great food. More food than anyone in our party could finish. Excellent service!,5
Love this place great service great food!,5
It was alright Burger but in my opinion it was too much for the price. Everything was individually priced from the Burger to the fries.  I felt like I was paying for the name not the Burger. There was one positive about the experience the service was great and the staff was friendly.,2
Great place to eat,5
I'm a huge burger lover and this place does not come close to good taste or quality. These burgers are on PAR with a low budget burger place. A McDonald's qtr pounder has more flavor. However it's a fun and inviting place with great cocktails the string onion rings are awesome too. I would come back but only for drinks defiantly not a burger joint for burger snobs.,3
First time wahlburger customer.... SUPER SATISFIED. The service was mediocre but the burger was excellent. Had the double with no onion no tomatoes and added bacon. Best burger I’ve had in a very very long time.. wish Mark was visiting at the time but maybe next time 😍 PS.. I bought the picture,5
Good burger and fries,5
Delicious! So glad I finally got to try it. Went with the our burger and was very happy with that choice!,5
"LOVE THEIR BURGERS!!! I have been here many times and each time I have tried a different burger and quite honestly, I love them all! Their staff is great and the service is pretty fast. Get there early, especially on the weekend as the wait is long, but worth it.",5
"Very good food. Well portioned, well cooked, well well seasoned, onion rings were to die for.. prices good.. we will be back..",5
Great food and service.,5
"Absolutely the best burger I ever had!!!! Traveled from baltimore and this was one of my spots I just had to try... Alexandria ""Alex"" was very attentive, kind and kept a beautiful smile. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE ALEX!!!",5
"Great tasting burger and the sweet potato tots are very tasty. It's not cheap food, but it's good food.

If the photographer comes around to take your photo, just say no. Or they'll just come back around and try and sell you that photo.",4
"Food was delicious, quality ingredients. Only thing I didn’t like was that your sandwich didn’t come with a side, and the sides were a bit more than I felt like they should be. But part of it is the novelty. Will definitely a going again.",4
"Food was fabulous and served very friendly. There was a small blunder with a shake, but they corrected it amicably and quickly. The onion rings were much lighter and tastier than any I have had before and the fries were thick cut and wonderful. It is cold in the restaurant, but well worth it.",5
Best burger. Ever.,5
While the food smelled delicious my sloppy Joe sandwich was mediocre.  My sloppy Joe meat was under seasoned and the bread was overly buttered. The fries and onion rings were delicious.  I guess I expected better from a celebrity restaurant. Also my order was originally delivered incorrectly and I got the incorrect bill.  It was all corrected however just wanted to point it out.,3
"Had a Breakfast Burger with Egg over easy just last Saturday. This was my last meal in town before we left.
And I can say one thing. This was great start for our day ! Wahlburgers came exactly the way we ordered them. My Rare was fantastic. We came early and place started to fill very quickly ...Just great experience.Price are reasonable too. Go and try.",5
"Wonderful staff, and excellent food. Very reasonably priced for the area and the large portions. Better to get there before you are hungry because there is always a line, but for a small group you can get in on a reasonable amount of time. They do a little gimmicky photo souvenir that's mildly annoying, but they don't pressure you into buying anything you don't want. Highly recommend the fries!",5
I love wahlburgers. I always have to eat here at least one time on my trips to Vegas. Our burger is my favorite. The margaritas are out of this world good.,5
"Great experience. Our server Evelio was outstanding. Knew the menu.  We couldn’t decide between fries or rings, he split the basket. Burger was great. Giving it a 4 cuz Ramsay cheese burger was best and Irvine’s was better as well. Tough competition.",4
Great service. Food was good. Mac and cheese was dry at first However we let them know and they brought us a fresh order without hesitation.,4
We stopped here after a show at The Flamingo. Really enjoyed it. Great burgers and fun place.,5
"This place is fast food plain and simple. Not worth the money.

Hype is not worth the basic burger.",2
This place was shockingly good. There are plenty of options and they have a full bar. You can sit and eat or get your order to go. Fuel Bar right next door has great drinks and will let you eat there.,4
"I have been to a few different Wahlburgers, but Vegas was my first and is ALWAYS consistently amazing! Alma's Mac Salad and the Mac n cheese is just so delicious there are just no words.. visit Wahlburgers Vegas today! 💚💚💚",5
Doesn't have nfl Sunday ticket.  Plays same game on TVs right next to each other.,1
Delicious! Alexandria was an excellent waitress! The food was excellent we will definitely be back it did not disappoint! My husband loved the Thanksgiving burger I enjoyed the Our burger. Yum!,5
"It was pretty good. The burgers were decent, but a little over priced. I ordered from the kids menu because I wasn't too hungry and it was pretty good.",4
"Good burger but don't expect to get your money's worth.  Burger comes with NO fries or any sides...  And they are not cheap!   However, the service was good and fast.",1
Went to the Vegas Wahlburgers it was so good! We had the burger & fries! You can not bring in outside drinks though so don't order the $42 huge drink that I ordered & expect to take it in! :( Prices are very reasonable though.,5
"Awesome food, staff was great and always available. Everything ordered was delicious: salad, burgers, chili, mac and cheese, drinks. Definitely a great move",5
"Service was excellent, the fries were good but the burger was very disappointing! The meat was disgusting...granted it was a turkey burger, I expected it to at least be edible🤮",1
The food was delicious. Fast and friendly service. The price was higher than I am use to but I imagine common for the area. Would recommend and will return.,5
"I definitely didn’t get a good vibrations with place. Burgers tasted like it was straight frozen, not fresh. Jack in a box is better than this. Not work the money!",1
The BEST food we've had in Vegas so far! The original melt was amazing and the service was very fast and friendly! Will definitely be returning.,5
The burger's are ok the tater tots came out cold. The mac n cheese was excellent it's the only thing that came out hot. They give you a green Wahlburgers  cup to keep they will fill it anytime you go back there. But I  was not impressed with them at all.  They  give it to much hype on the  show.,2
The burger was done to perfection!! Staff were so sweet and accommodating. The only thing i can complain about were the onion rings. Wish they were real rings. Not straws.,4
Overall good burgers but expect to pay over 13 for one. Does not come with a side. If you want fries you pay 5 dollars more. You'd think the fries would be amazing... Sadly this is not true. If you don't mind paying out the ass it's a decent burger but I think you're better off going somewhere else. I rated 4 stars because the quality of food was good.,4
"Had such high expectations, they need a better cook and service not good either. You guys need to clean house already! All ingredients were delicious they  need to not over cook the food and be friendlier! Maybe it'll be better next time I will give it one more shot, love you boys!",2
"I have eaten in Boston and Orlando at these franchises, I expect to pay more as in Vegas but to drop the quality to below average is a disrespect to the brand.  Awful food where as the others I visit regularly are lovely. Owners take a look please.",2
Waited over an hour for my order.  The waiter looked like he was in rehab and was a no-show after the order. Payed my $10 for 2 sodas and left.,1
"Good burger joint, prices reasonable compared to most places in Las Vegas. Cool decorations. Staff was friendly.",5
"Money grab!
Cheap food at an astronomical price! I hope Albertsons is giving u crooks a deal on ur frozen burgers!",2
The food was delicious I love the Thanksgiving day sandwich is great and the  sweet potatoes tots are to die for. My husband had the triple decker burger w Bacon he loved it. I hope I can come again and try more food.,5
"This past weekend was our first trip to Vegas and also to Wahlburgers. Needless to say, we ate there 3 times. Great food, good prices and really friendly staff. Everyone there loves their job and it really shows. We can't wait to come back!",5
"Burger was pretty damned good.
Plenty of tater tots.
Enjoyed the belching beaver peanut butter beer",4
"Great food, but legend has it that I'm still waiting for my check...",4
"The food was DELICIOUS. First time coming to Vegas, and eating at Wahlburgers. Sweet potato tots were awesome as well I loved it!",5
"Super good burgers, toppings are great however the lettuce was a bit on the wet side causing the bottom bun to become soggy then fall apart. Otherwise food was great. Decent sized drink menu, which felt a bit overpriced.",5
"This establishment has the best burgers ever. The food is amazing,  the staff are friendly and so attentive, and the atmosphere is wonderful. Highly recommended to stop buy for a quick bite. Definitely get your money's worth here that's for sure.",5
Great food. A little hard to find - it's behind all the bars/other buildings. You get to keep your cup!!,5
Poor Wahlburgers serving fast food in the strip.  Better food at their more established restraints.  Skip this one.,1
"The burger was exactly what I wanted, clean fresh lettuce and tomato, tasty beef and good crisp fries. It had a brioche style bun which personally I'm not a great fan of but very happy otherwise.",5
"Good big burger, I had the our burger, it was bomb! Great atmosphere cool cutouts of the guys for selfie s. Didn't get sides, was walking strip.",5
"Highly disagree with most of these reviews. First, it's a celebrity food chain you should expect to wait to get a table. Second, a burger in Vegas any where is going to cost you about $10 dollars. The burgers were large in size and tasted wonderfully! Nice and juicy, Paul's secret sauce was delicious! We were seated immediately and had drinks at our table within minutes followed by a quick delivery of food!!! Tator tots were a bit cold like others have said but everything else was great. Highly recommend trying it out! We orders the ""Our Burger"" and it was delicious!!!!!!!",4
"Best burger ever, I had the O.F.D and it was awesome. The staff was great, very friendly. The sweet potato fries are great and onion rings are the best.  If you have not tried them you really need too. You will not regret it!!!",5
"Came here with co-workers while in town for CES 2018. Server was energetic and friendly, the service was great all around, and the burger was awesome! Well done!",5
Wasn’t a fan of the thin sliced onion rings or sweet potatoes but hammer just ok . Not great but Not Bad and it is an option for late night . I bet more beer or alcohol in me it would of been better.,3
"Ordered my burger med. well. It came out med. rare, probably should have sent it back but didn't. Stomach problems all night. I never have stomach problems. Not so sure they are using the best prime Chuck.... Beware",3
My boyfriend and I went to walhburgers tonight for burgers and fries. It took a few minutes for someone to seat us and then no one waited on us. We left with a bad taste in our mouths about the place. They seemed pretty busy but they had way too many people working to not get any service. The only reason I would give it a 1star is due to the delicious smell coming from the restaurant.,1
"My respect for their wonderful greetings, service, and delicious food. It's been the best burgers & potato totes I've ever tried. I loved the place!",5
Awesome and very tasty place extremely friendly atmosphere,5
"The burgers tasted like a regular burger. I got ""The Our Burger"" with Swiss cheese. I also got the onion rings. Those little beauties bumped this review up to 4 stars.  I would go back just for the onion rings.  They had a great texture and flavor.",4
"Burgers were good. Service was great. Is the Wahlburger all it's cracked up to be? Not really. It's touristy, an above average burger at best. But there is an ambience about the place that makes you feel like you're getting something special. Definitely worth at least one visit.",4
"Meal came out a little pink.  We thought it was not done enough,  but it turned out we didn't know their version of medium.  Totally our fault and they still made it right!!! Phenomenal!!!  And the food is amazing!!!",5
"Your location is terrible, almost sleazy feeling to it.  I was disappointed in this.  The music was so loud you could barely have a conversation.
Your burgers were awesome, beat out Bobby Flay's Burger Palace.  Your onion straws were excellent.  We also ordered a malt, chocolate mint.  Tasted like chemicals, had to send it back.  Too much for such a tiny malt, Bobby's got you beat on that.  Tots are no big deal, anyone can make these.  Won't be back to this location since it feels so dirty.",2
GREAT FOOD AND GREAT DRINKS,5
"Yummy food, mac n cheese great, burger perfect, fries cold..should of sent back.  Drinks served in plastic cups to go, nice.. but not good for environment.  Pay a dishwasher Family !!",5
"Amazing place. Paul and and staff treated us so great. We have a service dog and they sat us in a comfortable place with water for our service dog.

They truly represent the brand well. Thank you Paul.",5
The lady at the podium was awesome. I think her name was Hope. She was very bubbly and helped us to pick our burgers. A1+ service.,5
"Super friendly, clean and delicious",4
Great food,5
Burger was great! I liked that all drinks came with a souvenir cup. Service was fast.,4
"The burger was barely better than a Jack in the Box burger, and not nearly as good as Red Robin.  For all the hype it should at least be as good as Red Robin. Essentially it's an over-hyped, over-priced fast food experience.",1
"What a place!!!! The burgers are creative, the meat does not taste like it's been frozen. We tried the Thanksgiving burger which blew our minds. I would also recommend trying the house beer",5
The food and service here are very good. Not the best burger I have ever had but it has been very good both times I have been. A very good option for a good meal on the strip.,4
The prices are high for what you get. Drove 4 hours to come here and I could have stayed home and went to Hard rock for less money and to have a restroom for customers. My son had to leave the restaurant and go around the building to go to the bathroom. For a family business would you Alma want your grand kids walking out of a business to go to the bathroom. I am guessing not.,3
"Service is wonderful. Ambience, the place is so alive!   I ordered the bbq bacon burger and onion string it is the bomb. When i first saw the burger it is smaller than i expected. And i was expecting free refill fountain drinks, but i got a bottle of rootbeer. Other than that for the the food taste great. I will definitely dine-in there again.",4
Stopped in for a drink had great waitress from  Ireland. Great music and was very busy place. Food looked good but will have too wait till next visit. Cheers.,5
"Food was good but we found the picture gimmick  (hey, we take your picture and give it to you for free, then try to sell more) a little beneath what we expected from Wahlburgers. Also, purchased an iced tea that came in a souviner hard plastic cup, but it came with a disposable cheap coffee stand lid and straw.  We ate outside and were surprised to see how dirty the wall was. Waitress was not very friendly either. Greeted us, took our order, served us, not one smile or friendly word at all. Was super excited to go there, but overall pretty disappointed",3
"Good food, friendly staff and good service. They have gluten free bun options.",4
"My husband and I are from Georgia. I grew up loving NKOTB and Marky Mark. And my 18 yr old begged us to go eat here because she a huge fan of both too. Let me say the food was amazing!!! The service was amazing. The only 2 things I would rant about is I ordered the basket of Onion Rings and got half frys half ORings...bartender didnt offer to make it right..just said oh! Okay yall get to try
both then....well I didn't want both...I wanted ORings only...lol...and my husband's burger was cook medium well like mine and he wanted well done. So I said that to say this.$39.00 bill for 2. Those 2 simple things should've been a breeze to do...overall i would recommend this place and food to anyone!!! Great food...great burger...just like down in the South!!!!",4
"This place is fantastic.  Some of the best customer service I have recieved in any restaurant and it is a ""burger joint"".  The burgers are excellent...the strawberry margarita was delicious.",5
"Best burger I have ever had!! Excellent service and affordable pricing! Don't forget to have some onion rings, they are delicious!",5
Little bit of a wait. Good burger. Little expensive for me but I am from the middle of nowhere NC. What do I know.,5
Finally was able to go here in Vegas! Burgers and sweet potatoes are the BOMB! Lets not forget that mac n cheese!,5
"It's okay, overrated.",3
"We received great service however the food was terrible.  There were 5 people in our party, 3 ordered hamburgers, 1 persons bun was so hard you'd break a tooth trying to eat.  The sloppy Joe's were awful..
mac and cheese tasted like canned cheese.   Overpriced and very disappointing.",1
"Nothing exciting or exceptionally amazing about the burger if you're getting it in a salad which was just mediocre at best, nothing special. If you have food allergies, be careful with your order. The waiter also forgot my added sides, which he brought towards the end of my meal. It was a busy night, so it was tough to get his attention.",2
"The atmosphere of the restaurant was really cool and what staff we saw looked friendly. While waiting for our take out food, I noticed a lot of plates coming back to the kitchen due to the order not being correct. It was almost comical to find out that my order was also wrong once I got back to the hotel....but what ever burger it was I got, it was great although the fries were cold. Kept it a 4 stars because I loved the special sauce used on the burgers.",4
"Medium rare? Yes please. Tater tots are glorious here (!!) and it brings back my childhood. The burgers are super savory and just the right amount of spice. Short wait on a busy Saturday night. Good service. An amazing gourmet burger, and hands-down my new favorite burger joint. Would recommend.",5
"Overpriced and overhyped food. I wouldn’t waste your money here when there are so many other great burger joints to chose from instead. 2 burgers, 2 fries, and drinks for over $50!? Meet was not cooked to proper temp, basically extra well done and the fries were cold and soggy.",1
The food is always great. Service is awesome. Love the decor.,5
Great food at a reasonable price. Onion rings were exceptional.  Service was amazing. I will definitely go back.,5
"Waited about 20 min at lunch time, but it was definitely worth it. The ""Our Burger"" was absolutely delicious, one of the best I've had. We also had a side on onion rings which were done well, not to oily or over powering. It does kind stick that sides do not come with the burger, especially for the prices, but the taste of the food makes up for that by far.",5
Good burger.  Clean friendly place. Would eat here again.,4
"Great burger, tasty meat soft buns, very good ones. Only the slow and a bit unattentive service makes it 4 stars... give it a try if you are around.",4
"Very pricey, only had a few pop options, didnt even stay when we found out its 25 for a hamburger and a Additional  5.00 for fries... I know its the strip but this was no fancy place...",1
"The service was terrible, the waitress was very rude. My mom and I asked for well done burger mom for to the middle of her burger it was red, mine was pinky. When we asked for the manager he was on break and then never came. There solution was to give 50% off the burger. Would not recommend. Food was not seasoned and macaroni and cheese was terrible. Kraft would have been better.",1
"The food was disgusting!
Ordered 2 ceaser salads with beef, the salad had absolutely no dressing, the beef patty was not cooked if I wanted plain lettuce I would have gone to the supermarket (wish I could insert photo of how bad it was)
I also ordered 2 of the “Our Burgers”, looked like they had been slapped together, once again the patty was raw, the lettuce was brown, oil kept running out of it. And the fries were soggy and black!
If I could do no stars I would due to being so disappointed with this food!
For the price we paid the food was definitely not up the that standard.
Really DO NOT recommend!!!!!",1
Was soo good! Had the house burger with sweet potato tots and onion rings. Been craving the sides everyday since! Cant wait to go back.,5
"The restaurant was cool.  We had the onion rings that were really good! I had the OUR burger...it was ok.  The shredded lettuce made the bun soggy, and the meat itself wasn't real thick or juicy.  It was good but nothing special.",3
Great atmosphere. Food excellent. Staff friendly. Location great,4
The food was delicious! The staff was prompt and friendly. Waters were refilled and food came up hot and fresh. I would eat here again. It’s definitely comfort food. Share a side for couples. The burgers are very filling!,5
"Great food. Best onion rings ever! Staff was super nice only snafu was my dad had to park his scooter far from where we sat. I do have a new favorite dessert, fluffernutter sandwich with ice cream. YUMMY!",5
"We went on a busy Sunday, got seated really quickly. We sat at the bar where you could order your food and drinks there too. Our food came really quickly considering it was so busy and was all fresh and so, so good. Service was very friendly and helpful. I can only describe the burgers as tasting like an authentic home made burger. We also ordered onion rings which are like no other!  (they are really thinly shredded onion in a crisp batter, almost like fries) We had heard about the show and that was the reason we decided to eat here and it didn't disappoint. We definitely saved the best until last on this holiday.",5
"I was moved by the service and food at this place. The portions are big, so you can share the food. Check them out!",5
Great burgers. Onion rings are great. Sweet potato tots were a bit bland.,4
We come here every time we come to Vegas!  We love it!!  Great food!  Great atmosphere!!  Awesome people!!  We will continue to frequent Wahlburgers every time we go to Vegas!!!!  I recommend it highly!!!,5
This is probably the best burger I've ever eaten.The staff our very friendly and hard working.When I went to the one in San Jose it was just the same way.I highly suggest going here for just a little pricey bill that is totally worth it.👍🏻,5
I was pretty pleased by the quality of the chicken and the fish sandwich that we had. The sweet potato cubes were wonderful. Service was a little iffy even though the restaurant was not that busy. Recommended.,4
"great meat, best taste of burger meat ever! We had it on protein style, came with a huge plate of salad, same price. Wonderful experience. Highly recommended.",5
"Wahlberg’s is amazing and very tasteful!!! Great atmosphere. If you’ve been here you know that, If you haven’t get to the nearest to you and go try it, you won’t be disappointed. At this particular location in Vegas our server was Carlos. Carlos was amazing, extremely nice, polite and knew his restaurant. The professionalism of this man was unbelievable. We need more servers and people like Carlos in this world. He’s definitely a 1 of a kind. Thank you Wahlburgers and Carlos you guys are all the best!!! My family and I got a picture from the photographer woman here and it was a beautiful picture and it was great to get a memory like this captured. Wahlburgers is here to stay and that’s good news for us all!!! Now just time to get them separated more throughout the US. Maybe located your next one in Utah hahaha my family and I would love that.",5
"Everyone enjoyed the food, burgers were good. Husband got a 'specialty' shake for adults, he enjoyed it.  Family of 4 was $109 before tip, which if you pay w/a card is precalculated for you at 18% and 20%...least favorite part.  If you bring me 4 burgers and 4 sodas, it'd have to be pretty special to warrant a $20 tip.  Go for the experience, just be ready for the bill.",4
It was decent food I didnt like the price mostly.  I understand that the location requires it though.  The wife got the our burger not any sauce on the burger at all.  I enjoyed my bbq burger but I tasted nothing of bbq I'm mostly from the south so maybe it's just me.,3
I ate here a few days ago and we were not going to stop in but I'm glad we did! Our server was really friendly and made lots of suggestions! The burger was cooked perfectly and the sweet potato tots were Amazing!,5
Delicious burgers and outstanding service! A little bit pricey for burgers and fries but oh well. It was 👌🏼,5
"Burgers were delicious, fries were  OK but onion rings were really good. I would  definitely recommend to eat here. Also, the prices are reasonable.",4
Really bad service I’m surprised wow,1
A favorite place for quality Burgers. Staff is always timely even when they have a full house. I look forward to a return visit. Mood here reminds me of San Diego's scene.,5
"Food was delicious!!! The green cups you are able to take home, which is awesome! Great atmosphere and staff was very nice!",5
Burgers were great. As good as anywhere else I've been. Staff were all friendly. Expect a waiting time.,5
The fiesta burger was one of my top 3 burgers if choice. Great quality of meat and the cocktails were delicious. Thanks Mark !!,5
I grabbed your mom's sloppy joe while here and they hooked me up with a souvenir cup and complimentary postcard. This made me feel right at home. Tasted just like my mom's sloppy Joe's! I love the simplicity and vibe of the whole restaurant. The fandom was pretty wild for me because Mark is a big crush of mine!,5
Best onion rings that I've ever had!,5
"The burgers were amazing, our order was correct, and the employees were nice. It is a bit on the pricey side but I'm honestly ok with it because of how good the food was.",5
"Great atmosphere, and awesome employees. The food was great. The waiter was very quick with drink's and service.

If you want a great experience with great food, Wahlburgers is a great choice.",5
"I do not claim to be a burger aficionado, but every time I eat here the quality of the dining experience blows my mind.  It is a burger, but it always tastes so good.  It is quickly becoming a must stop for me when in Vegas.",5
"Ordered our burger and hubby had the BBQ bacon burger.  We both enjoyed them (fries for me and he had the onion strings as sides). Our one year old enjoyed the food as well. :) For those with strollers, make sure your server seats you nearby as we almost had ours stolen by a little girl.  The server told us that there was no room for it so to leave it at the wall near the left side of the restaurant (near the drink station).  So parents, beware and please teach your children to not touch other people's things.  Our stroller was parked with 2 other strollers too.",4
"I love Wahlburgers, but this Wahlburgers is not nearly as good as the one I first had in Boston. It's still a great place to grab a burger, fries, and a shake. This place is a little tucked away off of the strip , which is nice because it's not always super packed. It is still walking distance from strip.",4
"What you get is decent strip fare, nothing to write home about. Party of five ate for about a C-note, including one wheat-based beverage, a creamsicle float, and two fountain drinks. For parties of more than two, you'll want to order more than one side of fries, which comes in a small cup. The onion rings were good, and were unique in that they were very finely sliced. Probably won't return, but who knows...",4
"First, we come in and are maybe the third table in the restaurant so considering they were not busy, it was very slow. The burgers are good but nothing extra special. The fries were horrible. Just frozen fries that were made and sat under warmer long before our burgers were done. Had much higher expectations. Would not recommend and won't be back.",2
"Service was mediocre, our fries and tater tots arrived cold.  We had the sriracha coca cola wings, they we not great.  The adult milk shake was phenomenal.",3
Great burgers! Good beers! Excellent service. Perfect combination!,5
Good burger but for extremely expensive for what it is. Nothing crazy about flavor. Honestly better places to go. You are basically paying for the name,3
"Loved it! Burgers were great, sweet potato tots  and mac and cheese were really great. Highly recommend.",5
It has great atmosphere. The food was amazing. Very friendly staff.,5
"Oh how much I enjoyed each bite of my burger and the company I was with. Great place, great staff - our waitress was very respectful and attentive. Road trip from San Antonio Tx and was not going to leave Vegas without stopping by. Got our complimentary photo post card and left with some cool merch.",5
"Not sure what happened with others. Yes we waited but host was pretty close on time, 45 min but it was right at 1pm on a long weekend Sunday. Staff were friendly and prompt. Our server , william, was quick and had drinks ordered in about 1 min of sitting down. Food was quick maybe 15 min. Our burgers were good and fresh cooked perfect med. Fries and old style onion rings very good. Overall a nice place for a decent burger.",4
"First burger I had that did not upset my stomach. It is prepared fresh and those fries are very very very very good. Great job, great staff",5
"Was craving burgers for the few days I was in Vegas, I tried several restaurants and was left disapointed. I'm so happy we stopped here before going back, the burgers we're delicious! I would fly back to Vegas just to eat here. Flavorful food and great service.",5
We had the Our Burger and Tater Tots at the Las Vegas location...it was a great burger...I've been waiting years to try it as Iive in Canada and there are no locations close to us...I am so glad I finally got to try it...so worth the wait...the servers are great too!,5
Chili was a little bland. burger was adequate.customer service was good. A little too much ice in the lemonades.,3
Overall the place was amazing! The pork Mac n cheese and onion strings were the best!! Kinda pricey though. I would make one suggestion to add and air conditioner. It was sooo hot in there and it's only March. I can't imagine going to that place in the summer.,5
The Turkey burger was pretty good. I  could really taste the ingredients they stood out. The macaroni and cheese the pasta was not al dente . The burger where tasted good but I wouldn't have said  they where better than any  greasy spoon back home .The buns were cool like they got them out of refrigerator.  The fries where cold of all the sides that should of not been messed up. This will not be on strip for long . After newness had worn of and they can say they have been there .,3
"I'll start by saying the food was good.  The customer service experience was among the worst I have had at any restaurant.  When my wife and I walked in (first time there) we looked around and saw that it resembled a Chipotle type situation where you order and find a seat. We ordered our food and while I waited my wife found a booth.  A waiter promptly went to her and told her we could not eat there as we ordered takeout.  Confused we told him we ordered our food and had no intention of taking out anything, but was going to eat there.  He insisted it was their policy and stated he would get the manager because we couldn't stay there.  We asked him to please bring the manager to our table. The waiter returned ...not the manager...and told us they decided we could stay.  All this with a half empty restaurant and plenty of seating.  I have never been harassed or treated like this anywhere else.",1
"Really average food for the price, could have got a better meal at McDonald's for a fraction of the price.
My wifes burger was raw, the fries were skinny cheap fries that they buy by the ton and charge a lot for.
Showed the hostess my wife's burger she had put aside.... 3/4's still there, barely eaten. She didn't offer to cook it more or anything, we paid, we left.... NEVER TO RETURN!!",1
Great food and great service!!,5
"We came to Wahlburgers because they have the Impossible Burger and it seemed like a good spot for both of us since my friend isn't a vegan. Well, it started off with a rude host seating us followed by me finding a fly in my cup of water. The manager was very dismissive of the fact and just said that it must have come from the spigot. She didn't even apologise or offer to compensate some of our meal. The only thing she asked was if I wanted a new cup of water. I feel like that should have been assumed from the start, but we just decided to go to Gordon Ramsay's Burger instead. We had much better luck over there.",1
The burger was top notch and their fries were just as good. I bought a souvenir cup and will be back to get a refill soon.,5
"Had a great experience here. First time at a wahlburger, but my burger was excellent and service was very good. Will be back.",5
"Way over priced and have had better burgers. Shoestring onion wings don't taste like onion rings at all. Way to thin. I was thinking when I read it that it was thin batter. That is all you taste, no onion.",2
The prices were a little high but definitely worth it! I had the fiesta Burger and it is hands down the best burger I've ever had,5
One of the best burgers I have ever had and their sweet potato tots were so good too!!,5
We were so excited to try Wahburgers and so disappointed with the outcome.  The server was horrible and didn't listen to our order at all.  The portions were so small for the price you pay.  The fries were suppose to be Yukon Gold and I'm pretty sure they were just McCain fries.  They looked and tasted like frozen McCain fries.  So disappointed.  We will never go back.,1
"Pretty expensive but worth it. The service is great, establishment is clean and thorough. Will definitely eat there again.",5
The best bbq bacon burger,5
Freindly nice place,5
"If you like to eat at places that are only around due to a famous person attached their name to it than this is it for you. If you want a burger for a third of the price just stick to in and out. The wait is long, the device is poor, and th food is worse. If you come in with a large party definitely make sure you all have one person paying because they cannot split checks. Learned that the hard way as we were not informed with our party of 11. If you want a drink it automatically comes in the souvenir cup and there is no discount for a second drink. The drinks are mediocre on a good day. The burgers are thin and taste like the people who make them think salt is spicy. No flavor. The Mac and cheese taste like you took some powder cheese but just a dash and mixed it with water. The noodles are made of cardboard I swear. The servers are not attentive and are extremely rude. I've been too a lot of places in Vegas that are over priced but this one takes the cake for what you get.",2
We've seen the ads so we had to give it a try. The food was good and no pricier than other burger places. We enjoyed the experience and would probably go back if we were near a location.,4
"I'm not sure if it was a staffing problem or what, group of 6 people, all of our orders were messed up to some degree and none of us liked the food we ate. I appreciate that things happen but I'm certain none of us will go back for the expensive ""government cheese"" cousine.",1
"Visited while attending a conference at Bally's. Food was pretty good but nothing spectacular. Service was not great especially for a night that wasn't very busy. Only saw someone once after they delivered our food, which did actually come out pretty quick, but when it came time to bring the bill, they had no clue what we ordered so we had to re-list everything we ordered so she could write it down this time and then still took another 10 minutes to bring us our checks.",3
"The food and burgers was delicious, I'm ready to go back there to eat, I only hope that Mark Walhberg will be there too.",5
"Fiesta burger was delicious! It had a good spice to it, but not overwhelming. Paired perfect with a Wahlbrewski",5
Save your money there are many other burgers that are much better and cheaper and you don't have to wait. Place is small no organization very very loud. Some lady kept asking us over and over about taking our picture for free very strange.,1
"Spotted this Wahlburger just outside Bally's, where we're staying, after a long day of walking the Strip. Decided to have dinner. We both enjoyed Jenn's chicken salad. Very tasty, and a good size portion.

The service was good, fairly fast despite the crowds. The staff was friendly. Clean tables, despite the crowds. They keep up with the cleaning.

The star was lost because the ambiance was not my cup of tea. Very loud and chaotic with the dinner crowd. Glad we had a booth because the tables seemed a bit packed in. Hard to have a conversation due to the noise level. But I'd eat there again, just maybe hoping for a quieter time.",4
"Great atmosphere, average burgers and friendly staff. I guess it's a place to go if you want to be able to say you ate there lol. The food was as average as you would get anywhere really. Pretty small burgers for the price you pay.",4
"Sooooooo delicious! I've never had mac n cheese from government cheese that was so good! Obviously it was made from more cheese than that, but still. I'd go back any day of I could.",5
"This place did NOT disappoint!
Really good food! I tried the turkey Thanksgiving burger and omg, it's amazing plus tht sweet potato tots are the best I've ever tried, crispy on the outside & soft in the middle. Service is hands down awesome. Ordered and got my food within 10 minutes. Our server Diane M was so awesome! So nice and such great service with a fast response time.",5
"One of the best juicy burger I had in Vegas. Great customer service and clean environment. Price is fair. I had chef Ramsay's Burger and it was a big disappointment. Meat was bland, fries were stile. If you don't want to wait for more than an hour and have a great burger, good environment, fair price, go to Wahlburgers. I'm not paid to write these up like others people! You know who you are. Everything is base on experience. Stay away from Ramsay's burger and steakhouse! Overprice, bad experience, and food is average.",5
Food was great and our server Bill was friendly and attentive. Great experience.,5
Great food HORRIBLE service. Wait time was 45 minutes after 45 minutes they add another 15 minutes 3 different times we asked about our table. Multiple people how were after us in line got seated before us . They also messed up our order twice. Not pleased.,3
Great taste. Got a double hamburger. Get at least that. McDonald's sized patties on their burgers. Onion rings were great as well. Wahlbruski beer was a good tasting beer as well.,4
Food was amazing and so was our waiter.,5
The burger I had was absolutely delish.  Pretty quick service too.,5
Ahhh was super excited to go for lunch.. and what a lunch!  Got a fab salad and the yummiest cocktail. Excellent service and nice clean area.. even tho the restaurant was very busy we got seated and fed quite quickly.  Got a beautiful photo taken as a momento.. excellent!,5
10/10 great and Quick service. Had the BBQ Burger and a side of onion rings (soooo good). Server Amber was excellent. Affordable prices and super tasty food.,5
"We stopped in after walking by, my husband is a huge Wahlburgers fan. We both enjoyed our meals very much, I got the Our Burger salad, and it was great flavors and a clever way to do a salad, I actually got the onion ring side and added them to my salad and it was even more perfect. That little crunch in each bite made it to die for. My husband got the fiesta burger and LOVED every bite. We tried a spiked lemonade as well. The atmosphere was very welcoming and the staff was great. My only complaint was the picture lady. She took pur picture with the offer of a free post card, when she came to give it to us, she offered for us to buy pictures. When we declined she kept trying to give better deals but I explained that I just didn't  like the photo  she rolled her eyes and just didnt seem friendly after. It's a cool idea, but I would just get rid of the camera person. Otherwise we will totally be back!",5
"I'm visiting Las Vegas from Baltimore MD
S topped at Walhberger... Food was good and my waitress Diana was fantastic... Friendly and attentive",5
Incredible!!!,5
"I loved wahlbergers. Delicious burger, onion rings just like at a seafood shack down the cape. Delicious sauces.",5
Good but not great. The chili was blah. Almost just ground beef.,3
"Service is awesome, price was okay, burgers were good.  Nuthan extra special, but it was cool to do once.",5
"The general manager was amazing taking care of us the our waiter, William was fantastic.  Food was excellent.  Had the pleasure of also meeting Donnie Wahlberg.",5
Loved it!! One of my have to go to place in Vegas for my first time... Food was so good and the take home cup i love it!,5
Good food.  Happy that they have the impossible burger but it is 20 dollars and you cant have it protein style (the lettuce is pre shredded) and there is no vegan cheese option. :(,4
"Really enjoyed our double burger and Mac & cheese. Both were delicious. However when we ordered our drinks we were asked small medium or large. We order medium not really knowing the size. It comes with a souvenir glass that costs 14 dollars. The waiter never elected to tell us this information. It is on the menu but slightly obscure. 2 stars for food quality, annoyed at paying more for cheap plastic glassses then all my food combined.",2
The food did not disappoint! Delicious and decent price. Wish there was one closer to where i live. Will visit the next time we are in vegas,5
"Great place tucked in the back of the strip. Mac & Cheese was excellent, as was the burger melt. If you haven't been there, you need to go.",5
We came to Las Vegas to see JLo and one of the places on our list to stop was Wahlburgers.   So glad we did.  My burger was delicious and made exactly how I wanted it.  Alex our server was excellent.  Very attentive and even washed out our cups to take home with us.   I highly recommend this place.  Only down side...... Mark was not there.,5
"Went here with my fiance for a Thursday lunch and was seated immediately. The atmosphere was a little loud but typical for Vegas. Our server was attentive but not overbearing.

I got the ""Our Burger"" which can only be described as a burger for the purist. It was cooked to medium with a healthy dose of crumchy fresh veggies enveloping the perfectly cooked 1/3 lb. patty all sandwiched  between a toasted bun. I added bacon because...well, Vegas. It was simply fantastic!

My better half got the BBQ Bacon burger which, of course, I tried. It was good but very similar to many other bbq burgers I've had.

As a side, we got fries and onion rings. The fries were fresh and perfectly salted. The onion rings were very similar to a blooming onion kind of taste but deconstructed. While they were tasty, they were small in size and not good for dipping. It's possible we got the last of the batch.

Overall a very good experience and the next time I'm I'm in the Boston area or in Vegas, I will be sure to return.",5
"Very good burgers (that turkey burger was awesome 😍) and the employees were very very friendly. The concept is really good, congratulation 💪🏼",5
"Being a fan of pretty much everything Wahlberg, I naturally had to eat at Wahlburgers. Mark being my favorite, I got Thanksgiving burger. I'm never eating Thanksgiving leftovers the same. Now I'm grilling up burgers next day, then putting all ingredients on burger.",5
One of the best burger places in vegas.  Simple great food and atmosphere.,5
Great burger fries and onion strings. Servers were excellent macaroni salad was not good very dry,5
Fast and friendly service with great food. If you want a better than average burger this is the place.,5
"Always great food.   Generally go with the 'Impossible Burger'.  This location has a Honey Brown beer that is really good,  too bad it is a local brew",5
"The food was good but our server was awful. All we wanted was a to go box and he kept ignoring our table because we still had food left. The only way we could get his attention was to push our food to the edge of the table with our napkins on it.

reply to owner:  send me your email address and i can email you",2
"Mark makes good movies but so-so burgers, that you could buy at Sam's. The sides are overrated like the burgers. I wasn't impressed with the seating host, who questioned me like a TSA agent, he said I already ordered at the counter ( I asked the counter cashier where the seating was); eventually he sat us down after the interview; then there was this disheveled wanna be famous guy asking people if they wanted their photo with him; come to find out he's Mark's former driver/ bodyguard. I guess he's famous right? I liked the restaurant architecture, so I gave two stars.  Save your money and go to the Habit.",2
Great food,5
Amazing food and coustomer service the only thing that would have put it through the roof would have been Donnie himself.....says my wife 🌝,5
The hostess not friendly at all to worried about the time or her smart watch. Service sucks the waitress were picking and choosing who would serve us. Waited over 10 minutes just for our drink order. Pricey food in small portions.,1
"Meh. It's a hamburger. The potato bun is really good, but everything else is your basic get it anywhere burger. It's fun that its owned by famous people, but that is about it's only unique offering.",3
Atmosphere is fantastic and the food is unique. Flavours are so well blended.,5
I had lunch at Wahlburgers yesterday.... I had the O.F.D burger with french fries... I got so sick after eating that hamburger.... they have no restrooms...... you have to go outside to the right of the restaurant. To get to the women’s room. and around the escalator to find the men’s room. I started to go back into the restaurant just so I can ——-. Maybe it’s East Coast food versus West Coast food.....,2
"4 stars for the food and the service. Great service with an attentive waiter.

Fries were good, but not shove in your mouth like some fresh Wendy's. Sweet potato tots were really good! Burgers deserve the 4 stars but I don't think they contend for top 3 in my experience. Definitely not over a couple Seattle joints like Lil Woodys or 8oz Burger Co.

The 5th star gets taken away for price. $130 for our group of 4 to eat some hamburgers. We probably would've spent only $40 at in N Out.

But we did enjoy it. We all enjoyed our picks, so if you're okay with the potential price, get yourself a seat and make sure to order one of the fantastic boozy shakes.",4
"Great burgers, good drinks, and I loved the onion rings. Friendly staff. Prices aren't bad, maybe a little on the high side but so is everything in Vegas.",5
Great burgers great onion rings,5
Visited this place a couple of times whilst in Vegas and every time was treated to Great burgers also had Really friendly staff would definitely recommend,5
The food was great!  Our server was friendly and checked on us regularly. The serving of onion rings was huge!  I wasn't able to finish everything and I left happy and stuffed.,5
I really love burgers. It's always a toss up between Wahlburgers and Ramsay Burger. Never been disappointed with the service or the food. Thanksgiving sandwich is awesome,5
Probably the best burger I ever had and the prices are about the same as a sitdown restaurant.  The food is great,5
The food and staff were absolutely amazing.  Hands down the best burger in town.  The bar staff was awsome!!!,5
Super great service,5
"It was just meh. Got the ""our burger"" and it tasted like a big mac. Not bad by any means but the burger was 10$ and didn't come with fries or anything. All of the sides were 5$. It all tasted fine, what you're really paying for here is the brand. Nothing special.",3
Burgers here are great! Nice outside eating area. Recommend.,4
The burger was good.  There really isn’t anything special.  Prices seemed high but it is Vegas.  The staff was very friendly.  It’s an average burger joint.,3
Great food and welcoming staff.  First time at a Wahlburgers!,5
Was very disappointed!! Service was great! But the burger I had didn't even come close to looking like the tv show! I'm big fan also! I guess if it was filmed on the tv show I'll get a better burger!!,1
"Great food, great service.. Price's are a little high, but really what isn't in Vegas.. for the quality of food and service they are very reasonable.. would definitely come again..",5
"Everything you would expect from the Wahlburgers. Amazing burgers, beer and service. Grab a hoodie while your there",5
"I went into Wahlburgers with some pretty high expectations. I've seen the show, I love burgers, and I think Marky Mark is cool. However, all I could see while being in Wahlburgers is greed. For $12.95, I had a burger. ONE burger. And that's it. Why can't they include some sort of side with the burger? Like, oh I don't know, basic french fries?? At least they do have fries on the menu... for another $4.95. That's unacceptable for a place with ""burger"" in their name. On top of that, Wahlburgers has a kiosk closer to the Strip which is apparently for Wahlburger branded items to buy and it's a bar as well. Well, the day that we were on the Strip, that kiosk was having some sort of a happy hour all day promotion. It would make sense that that same promotion would be going inside of the main Wahlburgers, but alas it was not. Even our waiter didn't quite understand this. The whole experience just seems like it could use a lot of improvement, even though this is a well established place to eat. So it seems like this is the way they're comfortable with operating, and it just seems very greedy.",2
If I could give them a ten star I would. Loved the food loved the service. Happy customer,5
"The atmosphere was fun and energetic. However, the food was bland. Mac and cheese tasted like pasta with creamer on it. In my opinion is was not worth the dollars spent.",2
"Not a very special burger and extremely over priced.    Thousands of craft burger joints are everywhere across the US and seel a way better burger at less than half the price.   The 'Whal Sauce' is nothing more than ketchup, mayonnaise, and pickle juice which is the same as what's used at other small but popular burger chains as well as individually owned stores.  Onion Rings should be Onion Rings, not onion strings.   They were very thinly sliced  and lightly breaded onions.   Not that they weren't good, but they weren't onion rings.   Don't think I'll waste my time or money with this restaurant.   I don't think they'll survive too long now that their show has gone off the air.",2
The Impossible burger wasn't as good as the Beyond Beef.  Fries were good.  Fast service- feels rushed.  Not great if you want to sit and relax.,3
Always great food,5
Burnt cold burger with craft sliced cold cheese on top..,1
"Went here on Tuesday for dinner, was seated immediately. I would think that when I am paying $13 for a double burger (2, 3 ounce patties) that it would include a side with it. Well I was wrong, you have pay extra if you want fries. I ended up going for the Macaroni & Cheese with bacon, that is an additional $8. The best part was the bacon. The cheese sauce was watery and lacked flavor and left the pasta dry. Cheese is supposed to be creamy and should stick to the pasta. To get the cheese I had to drink it out of the cup. I do not think I will go back, $32 for a burger, macaroni and a beer.",2
"If love a good burger, eat here. Burgers are large with many different toppings . We had a wonderful  waitress  , excellent servie.  I would definitely eat here  again. It located right on the strip.",5
"Good burger and tots. Fun atmosphere,  busy but service is quick and friendly.",4
Try the Fluffa Nutta! SO tasty!,5
The burger was fantastic and the atmosphere was perfect. The whole family loved it.,5
"We got 1 ""our burger"" & 1 ""dad's basic"". The our burger was delicious. The sauce and pickles were yummy. Kind of disappointed that they don't come with at least fries or anything for an $11 burger. Not really worth it. We went around 7pm and the bartender kept telling us the kitchen was backed up. We waited a while for our two burgers. Also there were hairs on the bar counter which was gross. The restaurant seating area is small. It is connected to this large long bar that has an entire open window for outside service which is inconvenient because there's no a/c inside. However, they do have a good exhaust/fan system in the building so it wasn't terribly hot in there.",3
"no a/c, food too expensive, (fries not included), the sweet potato tots were coated with powder sugar (very american), overrated place just like Vegas.",3
The burgers were fine but not as amazing as the show makes them out to be. Had to sit at the bar because the place was so crammed. Edit: I was there April 26th 2019.,3
This was our first time to eat at this establishment and it was great! Many people say it is a little pricey but everything is in Vegas! We both got burgers and couldn't decide if we wanted sweet potatoe tots or onion rings and our server Dakota said he can give us a little bit of both to try. Dakota was amazing! He constantly checked in and made sure we both enjoyed our first visit there. I'm in the food industry and it is hard to come by these employees. So Dakota did so great we will definitely be returning!,5
It was pretty good. The burger buns and onion rings I think was great! Great customer service,4
"Food was nothing spectacular.   Sides and drinks have to ordered seperately.  I went in and waited quite a while to be seated and then another 20 minutes before a waitress came to ask what we wanted for drinks.  Then I thought my drinks were forgotten but after 10 min I got them.  After the food order arrived I was disappointed.   Tater tots were hard as biscuits.  Honestly I expected more.  Better places to eat on the strip with the same costs.  go somewhere else.
O and I'm not sure how many times I saw the wait and cooking staff joking and talking amongst each other while I was waiting.   Obvious  customer service is not a concern.",2
"Was not impressed with the food at all. The service was good but high prices for drinks in plastic glasses, the burger and sloppy joes were bland! Especially the sloppy joes, it was greasy and had no flavor at all. If all the locations are like this... all you’re paying for is the name.",2
"This is for the bar near the street, they had great drink deals and there was a server melena I think, she was awesome and put us on to some new drinks! Went back every day",5
"Very decently priced,  tasty and quality food, great service, overall very pleased with my experience. (:",5
Much better than expected. Excellent service and food. Would definitely go again. Only about 20 mins from time we walked in til we ate.,5
Awesome burgers and amazing service! There a couple bars across the sidewalk where you can wait for your table too! The drink selection is fantastic and the cheese fries are great!,5
"Excellent burgers.  Charge extra for anything with the burgers, but still excellent.  Expect to spend over $50 for two people if you get anything to drink.",4
Food was amazing. The flavors of the burgers were wonderful. We had the bbq bacon burger & the beast burger. Great!,5
Phenomenal place to eat.  The food was spectacular! We had to wait a bit to be seated but it was well worth it,5
"Took the family to the Vegas Wahlburgers. Was super busy, two things shocked me the most and the reason I'm leaving 4/5 stars. 1. Burger was WAY under cooked. I mean moo-ing on the plate. 2. All the prices are separate and we didn't realize that. Spent $92 for 4 cokes, 4 fries and 4 reg burgers, THAT'S HIGH!$$",4
Great burgers and wonderful atmosphere. Staff was courteous and efficient and the lemonade was bottomless. Fantastic experience overall.,5
"Great service, delishous food! Loved it and can't wait to try different locations. Would love to see a Wahlburgers in Arizona!",5
Best Burgers on EARTH. Non greasy and the frys also non greasy. Absolutely the best.  I wish Wahlburgers was in Alberta. 👍🍔,5
Great service and friendly staff. Food was amazing as well,5
"Needs AC, dirty",1
"Great food and service, but chocolate milk could've used a bit more chocolate",4
There burgers are amazing. Sat at the bar this time. Would have been great if the fan wasn't blowing in my face the hole time,4
Burgers were like what my Mum cooked when I small and the service was excellent. A little expensive but this is Vegas.,4
"Not one bit disappointed!
Food is great.
We'll be back to eat and live chat with a Wahlburger real soon.
Look forward to it.
Now that we're locals in Las Vegas, NV....
Linda & Stephen",5
Wow. Great food. Thought it was hype.  But it was really good,5
"Had ""The Beast"" and was impressed by the service and the burger was delicious. The gluten free bun that was used on the Bacon burger was soft and fresh. One of the best gluten free buns around! #glutenfree",5
The burger and onion rings were great. The server was very friendly and the food came out quick.,4
Amazing food and staff!!! Everyone was great they under promise and over deliver.,5
"I am a connoisseur of chocolate martinis. I have found none better. Pat O'Grady  makes the best chocolate martini you will find anyplace! You owe it to yourself to try it. And, if you wish, tell him I sent you. I can't wait to return to Las Vegas to have another one...or two.",5
Burgers were amazing. Cooked to perfection.  I had the BBQ burger and my wife had the original cheeseburger. We were in town for 4 days and with all the places to dine at we ate there twice!,5
Fantastic customer service and delicious food! We stumbled on this place by mistake on a recent trip and loved it.,5
"I enjoyed the burger, as I do with most burgers. Is it anything to rave about? Not really. I've had plenty of burgers with assorted toppings, sauces, and flavors for a few dollars less, and enjoy them just the same - if not more. I think this place draws an especially lengthy crowd at times just because of the ""Wahlberg"" name attached. If you have to wait more than 10-20 minutes for a seat, you may want to consider other options. Service was friendly, but interaction was limited.",3
"Very friendly staff, good food and a great atmosphere.
The only issue I had was most of my order was forgotten and my friends cheeseburger still had the cheese wrapper on it which added a little suprise,  all and all the staff did make it right..

So lucky for them I'm going to let this peacock fly..

I give this visit a 8 out of 10..",4
"It was AMazing! just what I was looking for. my server, Dakota did a great job when described all the food and service was awesome",5
Food and atmosphere was good. Our whole party of 10-12 enjoyed their food.,5
"The food was boring and the service was mediocre. Drinks and food for my partner and I was $45 including gratuity. A little steep for what it is. The idea is there, and they certainly have the name to bring in business, but you definitely get the feeling it's completely over thought. I'd recommend if you're looking for a meal in this range to look elsewhere.",2
"Three stars bc it was just a burger. We were expecting a top notch burger and we just got burger that we could have cooked ourselves.  The meat was slightly bland and the topping took away from the patty which should always be the star in a burger. The onion rings were made with red onions which was a nice surprise but they were so salty we could barely eat them. We thought it was expensive for the quality you got. Sorry, Mark and Donny!",3
"My husband had been looking forward to trying this place out for the longest time, and we were so disappointed. Overpriced and underwhelming to say the least. If it weren't for their name and prime location, this restaurant would soon be out of business. Locals know good food, and this is not it.",2
Awesome food and Ambiance,5
My wife loved her burger. Guy who waited on us was great. Overall we enjoyed it.,5
"Wait wasn’t long, friendly service. Burger looked as if it was just tossed together. But overall ok. Didn’t care for the chili and cheese on the tater tots. They did provide a free picture of all of us at the table. Seemed a bit over priced.",2
Delicious! My burger had great flavor and was perfectly cooked. The fried pickles were delicious and my spiked cherry coke was amazing.,5
Great burgers and vibe inside. Getting to keep the drink cup was a nice touch. Got horrible food poisoning after though.,2
Great food and service,5
Fiesta Burger was deeeelicous,5
"Outstanding food and service. Glutinous and healthy choices for everyone. Super yummy mac and cheese, and a souvenir cup to take home. It's a win!!",5
Oh my god best burger ever. Price was perfect food was perfect Fredy our waiter on point. Wouldn't change a thing.,5
"We LOVED Wahlburgers! We had just a 15 minute wait and they texted us so we could go walk around. The service was outstanding and the food.... oh boy! It was amazing! Huge portions and not as pricey as I was expecting! They even put our drinks in souvenir cups! The onion rings are off the chain and the government cheese was delicious! The menu is huge.... offering a trifecta of favorites.  This family knows what people want.  I can't say enough good things! The only disappointment was that Mark wasn't there lol
Can't wait to try the Detroit location back in our home state of Michigan.",5
I had the melt.  Incredible sandwich.  The Mac and cheese was out of this world.  Bar prices very reasonable as compared to others on the strip.,5
"Great food, great staff.  Our server, Diane, was engaging and funny.",5
The atmosphere is enviting and clean. The service and detailed information for the menu was explained perfectly. The beef was cooked to perfection upon order and very fresh. A very great experience and I will return.,5
Tried it for the first time and didn't disappoint! The Burgers and service was great!,5
We came in with a party of 8 and we sat down immediately!! Took less than 10 minutes for our food!! Very impressed with the service. The food was beyond amazing... Everything is so fresh!,5
Pretty good burgers. They taste like home made ones. The Sunrise Mountain beer is local and delicious also.,5
Got the double decker in Las Vegas. Nearly strayed away because I had an outside drink and the greeter turned us away but my fiance loves you guys show so we had to just chug em down and come back. Glad we did. Excellent service and delicious burger thanks and keep up the good work.,5
OMG! I've been wanting to come here for years! Since there aren't any in AZ we made sure we stopped here while we were in town and it did not disappoint! Such good food! Cant wait to come again!!,5
Never disappoints.,5
Very good burgers. Above the average burger. It could be a bit bigger but worth every penny.,5
"Had a great burger and a mountain of onion rings! Loved the whole experience. Will keep this one on the list  many say it's overpriced but I say what isn't overpriced in vegas, especially on the strip.",5
After seeing the show for years i had to make a visit here and I was very happy with my experience. We were seated in minutes and the food came out relatively quickly after we ordered. The bread was slightly over toasted on the point of burnt but that is the only negative thing from my time at wahlburgers.,4
"First time here, ordered a burger with no pickles and it came with pickles. No big deal, I told the waitress she takes the burger back. Couple minutes later she brings a burger out to me. Guess what? Same burger just pickles removed...pickle juice still on the bun! Never again!!!!",1
"The woman at the front desk reception was very unkind. We are two spaniards good english speakers but we couldn’t understand what she was trying to say -quite quickly and in bad manners-. We needed 4 times to understand because she didn’t slow down while showed a very bad expression all the time. Today 08/23/19, at 9:00pm",1
Good food fast service. Fun place!,5
Best hamburger I have eaten in awhile. Service excellent. A little hard to find from the strip.,5
"The Turkey burgers were great... the Thanksgiving burger and the double with mushrooms and bacon, fantastic.",5
"We come here every time we're in town. Got in late, came by and had a nice bite. Late night hours of course because...Las Vegas baby!",5
Really nice burger and friendly atmosphere. Not too expensive for the area. Simple food done well,4
Food is delicious but do they really need to use disposable everything? Really wish they could be a bit more sustainable with their packaging choices.,4
"1st trip to a Wahlburgers, Really enjoyed our food here, so often you ask for medium rare and it's well done. Burger was perfect! Staff was friendly.",5
Great tots!,5
"The place was very busy, thus the service was kind of slow. The waitress was nice and was able to sense when we were frustrated about the long wait. She adequately apologized. I had the impossible Burger which wasn't on the menu, I but specifically asked for it. It was delicious. My sisters loved the other Burgers so much that they ordered two. I really respect Mark Wahlburg as an actor and I was glad to visit his place.",4
"They're food was awesome, staff were friendly and helpful, and its location was easily accessible. I really liked the pictures they took of my husband and I. I will definitely return!",5
"Good burger, but not great for the value. $12 burger is too much.  Restaurant trying to be fast food and sit down, but succeeds 100% at neither.",3
It was good...waiter was awesome...burgers were yummy... The whole time was great...,5
Oh My Gosh!!! Had the Supermelt and gator tots. So good. Very reasonably priced for Las Vegas. Nice drink and beer menu. Visible from The Strip in a shopping district across from the Bellagio.,5
"One of best places , where u would enjoy with family , friends and everyone u would wanna be with
Best ones - our burger and thanksgiving burger",5
"Food is good but paid $50 for 2 burgers, fries and a beer. Definitely overpriced. 3 stars for the food , ""0"" for the actual value. You can get way better food for that much money.",3
Yummy but TINY. $14 for a specialty burger that is  smaller than the palm of  my hand (I have small woman hands). All burgers can be ordered with turkey vs beef- which is great. But the portion is so small...... burgers don't even come with fries....,2
Loved this place. The food is very good and the staff is excellent.,4
"Wasn't a big fan this time around. The service was quick to take your order then never seen again. Different staff brought out our food and forgot a few item. Once brought out, it was cold. Then to top off the end of the night, the server that first took our order asked for our payment asap. I told him we are not ready, he then stood by and watched us pay. He got NO tip from me this time around. I also had a small case of food poisoning later that night. I think it was more to do with ordering the beef more rare than im used to . I will take that upon myself.",2
"Food was good,  nothing super special about it, but it was cooked correctly and tasted like it was supposed to.  Prices are a little steep for the  serving size.  Menu makes a big deal about 'government cheese', opted for the up-charge to get real cheese.",3
Loved this burger. I wish we had this in Florida I would go there often. All ingridienrs were fresh and the burger was nice and juicy.,5
"Worst experience I have ever had ! We will never come back , Trina was our server and was terrible and unprofessional. If you ever chose to eat here and get Trina as your waitress I recommend  you order out or RUN and never come back .",1
"OFD Burger and Fiesta Burger were great! Get the 32oz beer and keep the plastic mug. Casual atmosphere and friendly staff. No restroom inside, but one nearby in the square.",5
Delicious burgers. Wahl sauce is better than Chick-fil-A sauce.,5
The waiter was pretty cool and the picture lady came by to leave us with a memory for being first time customers.,5
"Food was great! OUR burger...onion rings were amazing. Service was excellent. Alas, no Wahlbergs in sight. ;)",5
My favorite it the pulled pork. My husband loved the burgers and brew. Fun stop,5
"Don’t believe the negative or OK reviews. This place puts out some really amazing burgers and fries. Ordered ‘the Beast’, left a satisfied customer!",5
"Great burgers, and the ""melt"" was the hands-down favourite. Service could have been better, as our waitress was inattentive. Great selection of beers on-tap, and centrally located on the strip.",4
First time here 8/17/19 we sat at the bar. definitely not disappointed the staff is great very attentive and the food was delicious the Our Burger was perfect size and we'll cooked.,5
Really solid burger.  Cooked correctly and we'll seasoned.  Fries suck...frozen variety.  Good selection of beers on tap,4
At my age (52) I can only say how awesome the food is here.  The atmosphere and the staff are so willing to help and take care of you.   Now can I get one in Jackson Ms???  What about it Walburgs.,5
"Yummy Haddock Sammy!! Bun really makes it all that! Quick service, clean environment well staffed.",5
Loved the burgers!! They were really tasty. Also the tater tots. I could eat the burgers every day !!,5
"49 year expert burger aficionado here and this was literally the single greatest burger of my lifetime! Marky Mark and the Funky Bros definitely know what they're doing! Whichever city closest to you has a Wahlburgers is a city worth the trip just for this culinary experience. The Vegas locale is easy to find, but only if you've been to LV this decade. It's in the street plaza right out front of Bally's. Burger perfection!",5
"The food is good, the staff is nice, and the restaurant area was very clean. I highly recommend this place.",4
"So happy to go to Vegas and see a wahlburgers! I love there show, so it was a must to eat at. Best burgers hands down! Even a mushroom burger for the vegetarians! You have to eat here if you go to Vegas!!!!",5
"I love this place! Awesome burgers!  Before my momma passed away may of 2016,  she always watched the show and wanted my 2 brothers and I to have the MOM'S FAVORITE shirts but I couldn't afford 2 for them so I got one for myself!!!  A little spendy for a shirt but... My momma always said YOUR MY FAVORITE BUT DON'T TELL YOUR BROTHERS.. (my momma also said the same thing to my brothers and told them not to tell myself and the other brother) I wear my new shirt probably!!!! By the way I AM MOM'S FAVORITE! HEHEHEE 😉💞",5
The chicken sandwich was AMAZING!!,5
Great food but the service is not. Waited for almost ten minutes to get something to drink before we ordered. They have the impossible burger so it was worth waiting for.,3
"I went to Wahlburgers for my first visit and brought my family my sister and brother in-law with me for there first experience as well. Now the hostess or greeter great and friendly but then we were escorted to our table and the floors were covered in grease we nearly fell being escorted to our table.  We ordered our food which was good and the server was professional then we received our bill. Now can someone explain to me how 3 adults ordering food with ZERO alcohol be charged $80.00? No alcohol just soda a the Jenni salad, a Donnie Burger, and a melt with some tots, and fries can be $80.00? We could and should have gone to Five Guys or In & Out and most likely 2/3 less and gotten decent food. Paul Wahlberg was correct they sell burgers it's an indulgence but they over charge they customers because of there fame, from TV, Movies and TV Show. I've reached out personally to Wahlburgers to explain this all to me and I received ZERO response in return except for a tweet on twitter but nothing else. I serious suggest to all before deciding to go any Wahlburgers decide if you truly want to buy into the hype they're pulling over the general public to get more rich off there last name.",1
"Walked in at 3AM, staff was extremely kind and friendly. Food was hot and perfected in taste. Being a girl who's not a party animal- this stop felt more at home than anywhere else on the strip.",5
"The food and drinks were amazing! If your a fan, you appreciate the decor!",5
The Strip Version is overpriced. Even as Strip prices go. The food and service was good.,4
Best burger I have had in a while. It definitely beat in n out for me. The burgers were juicy and amazing.,5
"Very delicious burger, not the best I've bad but a close second...",5
Great service. A bit crowded but the wait staff were always there when we needed them. The food was delicious.,4
"Your cook put cigarette ash in my burger, i was incredibly sick after eating at your Las Vegas location the taste would not leave my mouth. If this franchise or the Whalbegers have any integrity everyone at this location should be fired. 😡",1
"Good service. Comfortable atmosphere. Great food. A little pricey, but delicious nonetheless.",4
Great place. Talked to Paul through a video call they had on Thanksgiving. GM was super nice,5
"Good food, friendly staff, not expensive",5
"Mac and cheese was a huge let down but the sweet potato tots were amazing! You HAVE to ask for a side of cranberry sauce to dip them in, trust me! Burgers were amazing as always! I cant wait for them to expand and not have to make a trip to vegas or gulf shores just for the Walburgers!",4
"We did not stay here for eating, we grabbed a beers and realized the club music from nextdoor pub that was played outside had us shout everytime we wanna communicate something so we decided to eat elsewehere",3
"Waited too long my burger was made wrong.
Then had to wait to get it made right while they kept serving others before me.   Then had to ask twice to get my correct burger.  I gave it 3 stars because atleast the burger was good",3
Great service and a great burger.  Also their sweet potato tots were great,5
"Good burgers for a decent price, you gotta try it at least once. Just to say you have been.",4
"Awesome place,  service was fast.  Food was great.  Spikes strawberry lemonade wad the bomb.",5
"Huge fans of the show, stopped in for a burger and it was over cooked. Our server came to our table twice, to take our order and drop off our check. The service was absolutely horrible, the food was nothing to brag about. We asked to speak to a manager and he was also very rude. Was just a very unpleasant experience and we probably won’t go back or recommend.",1
"Mainly hype, but why not go. If your already there just try it so you could say you been. Taste it's good, but nothing out of this world",4
Amazing  burger. Double decker with mushrooms. Wow!! Juicy goodness. The sweet potato tots were tasty. Worth the price.,5
Definitely paying for the name! $13 for a burger and add $5 if you want a side of fries.... Very disappointed in the poor town boys exploiting their new found fame! This will be the one and only time they get my money.,2
"Unimpressed, trying to be like 5 guys but missing the mark and twice the price. $18 for burger and fries, paper cups and food containers. Much better choices in the area.",2
"Blockhead for life. NKOTB held me through my childhood and now that I'm a mom with an 11 year old daughter who adores their music... To be able to go to Wahlburgers and have a slamming burger totally completes the deal. MUCH LOVE to Wahlburgs, NKOTB and Jenny!",5
"Damn good burgers! Had one in Las Vegas. Friendly staff, very casual place. Hope one comes to mpls!!",5
Amazing burgers. Staff needs a little work. A little in the high end pricing.,4
"In my opinion the food was not worth the price,  even for Vegas prices.  The fries were a small portion for the price and tasted like frozen fries.  Also, while the burger was fine, the size of the patty did not warrant the price.  I will not be eating here again as there are far better alternatives nearby.",2
"The wait here was kind of excessive. The burgers weren't the best but they are good and the buns are amazing.  I would recommend going here once if you are in Vegas for a while, but there are better if you're only in town for a couple days.",4
The bugers were amazing and the prices were better than most things along the Strip.,5
Great tasty and juicy burgers.,5
Love this place. The burgers are awesome and the chicken sandwich is heavenly.,5
"When the food arrived, the order was incorrect and it took 20 minutes to order a replacement. We couldn't find our server, but there was someone waiting to take our picture. We asked them to get our waiter, but they just walked away after we refused the picture. Once we found our waiter (who left before we could finish our meal), we complained that in addition to the incorrect order, the chicken sandwich was delivered soggy. The server let us know, that's normal and they ""just deal with it"". Please, go to Wahlburgers if you want a soggy chicken sandwich.",1
Excellent food!  Best Burger I have ever had and the stringy onion rings are awesome!,5
Did not disappoint!  Burger was delicious.  Wait was 10 mins.  Hostess very friendly.  Server was on point.  Can't wait to visit again.,5
Excellent,5
"Burgers/Tenders/Fries/Salad were average I would of liked to see more creativity in the burgers or that in their ingredients and or unique...just something that had one small wow factor. Service was good, resturaunt was clean, nice location, and enjoyed seeing the Whalburg family photo.",4
"Couldn't wait to try this place as i heard about it from friends in Dublin who visited it before and it did not disappoint,food was out of this world and the service was quick and efficient thanks to our waitress Emma.A must visit if your in Las Vegas,be definitely back b4 we head back to the Emerald Isle 😉😉😉",5
"SUCH good, and super fresh food. Our server was really great and they were packed. There was a little screw up with our order, but she fixed it really quickly and smoothly. Great lunch spot.",5
"Nice flavor, great service, my mate and i ordered triple burgers , fries and sweet potato tots , needed to  order another triple  burger to share. Perhaps a 5 pattie burger would be great.  Overall was happy.",3
Hell no. Never got to taste the food $16 for a 2oz cheese burger. I dont care how gourmet it is do the math that's $128 per pound. I understand  Vegas is a tourist town but dam,1
"The food was perfectly cooked,  the Service was Great and no wait to be seated.",5
"I had the melt. Tasted fresh, bacon was crispy, no complaints. Other reviewers have an issue with the price. If you're worried about the price in Vegas, don't eat on the Strip. I'd come back for a different burger.",4
Awesome drinks. But very very price. You are paying alot for the gimmick. But still worth seeing,4
It was ok. But if you want a good burger on the strip shake shack beats this place hands down.,2
"I had high expectations and was disappointed. Our order was not correct and none of the items we ordered  had flavor/seasoning. Also, our server wasn't engaged and attentive.",2
"We ended our family trip to Cali by stopping in Vegas to take the whole family to eat. There was a 45 minute wait...we kind of expected it, we were seated and had already looked at menu's to order. The waiter was shouting over the music from the end of the table, like his feet were glued to the floor. The drinks arrived 15 minutes later, in paper cups, no lids. The food came another 25 minutes after that. My son's mac n cheese came with a hair. The staff was all bunched up together at the ends of the booth rows hovering in anticipation of a table leaving. I had to get up and find our waiter to get help. We refilled our own drinks, didn't see the waiter again until we asked for the check. P.S. We were given the choice of 18 or 20 percent tip...for no service. The second we moved our chairs an inch,  the hovering staff swarmed the table to clear it. Giant fans of the family. Giant disappointment.",1
"The waitress and wait staff were wonderful. However, the management asked us to get up and leave after they thought we were only in the restaurant for a to-go order, so they kicked us out of a booth... That we were sitting in as a group. All we wanted to do was rest our feet and eat a burger... :(",2
Finally got to stop at a Wahlburgers!!!!,5
Delicious is all I can say!!! Can't wait to go back..,4
"Burgers very greasy and no flavour whatsoever.
Very expensive as well for what you are getting, two burgers, two drinks and one side of fries $65 including tax & tip!
I would never go again but service was good.",3
Usually a great franchise. This 1 missed the Mark.,3
Good food but terrible service. The host threw our menus down and walked away without speaking a word.,3
"Bottomline, their burgers are good, not exceptional, but way to pricey.  For $12.95 you get an average size BBQ Burger, and that's it!  No fries or anything else. The fries will cost you another $4.95.  I know they are on the Strip but so is In n Out, which is just a short distance north of this location on the same side of the Strip.  At In n Out you can get an awesome burger, fries and a drink for about $7 !!!! And at a great location in The Linq.",2
The food was mostly all right. Nothing special but a pretty good burger,3
Seasoned burgers and fries were fresh. Good eating...,5
Good food and Great service. The wahlburger sauce is good even on fries,5
"My husband and I went there last Saturday when they first open for the day. Service was great. Food was greasy and cold. What we dislike was the cooks putting the food on the counter and before our server could give it to us a lady standing behind the counter was pulling the sandwiches apart to make sure they were cook right. She was wearing gloves but did not change them between touching beef, chicken and mine which was a raw ground turkey burger. We will not be going back. We were very disappointed.",1
"Good food and great atmosphere.  Food was worth the wait. Some waiters are rude, but most of them are great.",3
Burger was good with the American government cheese. The fries were soggy and expensive. Servicer was attentive. Ok to visit once. I don't plan on going back even thou I am a big fan of Paul.,3
"Alexandria was our server. She was extremely personalble, gave outstanding recommendations as well as great conversation throughout the meal! I would say best service in Vegas thus far!!!",5
"Good food, decent size portions, and prices were not inflated.",5
Love it!!,5
"Mark Wahlburg (aka Markie Mark) started this burger chain as an insurance for later... The place has excellent burgers, great servers and even has choices for vegan/vegetarians. So the whole family can have a great meal. The chairs however... Mark, spend some of your dollars to get something with a little comfort!",4
"Thought the burgers were great! Definitely going to put Wahlburgers on the rotation! Went not expecting much, but damn they were good!!",5
Fantastically tasty burgers! The local beers were really good and the bartender helped me pick out my favorite on the first try.,5
I ordered fiesta burger and Yukon fries with lemonade. Everything exceeded expectations. The drink was the best and quenching. The bbq sauce was new and good and light and curious what's in it.,5
"Good prices, good food, salad bowl was ok but the burgers wow",4
"LOVE Wahlburgers!!! Great food, great service. When we visit Las Vegas it's a must on the to-do list.",5
Love it here!!  Ever time we are in vegas we make a stop here.  Staff is great.   I waited for a long time for them to open but the wait was great.,5
"Good food not great for the price, but the sweet potatoes tots are pretty bomb.",3
Megan n I both got the our Burger which said it was a 1/3 lb Burger whichis not true because I grew up raising cattle and our have 1/3 lb patties sitting at home in my freezer. Super small patties for the price and not actual size. Got food before I even got our waters which we had to ask again. Signature Sauce was so small amount on patty that I couldn't even taste it. Overall food taste good but sizes are wrong and price is over rated for not coming in a actually meal.,2
Really good enjoyed my burger and so did my family was soo excited to eat here at Wahlburgers.,5
"Our server Miguel was awesome!
Picture lady gave us the ""Stink Eye"" when we didn't buy family photo.
Food was great, will return next time in LV.",5
Amazing,5
"Great experience there, great food and good environment",5
Good food. Nice waiters. Will try again.,5
"My new favorite restaurant,  friendly staff, loved the experience.",5
"Very high quality food prep with creative additions to basic recipes. Personable, efficient staff.",5
the smell in the area made me sick. had to take food back to room to eat it. but it was good,3
"Stopped for lunch, had the bbq burger (Donnie's favorite).  The burger was great and the bun was fantastic!  The fries were ok, I probably should have gotten the tots or sweet potato tots instead. Overall, great experience, even though the location isn't ideal.",5
Blah taste.  Didn't get what I ordered.  Not a fan.  Sorry Marky mark.  Stick to acting.  3 times the price of In-n-out burger and no where near as good.  Not returning.,2
Omg the food was great!! Nothing like an old style juicy burger!,5
"It was ok. Not the best burger I've ever had, but clearly not the worst either. Friendly staff.  Cool environment. On the pricey side but then again you have to consider the area and the fact that everything in Vegas is pricey.",3
Dont ever hand me food that you say is glutin free. Then it's not. Then hand me a sandwich that is in half and everything is only one one half. What am I to do with bread..,1
"What a wonderful Wahlbergers experience!  We met Junior from Romania the general manager at the Las Vegas location and he was a delight and so appreciative we came for dinner.  Our dinners were so good and the service was fantastic.  The staff was so much fun and a pleasure to get to talk to.  Best wishes and continued success to Junior and his crew and the Wahlburger family.  Can't wait for another season of fun and laughs.

"Wasn't expecting much to begin with. Ordered the ""Our Burger"" it was maybe the best burger I've ever had. Staff was friendly as well!",5
"$$ prices not too bad.. food was really good, just outside Bally's downstairs in court yard",5
Burger and tots were excellent. Mac and cheese and onion rings were disappointing.,3
"What can I say - YES FIRST STOP ALWAYS - Love my WAHLBURGER.Actually took a friend who lives in Vegas, who had never been - Needless to say Shes going back 😉 PLEASE PLEASE COME TO ST.LOUIS AREA ---- WE LOVE YOU TOO 😍",5
Eating at my favorite restaurant today. This place rocks.,5
"First time here,  absolutely loved my hamburger! Best sauses too!!",5
"This is my new favorite burger place. Ice had five guys, in and out etc. 5 star for sure, definitely reccomend if you're a fan of burgers.",5
"This is my first time at a Wahlburgers.  I was looking for a burger joint in Vegas that was different than what I’ve had before.  Overall a good experience.  The bartender was friendly and on top of things for everyone.  They have a 1/3 lb burger, but I opted for the 9 oz burger (The Triple).  I was hoping for a burger with more flavor and that was my only disappointment.  Not sure I would make a point to come again, but I’m glad I came this time!",4
"Terrible experience.  Waited way too long,  price too high,  service was terrible",1
Wonderful time as always,5
"Friendly place, lots of Wahlburg movie and TV ""stuff,"" nice gluten free options.",5
So much fun. And the impossible burgers were amazing.,5
"I can't say enough good things about this place!!!! Not only could they accomodate gluten and dairy free but the food was awesome which is sometimes the trade off when you have dietary restrictions, but not here! Also, the service was really really really good!!! Thanks for an awesome experience wahlburgers. We can't wait to come back/visit other locations.",5
Good burgers. Little pricey but not bad for Vegas. Fair service.,3
"Not very good. It wasn't bad by any means, but considering the $12 cost for a burger (without fries, which are $5 more), the quality just wasn't there. It was just basic. If you want a good burger, head a little farther down the street to Gordon Ramsays Burger restaraunt inside Planet Hollywood. It's only about $2 more per burger, and it is a hundred times better.",3
"Too expensive for what it is. I was so excited to give this place a try, and was very disappointed. Burger King has more flavorful patties, and the special sauce tastes like a liquified hot dog.",2
"Really good food, good prices, and fast friendly service",5
Good chili. Pretty good classic burger. The impossible burger was very good.,4
"We arrived to find that there were no minors allowed at the bar. So we chose a tall table outside in the promenade, which was breezy and enjoyable. The waitress arrived promptly, and she was friendly and courteous. From the extensive list of family favorites on the menu, I chose Donnie’s favorite, the barbecue bacon burger. The bun was soft and flavorful, the beef patty was delicious, the Jalapeños were spicy but delicious, and the house barbecue sauce and avocado spread were the perfect pairing of condiments. I chose the fries as my side, and was not disappointed, because they were cooked to perfection; golden and crispy on the outside, perfectly soft on the inside, and without a trace of excess oil.
Would I go there again...? Most definitely, I plan to eat there tomorrow.",5
This place is awesome. The staff is on point and the food is amazing. A++,5
"The food was good,minus the onion strings. The music is way to loud . service was good for being so busy. Little pricy of a burger though that doesn't even come,with a side. All in all it was okay. Plenty other places to go to for better prices and more food though.",3
"Loved the burgers and the mac n cheese. Location was nice. Staff was efficient and friendly. A little pricey, but hey, its vegas baby!",5
"What an extraordinary place. The burgers are delicious, and staff extremely nice. Will definitely return.",5
"A large group and myself ate at Wahlburgers tonight around 530! Service was just okay, but the food was absolutely amazing. Every one in my group ordered different burgers but the one thing that we agreed on was that is was AMAZING! I am already planning on going back the next day and trying the sloppy Joe!!!",5
Vegas inflation kept the rating down but burgers were delicious,3
"I had the bbq bacon burger, tator tots, mac n cheese, and a cherry coke...all were great...bonus: you get your soda in a souvenir cup",5
"Don't understand the hype, had the BBQ burger and it was an extremely average burger. Wouldn't go again, reminded me of fast food which I dont eat. I got my tater tots 16 minutes after I got my burger, which I had already finished. The whole hour we were here we were only asked once how we were.",2
"This is the infamous hamburger joint co-owned by Mark Whalberg and two of his brothers.  The hamburgers and fries are good and if you order a fountain drink, you even get to keep the plastic souvenir cup!  This particular location isn't far from the Las Vegas strip, so parking isn't really an option.  It is quite lively and busy during lunch, dinner, and the evening hours.  It can get a little loud, but the atmosphere is still great and fun.  If you're ever nearby, you should definitely check it out!!  Just make sure you pack your souvenir cup safely, as mine cracked in my luggage home. 😢",5
Pretty good burgers and drinks at a casual spot. Nothing wow or bad. Just a burger joints.,4
Music across from restaurant way too loud. Food & service was excellent though.  They tried very hard to accommodate us.,4
"Quick friendly service, fresh Lettuce, crispy onion rings, yummy fries",5
"Very good, great service. Definitely get a burger but the tuna was also tasty. And you get free popcorn",4
Oh my heavens. This was a wonderful place to eat. The waiter was so personable and funny.,5
I have been to Vegas twice and we have eaten here TWICE and would definitely go back- The alcoholic shakes are a little pricey but the service was great and the burger/sandwich options are extensive. I recommend coming early to avoid long wait times and crowded dining room,4
Staff is fast and friendly. The food was not that good. I had the chicken tenders and tots. Chicken had NO flavor. The ranch dressing had a funky taste to it and the tots could have been cooked longer.,3
Burger was alright but in my opinion it was too much for the priceand about the experience the service was great and the staff was friendly.,4
Burgers are soooooooooooooooooooooo delicious as well as their fries and Buffalo and Sriracha sauce.,5
The service here was fast and food was good. No complaints,5
Food was good but everything came out on the cold side. Tasted great and service was excellent so I’ll recommend.,3
"Great burger, excellent service, and good wine. Very glad I stopped in.

And if you ever have a chance, try the Irish Pick-Me-Up (a lovely alcoholic milkshake).",5
"Just ate at Wahlbergers in Vegas.  Burger was good , the first cup of tots were cold, sent them back.  The second cup of tots were barely warm. Just left them on the table and was not even asked if there was a problem. Disappointed.",2
"Best gluten free bun on Jenny’ chicken! Yum! Vegan hubs had veg burger, happy couple! Great service.",5
"Always a great dining experience. Friendly staff, hot and fast food, delicious burgers!",5
"We entered the restaurant Sunday (the night of the terrible shooting) and were seated promptly. Just as we were ordering someone came in shouting there was a shooter just outside the restaurant. It is located in front of Bally's on the strip.  The bartenders started yelling ""Everyone down"". We all hit the floor and they immediately  locked the door. We were on the floor for about 3 minutes and the staff started yelling ""Everyone up and follow us"".  We were taken back through the kitchen into an enclosed room behind it and told to stay there and not open the door for anyone. The report of a shooter out front proved to be incorrect and we were able to leave in about 30 minutes.  But...... the point is this. Whoever trained the staff did an incredible job and the staff was nothing short of life saving. We never got to eat there but we are in debt to the wonderful staff who knew what to do in an extreme situation and would have saved many lives had it been true. Thanks bartenders and waiters.  Being from Boston we will would like to thank the Wahlburgers personally.",5
Great experience. Food was delicious 😁,5
I had the Beast hamburgers and fries. The burger was moist and flavorful. I sat at the bar. It was a tight squeeze. Very loud and there are no bathrooms in the restaurant. You have to go outside and around the corner but after all that and 25 bucks later I'd come back.,3
Great hospitality and burger was delicious,5
I watch the TV show and wanted to try the food.  It was just as excellent as they say it is on the show.,5
Good food. Fair prices.,4
So good we went back and enjoyed it even more. I always have the our burger and 50/50 tots/fries and the best coffee frappe not served in MA. If you can and the weather permits try and get a table outdoors. We'll be back,5
Egg-cellent breakfast burger... The fries stayed crispy throughout the meal. Very good waiter.,5
"Let’s just say way over priced & the food/drinks on the menu is average! Had fast food burgers taste better. Just cause it’s Vegas doesn’t justify the $, had cheaper food & drinks in Vegas that put this place to shame! Go to Red Robin, so much better food, drinks, & service at half the price! And yes, the service sucked!!",1
The food is amazing! Some of the best hamburgers I've ever had,5
Went with my female friend after a long hard day at work and the burgers were delicious!,5
"Excellent burger and fries, service speed was great, only a bit pricey keeps it from 5 stars.",4
Not going to lie to you kid i expected this not to live up to the hype but man was i wrong. Amazing,5
Excellent burgers for a good price. Drinks could be a little stronger for the price though.,4
Lovely experience. Although my burger was a dry... the mark Whalberg turkey and stuffing burger. My husband got the Danny Whalberg nice . Kept my cocktail cup as a souvenir,4
"Burger was very delicious,  but fries not fresh cold when brought to our table...still ate it ...would have been perfect freshly cook n serve",4
Extremely overpriced compared to every other location. Poor service extremely small portion sizes I will not waste my time or money going back there,2
Really delicious burgers! I almost inhaled mine.,5
"We went their after a long day of touring, every one was tired. Didn't help that there was a very loud (and drunk) group next to our table which made it nearly impossible to understand each other.
Burgers were ok but nothing special.",3
It definitely wasn't what I thought it was. I'd definitely eat Fatburger over Wahlburgers.,3
"It was honestly one of the best burgers my wife and I have had 🍔 The only issue now is, we are home and craving it but would have to drive 10 hours to get another one!",5
By far the freshest burger and produce I have ever enjoyed from a restaurant. I expected a lot of hype. But no. It's amazing,5
Burgers are Delicious price is fair service was good,4
Went there on a date. Didn’t even finish our food. The Mac and cheese hardly has any cheese on it. Wow. Overpriced too.,2
"Great spot for a drink, & great burger selection. Our waitress was awesome, & gave us good recommendation for site seeing.",5
"So so... So expensive, so slow, and yes, burgers are not bad, but not good either.
Wendy's is less expensive, and really better.",2
"After disappointing lack of service at the outside pizza restaurant, came over here for a quick bite. They had us seated and served within 15 minutes which was fantastic, even if it was only drinks and tots we ordered.",5
"Great food, great staff, & great prices!!!",5
"At least we got to keep the green logo cups?!

Food was average at best. The burger was so covered in cheese and sauce you couldn't even taste the burger itself. The sloppy Joe was nothing more than chili on a soggy piece of white bread. The best part of the meal was the side of regular pre-frozen, now soggy, tater tots.  We will never go back... or visit any other locations during our travels.",1
They had good atmosphere. But food was not good. Stale fries. Tried the Sloppy Joe. Man- wich was better as a kid.,1
Great tasting burgers and fries.  Onion rings were disappointing.  Gluten free options were good.,4
"Great burgers, great staff. What else is required. Keep it up.",5
Best burger ever....great service too our waitress Alex was excellent (especially serving my grandmother) catering to everyone’s needs. Will be coming back very soon.,5
"The menus were dirty and falling apart. Obnoxiously loud with horrible music. Tables facing the windows with no blinds so you have the sun in your eyes. Burger is bland, and dry(which is surprising since I ordered it rare.) My rare burger was cooked closer to a med well and couldn't even hold together. The Mac and cheese is greatly lacking in flavor. (Most likely since it's mostly made with American cheese). Everything comes in paper cups. Not a dish to be seen in the dinning room. Be on ordering our food we didn't see our server till the check. No name tags on the wait staff and the server never introduced himself. One of the worst dinning experiences I have ever had. The Wahlbergs should be ashamed to have their name on this sorry excuse of a restaurant.",1
Food and atmosphere were good.  Prices not bad for being so close to the Strip.,4
It was ok.,3
Terrible service. Was very excited to try this burger joint. Won't be coming back to this particular location.,2
"I've read the couple negative reviews. I had the beast burger it was really good! The prices aren't even that bad! It's vegas, if you want to save money stay home! Ronnie was my bartender and he was great! Burger was two patties pulled pork and house made blue cheese, I would never order something like this but I'm glad I did it was different but good!! Going to make a trip out to Boston to eat at the original for sure!!",5
Took a little time for them to make the meals. but I heard from the Grapevine that they're trying to make a big effort on bringing down the time on delivery in their hamburgers. Great food must try,4
"My hubs and I are locals so when we venture down to the strip, it’s for a good reason! My dad came in from out of town and insisted on treating us to Wahlburgers. Four stars for the service and the quality of the food. I got the super melt burger subbed out with the Wahl sauce; it was almost perfect except for the temperature. Unfortunately there was a mixup in the kitchen and I got my husband’s medium rare patty and he got my medium well. I understand that mistakes happen, and our server was apologetic and more than willing to try to find a happy solution. I’m sure I’d be rating 5 stars if I hadn’t had to send my food back, the ingredients are all very fresh and worth the hype! I would definitely recommend this establishment and I intend to give it another try.",4
Looooved the experience. Great food. Amazing people who work there,5
Good place for a quick bite. The patty melt was really good,4
Went to the Wahlburger in Las Vegas and it was really good. The turkey burger was delicious.,4
We watch the show it was on my daughters bucket list to eat at Wahlburgers. found the food to be very good I ate PAUL‘s recommendation and it was fantastic! Thanks for entertaining us as well as feeding us well!,5
Would get 5 stars if priced a bit more in line with other specialty burger joints.,4
"We weren’t hungry, but my wife and I wanted to eat at Wahlburgers. I just ordered the chili, when I received it, I asked the waitress for crackers. Cause I ALWAYS have crackers with my chili. Anywhere I go that has chili, USUALLY has crackers. The waitress was very rude to me about having no crackers for my chili. I paid $5 for my collectible Walburger cup and $5 for my chili, and $5 for my wife’s Mac n bacon..... I sent my chili back, and then the waitress was surprised at “what was wrong?” I said, Think about it.... no tip for her! I love your movies Mark Walhberg, especially when you starred in 8 mile.",1
Food amazing .,5
Burger was AMAZING as were the sweet potato tots! I ordered the OFD burger and my husband got the original house burger...both were well cooked and flavorful!,5
Thought it was a regular burger. Really got tired of the joint when they took my picture Ave asked if I wanted to buy a copy? I said no thanks my phone has plenty enough for free.,1
"Being married to a blockhead I have become an unofficial Donnie ""girl"".  I like his acting, I like his shows, etc.  However one thing I have come to expect is price gouging/exorbitant costs of attending a show that the fans for some reason pay.  This is certainly the business policy at the restaurant.  I am not downgrading Paul's ability to create interesting flavor combos of hamburgers for the chain however nearly $14 for a burger is insane.  Again, not to downgrade Paul but he ain't no Bobby Flay.  $72 (w/tip) for 2 sandwiches, an order of tots, and two drinks, seriously?!  If one of them was there pressing the flesh or cooking you might get away with that but on a regular day on the strip is a bit pricey.  I wish them all the best but I wont be returning no matter how much my wife stomps and screams.",3
The BEST BURGERS I HAVE IN LAST 12 YEARS,5
Good burger,5
Very delicious burger  enjoyed it. It was worth the money.,5
Food was great along with the service,5
"Just had lunch at Wahlburgers The staff,fast service, food was all amazing ! You'll not want to miss this place. I loved it . Thanks",5
Food was horrible dont waste your money nothing special,1
The place looks really nice friendly staff and we were able to get gluten free items. Great!,5
Ambiance was good.    Tater tots good.   Burger bun wa doughy,3
"Had the BBQ Bacon Burger, and the Thin Onion Rings! Very good! Great service from the guy who helped me! Felt at home, and got my belly full. Got a giggle eating a Wahlburger, at Whalburgers, while watching Whalburgers! Fan of the show, and the brothers! Big fan of Mark! The only thing that would have made it better is meeting them!",5
"At Wahlburgers now with my husband and two kids. The waiter ""Victor"" refused to let us order and kids meal and said we all had to order off the adult menu. I've never had anyone be so rude, won't be back!",1
Delicious food and friendly staff. Loved the turkey/thanksgiving burger.,4
Tasty but greasy. Enviorment was lacking.,3
Good food but pricey,4
Love this place...we're always excited to come here. Glad we live near by!,5
Best burger had in a long time.Service was good.,4
I’ve been burger spoiled! Very delicious and great service. Reasonable pricing for being in Vegas!,5
Best gluten free sandwich bread ever! (Soft & doesn't break) I'm definitely going to get another burger before I hit he road!,5
The burgers are expensive and nothing special about them. I am sad I wasted a meal in Vegas here cuz there are so many other good places in the area!,2
"So we came to Vegas for vacation & I was so excited to try this place. I'm a huge fan. My friend ordered his burger with my jalapenos. Unfortunately they brought it out TWICE with jalapenos. But I give it a 4 star bc the manager owned up to the mistake, tool the burger off our ticket, bought us another round of drinks AND gave us a 20% discount. Mistakes happen but how you fix them defines your character. Plus the food was AMAZING.",4
Great service and super delicious food,5
"Wonderful place to grab a quick bite, the Our Burger was real good!",5
Hands down the best burger sweet tea and onion straws in vegas,5
Great burgers...ordered how you like them...medium rare in my case!,5
"This location isn't as good as it used to be. I have been coming here for years for Veterans Day. Ordered the Chicken Parmesan as the Chicken Alfredo wasn't on the menu for Veterans. The salad was made from head lettuce which came in large chunks. The noodles were cold. The ice water was terrible. Is this what you're giving us Veterans now. Thanks but not thanks. I was a Food service Specialist in the UNITED STATES ARMY FOR 32 YEARS. Could have stayed home and cooked my own meal.. That you for your service. First photo is Olive Garden, the rest are meals I prepared. Thanks for the good years you gave us.",2
"Service and staff were ok but the food was horrible.  I ordered chicken marsala and the chicken is as bad as microwaveable chicken. It does not taste like real chicken. As soon as you cut into it, you'll know.

I didn't finish my food so I took it home and my husband confirmed my observation.  I didn't even tell him but when he said the chicken tastes weird, I agreed and this needs to be heard by customers and Olive Garden.",2
"It's Olive Garden. You can microwave better food at home for an eighth the price. When we arrived, we watched an employee walk back in the front door with two Safeway bags full of boxes of their generic brand pasta.
I would rather buy a picnic entirely at a gas station and then consume that food in the same gas station's bathroom than eat at this location again, so typical quality for an Olive Garden. Eat literally anywhere else if you can.",1
Great staff. Added a last minute item not originally ordered with a great attitude. Also the packaging of all the food was perfect. No spills. Neat. Will go back soon.,4
"Great service ,great food ,great  Environment
Family of 5  spend $100 for everything +tip
Highly  Recommend the  Toscana soup.
Reqly delisious",5
"The food was Amazing, Yes we had Salad, Bread Stick's   Minestrone soup,  Chicken marcella,  &  Raviolis..loved it....Oh yeah & we  Drink sangira Sangera huh would you call it can you call it sangria,  WOW that tasted yummy...🥰🥰🥰 Are  Waitress was fabulous...",5
"No wait time, we were seated immediately in a nice booth. I got the Shrimp Alfredo with a Strawberry White Chocolate Dolcini for home. Good, kind and attentive server.",5
"They didn’t follow the special instructions on the order, paid for a $8 salad to be made wrong. After removing the iceberg lettuce that the instructions said to leave out my wife has about a 1/3rd of the salad left. Some kitchen yahoo thinks it’s acceptable to throw giant uncut chunks of white lettuce, what should be kitchen scraps, into a salad that we paid to have eaten as served.",1
Food was good the waiter was kind of a dud. Service was good he just didn't have much of a personality,5
"I have a great experience everytime I come here. The soup and salad are a must for me everytime. Sometimes if there is not enough juice in the soup, just ask and they are good with accommodating you. The shrimp pasta was by far the best. I eat here often with family and sometimes by myself",5
"It's decent Italian American food. The lunch menu is priced well.

The service can be hit or miss. One day in you can have a server that is attentive and will refill your drinks. While on other days you can be left dry and thirsty with no refills.",3
"We had an excellent dinner and our server was just awesome! We went at 11 am, so it wasn't too busy, great place!",4
Place to go and take your family out to dinner and a wonderful place to order dinner and pick it up great service wonderful food as always you guys are great and awesome have a wonderful day,5
"Olive Garden rarely disappoints... And with unlimited Alfredo sauce, can you really go wrong?
I like that you can order appetizers and kids meals from the iPad on the table. It's also handy when you're ready to pay.
As for servers, I recommend Jon. He was so attentive and we always had everything we needed. I'd definitely ask for him again.",5
"Great service, great food 👏🏼 our server was really good and attentive. I think his name was Eros. Thanks !",5
I love this place ❤,5
Great as always! We did a last minute dine in dinner. They were very accommodating and everything was great! Sorry didn't photograph main course but the calamari and mozzerella sticks were fire!,5
My family and I went out for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon. This was the first time we have dined in with our children since COVID began more than a year ago. Myself my husband and our two kids. Service was great.,5
Our waiter was fantastic. Everything was perfect. We never had to ask for anything. He was on it. We had fun talking to him and I am very impressed with are waiter. Outstanding.,5
"For a Saturday night we were seated right away. All the staff was very friendly. Portions were good size, and of course your soup or salad and bread sticks were offered generously. Entrees were hot and delicious on warm plates. The vino went down nicely also. Very nice, casual Italian eatery.",4
"Dine-in experience. The wait time for 2 people was ~10 minutes on a Sunday which was amazing. The service was good but nothing exceptional or worth raving about. However, the food and drinks did come out at a reasonable time and refills weren't an issue. I had an amaretto sour which was surprisingly good as well as the chicken Alfredo and a soda which is always a classic, no complaints about the food. The waiting room is crowded and large parties can clog up the main lobby which is always a pain. Would definitely go back but for larger parties I recommend not going on Sunday.",4
Standard  Olive Garden  was seated  promptly the staff was attentive  and the food was  served  fast hot and tasty .just what you expect.,4
Love their shrimp alfredo and their salad!!!,5
"Our server, Dan, was absolutely amazing. That man deserves a raise. The food wasn't anything to write home about. Probably costs a bit more than it should for the quality.... But that server Dan... SUPER great!!",3
I wish I had remembered our servers name. She was awesome. Had a great dining experience. Excellent food.,5
"My Mom & I had a great time. Our server Ebony was great! The only reason that this isn't 5 stars, is because they didn't have my favorite dessert... the Lemon Cake available, so sad! It's fantastic!",4
"No such thing as bad Italian at Olive Garden...although I did have a waiter that spoke bad Italian! LOL!! My fav lunch is all you can eat salad, soup and bread sticks! Delizioso!!  Their classic lasagna is ""la perfezione"". Buon appetito!!",5
"So glad there is a place to grab a late dinner in this area. The servers were great, the food was good. Thank you for a great dining experience.",5
I love myself some olive garden the waiter was great had a good sense of humor the food as usual was nice and my cup never went empty. Thanks olive garden.,5
"Wonderful service, payment a bit odd with the tablet format but server helped out quickly and efficiently",4
"I dined in server was good but I got my whole order shoved down my throat..
No sooner was the salad on the table but my entire order was served .
Food kinda sucked resulted like it was reheated I'm a microwave.
There was no dining experience over here.",2
"Delicious as usual! My only complaint, they don't put enough sauce on the spaghetti and it is pretty garlicky.",5
"Staff was great! Host very friendly, said it'd be a 35 min wait, however called us 10 mins later. Service was was awesome and food was good and came quick. I will definitely be coming back 👍🏻",5
Food good as usual. Service was great. Had the all you can eat. I noticed that the soup bowls were smaller but it doesn't matter since it's all you can eat. First night out to a restaurant in 16 months. Good choice.,4
Best Olive Garden we have been to! Wait staff (Dan) was Awsome!! Food was Great... much better than other OG restaurants we have been to!,5
"We arrived around 10:30 a.m. having been told they didn't open till 11:00a.m. But to our surprise were allowed in. Seated quite quickly even being Mother's Day. Service was top notch. Courteous and well received by our waitress. She was what a customer wants when dining out. 5 Stars to Debra, our hostess",5
"Chicken and Shrimp Carbonara was good, but not enough for me, not impressed 😕",3
Food was ok.  Service was great.  Glad they have brought bad the unlimited breadsticks and Alfredo Sauce,5
"Friendly, courteous staff.  Delicious food. Very comfortable atmosphere.",5
"Nope, Nope, Nope....the menu is waaaaay to limited these days and the list of Salad Dressings being ONLY 4 ""Common""  types like French, Ranch, and Standard Italian...I don't know if it's just me but this menu was sooo much better I would say around 2014--16.  There's several things like a seafood type Stuffed Ravioli dish that's no longer there and some Alfredo dishes and maybe a soup or 2 missing as well. This wasn't fun at all.",2
"Service was very good, people were friendly, by the food was Olive Garden.  OK, not great.",4
Olive garden is always so relaxing and the waitress was so friendly and attentive I had soup salad salmon and every thing was delicious,5
Great experience service was fantastic and the food was served fast!,5
Great salad! Great breadsticks! Great ravioli! Great Lasagna! Great service!,5
"Great waitress Jenner good food had a super birthday thete,all were freindly",5
Yes Olive garden We ordered dinner drinks and appetizers when I say everything was out and piping hot within 15 minutes Wow !Amazing taste appearance and customer service this location is the best in this State 2 Thumbs Up,5
"They stay busy, but always have the order correct.",5
This is our first time going here. We were so impressed with the prompt service and how well our server took care of us as a family. Food was excellent and I honestly can't wait to go back.,5
"I really wish they had one on my side of town in Henderson.

Service is ok at best. 20 min wait and then 30 min at our table.  Not one person stopped to say hi offer drinks nothing.

Once we ordered we got the wrong
Order for my son. Which was a huge pain.  They did make it right and we got the correct order at no charge.

Egg plant Parmigiana is still really good and crispy the way I like it.

Mushroom Ravioli was nice cooked well.

In all we were there for 1.5 hours my wife mentioned I think that’s the longest we have ever been at Olive Garden.  And we have been to locations with 30+ people in our group.",3
"Our waitress was phenomenal and the food was great! I think our waitres' name was Rosa, we didn't wait long at any time from ordering, to getting our food and the check. Definitely recommend!",5
Everything was great just a little hot inside. But great staff delicious food and great wine. Even took a bottle home.,4
"Great food, wonderful service, I just wish the staff wouldn't use the word ""guys"" when there is a woman and a man coming to eat there. It used to be they would treat you like a king and queen and call a couple folks. How would the men like it if we called everyone gal's? I'm a woman not a man. I'm not with a group of men. So treat people like king and queen...again...please",5
This place never fails when it comes to delicious food on a budget. Staff super friendly.,5
"Service was amazing. From the host taking us quickly to a table. To the very nice gentleman server whom gave us excellent service, great personality and Loved that he spoke spanish too. Food and drinks were delicious. ❤",5
Great food & service. Our waitress Stefany is great & super friendly!,5
Quality of service was excellent Take out order perfect  Is good job people,5
"We had a party of 8, they told us to sit down they would get our table ready.... they didnt told us the wait time.... 25 minutes later i ask how long more would it take they said 25 more minutes. worst costumer service ever.",1
"Foods always pretty average, but good pricing it you go and do deals. Server was awesome super sweet and quick. Seated really quick",5
"Food was good, service was slow.",3
"great food , lunch time you get good deals",5
Have not had in a long time !! But the food was Amazing!!,5
"Service was awful, we were massively rushed even though there were like 4 groups of people there (it was late on a monday night) the server told us ""shes not coming back to help"" I saw the people actually bring out the food more than the actual table runner. I tip really well, I'm always nice. I dont know what we did but apparently we peed in her soup or something. She gasped when we used the machine at the table to pay for dinner rather than hand her the card and get a receipt? On our way out we peeked at the kitchen, all the staff EXCEPT for the greeter there were in the little payment booth section just having a great time, I guess we interrupted them. I know it was labor day, I was prepared to drop a fat tip because I know how it is.

food 5/10 average for an olive garden
Service 0/10 didn't even try
Cleanliness 5/10 average for a restaurant

I go out of my way to recognize great employees not dwell on bad experiences but when a server says ""im not coming back, i dont normally work Mondays"" I'm done. This was a terrible experience and even if management reaches out, this review stays up.

Overall, save yourself the trouble and go to another restaurant.",1
Olive Garden is always super good. The customer service was great here! When we entered the door they asked our name for our reservation that we made over the phone and they lead us to our table in a matter of seconds. The food was very yummy and the amount they served us was perfect. They had hand sanitizing stations and when you enter they encourage you to sanitize just for our safety. I really recommend coming here.,5
Great and inexpensive food. Would eat there again!,5
"Everything was excellent, as soon as we walked in the door we were greeted and our server Eladio was very attentive checked on us constantly, the food was delicious starting with the bread sticks 😋 our appetizers, soup and salad. Our entrees were portioned large we couldn't even finish them",5
"We love coming during lunch on Saturdays for soup and salad. We ask for Jennette now, she's great!",5
"horrible customer service lady over the phone, we called in to ask how long the wait list. and the Mexican lady who was laughing out of no where told us that she can't determine the time to be seated. she can at least told us we could just walk in n be seated. she probably grow up being uneducated. so ill never go there now. I can't stand uneducated people who going to work there",1
"Hot and deliciously fresh food and super friendly staff, even for large crowds. Definitely worth the money on all counts.",5
Had good time at olive garden had spaghetti and chicken cutlet parmesgan...Ben had shrimp parmesgan and ate all love salad and bread stick and salad.it was fun,5
Love this Olive garden nothing but good customer service and great food,5
First time here but I loooove it overall service n food was great,5
"This amazing Olive Garden restaurant has amazing service, and kind staff. They were fast to welcome us, and care about their customers. Food was amazing, and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.",5
Soup and salad lunch.  Great!!!,5
First trip out to eat in a year and all I wanted was salad and breadsticks. Delicious! Exactly what the Dr ordered! Pleasant servers.,5
"Good experience, a moms outing to just catch up, chat, and eat! Fresh food! Our waiter Ty was on point, offered suggestions when needed, helpful, the place was clean, followed  COVID regulations. I would definitely go back!!! And the mango raspberry tea, salad, bread and calamari was so good!👅",4
My favorite item is not longer on the menu. Portobello stuffed ravioli. Tried the tour of Italy....was not thrilled. Service was great.,3
Fantastic server and great food.,5
I was there with I friend that I have known sence I was 6years old she was 7 and her daughter she found me on Facebook we have not seen each other for 58 years till this year she lives in Arkansas in California for vacation with her daughter great right she goes to California tomorrow miss her already so much food was great just Great!!!!,5
They did not bring out our soups at the same time in fact my daughter got her meal before her soup that we had to ask for. Plus had to ask for our breadsticks half way through our meal. This is the 2nd time in a row we have been given bad service. Last time we ended up just leaving because we couldn't even get to order our food after being seated for atleast 25 min with just a drink. Service needs to be better,2
"It's been a while but I'm so glad I went here. The salad is always the freshest. I got the tour of Italy, the chicken parmesan was absolutely delicious, the chicken crispy. The Alfredo sauce is always creamy and on point and the lasagna was meaty and filling with just the right amount of ricotta. The only downside is the sodium content in the food and the bread sticks need more garlic and butter",5
"always good... love the specialty teas, endless soup, salad, and breadsticks can't be beat!",5
"Our server Maria really made the experience worth while. She was quick, nice, and attentive. We had fun talking to her and having her as a waitress. She even decorated out plate for  our birthday girls.",5
"Lunch at olive garden is one of my favorite and most affordable! $13, for soup, salad, lemonade and free breadsticks. Debbies hospitality was phenomenal!",5
Great service and the food was really good,5
It was my first time at this location. Great experience. Great customer service. Will come back and bring the whole family.,4
"Went to lunch with my Mom & Sister..food was great, Our waiter Jesse had a great personality and was very attentive. Wonderful visit!",4
We enjoyed our selfs but the waiter only came one time for refills and it was when we was about to leave and the noodle portion sizes was off my kids got the samething one had way more noodle i got the seafood alfedo it was really good but i didnt have enough noodles in it,4
Great as usual. Service was great. Cannot remember servers name. She was great.  Omg to much food lol. Lunch for tomorrow.,5
"We haven't been to the Olive in years! Their breadsticks used to suck and so we stopped going, but today we went to dinner with the in laws and I dont know what they did to their breadsticks, but they were yummy! Lol  We had shrimp scampi, shrimp fettuccine, chicken carbonara, and steak. The food was good and the service was great! Super friendly, very clean location...We'll be back!! Happy eating y'all!",5
Greatest Italian food of all time!!!,5
Chicken Alfredo and highly recommend green apple sangria,5
"We made reservations a month ahead, for November 8.  we call  that we were going to be late 2, 3min then we got there at 8:04 and the guy insisted that we got there at 8:10 very rude he told us because we were late we had to wait. I understand that we were late but the acted very rude one if them even laugh. How ever the waitress and inside staff were great and polite.",4
I took my daughter here and she loved it,5
"Excellent waitress, I didn't ask her name but she was good",5
Food was cold and horrible.  Service was bad. Just a horrid experience,1
The shrimp scampi was AWESOME!! I love their salad. The calamari was also great! All around delightful experience 😄. Took home leftovers. Yum 😋,5
How can you beat the never ending soup and salad deal $8.99,5
"MARIA O. was great!!! She was friendly, funny, interactive on point. This lady had a beautiful energy and great personality. I would come here again and again as long as she’s is my server( not taking away from other people that are probably good too) but MARIA O. was just amazing. 1milli stars ⭐️",5
"Good food, good service.",5
Really good food. I love this place.,5
The waitress was rude and nasty right from the start not sure why.  Debbie t was her name,1
Excellent service. Good tasting food as usual. Full but felt very safe. Very clesn,5
Good Food Tasty Desserts 🍨,5
Awesome service. Great food. Will be back as always 😁,4
"My waitress Marisol was amazing! Went for a friends birthday, would recommend the Italian Margarita! Would not recommend the Mac and cheese! Great service and great serving sizes, would recommend for pasta lovers!",4
Well normally I love the OG but this experience was the worst I've had. First the vibe was off right when we walked in with the waitresses kind of bickering with each other and us getting slight attitude. Then my wife found what looked to be like a pubic hair in her soup and when we brought it to the waitresses attention she didn't seem to care much. Then we got the bill for the full amount and before we were gonna pay she took it back from us and took off my wife's meal. Super disappointing,1
"I go for the salad and breadsticks.  I can make better Italian food at home.  Somehow I w, my leftover breadsticks dissappear when my grandkids is around so, if I have the time, I make them at home.  Pretty good copycat recipes on line.",4
Love it me and my husband want to ot the staff and food was amazing,5
THE FOOD WAS GREAT AS ALWAYS. THE SERVICE WAS A LITTLE SLOW TO START OFF.,4
Love eating here with family or anyone definitely recommend to anyone that loves to eat Italian food or just likes to eat in general,5
"Awesome service. Good food. A little pricey.
Waitress was exceptional.",5
The lady was super nice with me i forgot her name food super good first tine i was there,5
"ABSOLUTE TERRIBLE ESTABLISHMINT!! My wife and I were celebrating our 14th anniversary. On this particular night, the workers made us wait 15 minutes after our reservation. When we finally got seated and started eating, the workers refused to serve my wife more breadsticks because ""she already had too many"" and im assuniming they only said that because my wife was slightly overweight. They scarred my wife for life and caused her so much emotional distress that she only eats mcdonalds and is 200 pounds overweight. Hire her a fitness coach or i will call corporate",1
Good friendly service and staff.  Shrimp scampi lunch was good.,4
"Easy online ordering and pretty seamless curbside pick up. Food was awesome of course. Only gave 4 stars because when I pulled up and checked in I was 17 minutes late and the message I received in response thanked me for ""checking in on time"" which I personally thought was funny but I could see people taking it as a condescending message haha. Just saying you guys might wanna fix that. Lmk when you do and I'll change my review 😁",4
The food just didn't taste good. The service is great but everything we ate (shrimp scampi and salad and soup) tasted like their salad dressing which is great for the salad but yucky in shrimp scampi.,3
It was busy and we still got great service. The food came fast and was amazing and so was our server!,5
"Fantastic Birthday Dinner for my granddaughter.  Hostess was very nice, helpful and attentive.  Thanks for everything.",4
Amazing service and great food. I. So glad they're now open until 11pm,5
Called in order when I tried to pick it up there was no order found out 2 people with similar names ordered mine went home with other person the restaurant expedited my food and I got it 15 minutes later they did give me free dessert for  my trouble,3
"Online order was perfect, done on time and delicious.",5
"I love their all you can eat, bread sticks, salad, and soups.",5
"Nice environment, friendly staff.
No major issues, it did take a long time to be greeted/seated/waited on.
When she finally did attend, Waitress was kind, professional and even allowed for a free sample of wine.
All things considered, it was an ok experience.",3
Great staff and yummy food.,5
Excellent Service good food.,5
food and service were good.,4
Food was great waiter on point with his service.,5
Food was good and service exceptional,4
no complaints! My waitress was very attentive and fast. I was very satisfied with my meal and service.,5
"It was okay, to be honest with you I'm a real Italian and this food is just not up to par. It's kind of like the McDonald's of Italian food if you ask me. Everything is just plain okay I mean if you're in a bind and you need to eat yeah you can go here but to be honest with you I would never pick this place is a place to go to the Italian food. There are so many amazing and incredible Italian restaurants out there run by real Italians that do it the right way I don't know why you would even choose this place. I think probably I'll never go back here but at least I tried it I gave it a shot I ate their lasagna, I ate their chicken parmesan, and I ate the Alfredo, it was all pretty good but just tasted ordinary there was nothing special about it.",3
Great service and the food was very good.  Love the $5 take home meals.,5
"Thank you Claudia and Marie for your fantastic service! The night of family surprises and love was perfect. The food was delicious. During these times, going out to eat with a big family is hard to do, but you all made it safe, fun, and a wonderful family dinner to remember-thank you also to Chris for setting up the evening.",5
"Lillianna is the best waitress we have ever had. She kept our soup and salad full, never had to ask for more water. She even left out the things we didn’t like in our salad!!! Highly recommend this restaurant and ask for Lillianna as your waitress.",5
Fast service.  Typical olive garden food.,4
"Waited over fifteen minutes after we were seated, no one ever came to even take our drink order. This was after we asked another server as well as used the ""Call Server"" button on the table kiosk. Very disappointed in the lack of customer service this evening, we left rather than wait any longer. Spoke with Manager Tom Wozniak as we were leaving. He apologized for our experience but made no attempt to make amends.",1
Food was great. Service was okay but not what I expect when paying $75 for dinner for 2 with no alcohol. Wasn't offered soda refill and not offered extra bread sticks. Waitress came by after the meal to pick up dirty dishes.,4
It's... An Olive Garden. Prices went up since the pandemic & I'm glad I had a gift card. Service was fine. Atmosphere was what you expect.,3
Took longer than they said. Food was luke warm. Thank goodness for microwaves. The food is still awesome,4
Super friendly staff via phone. I love that can join the waitlist online. Also Ty the server is amazing and goes above and beyond to give you great service. Our breadsticks were hot and the Alfredo was on point. IMO this is the best Olive Garden in Vegas - service and food is always good.,5
Scott was so amazinggg he was the best he stated conversations and sang happy bday to me he gave my brother a box of cheese cause he loves it so much haha he gave us extra chocolates they were amazing he re filled our drinks everytime they were empty he took/refilled our plates/bowels when they were gone Scott was the best,5
The spaghetti tastes like it's loaded with sugar. This is the absolute lowest of the barrel when it comes to italian food. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else.,1
"The waiter was fabulous, very helpful and was not pushy or over bothersome. Will continue to lunch there on a reg basis",5
AMAZING customer service. Food was fresh. Affordable lunch and dinner specials.,5
"Took my mom out for lunch and had great service,
The waiters name was Jesse and I just wanted to leave a good review, took very good care of us.",5
"Fantastic good food, great service and fast service, fair pricing on the menus, but you need to call ahead to make reservations even though it doesn't say that on its app. Plenty of parking space, and they do have curbside pickup where they bring the food out to you once you get there after you order it online. You can also order it over the telephone and they'll tell you when approximately the food will be  ready to be picked up. I would recommend this place on Charleston and nellis for fine food and good dining family friendly.",5
Great food and service as always,5
"Good food, easy to get to and from the parking area. Curbside is the best.",4
Our server Kesha was really really good and super nice. My aunt is always cranky and Kesha was fantastic with her. Food was hot and fresh. When I go back I will definitely ask for Kesha,5
Service was great breadsticks and salad for days. I'm on keto and the staff were very helpful in helping keep what I ordered keto friendly. I know right at Olive garden? I would go back there.,5
Yummy grand daughter loves the meatballs...,5
My waiter was very Curtis's and was great on seeing if we needed anything  I liked his attitude,5
"Nice joining of "" MY RETURN "" enjoy panomegah",5
The food was delicious and our server was awesome!!,5
"Called for information (7:20pm) on waiting time and the guy on the phone was extremely rude to my wife. I understand if you're busy but you have to make time for that or ask us to be put on hold instead of being unprofessional. My child was on the phone on bluetooth listening. And she even said ""That guy was rude"" She's 8. We called the one on decatur and got way better service.",1
"Delicious,  delicioso! I'm a fettuccine lover😍",5
Great service and food. Took home a $5 dinner after we had a Great dinner. I will be back!,5
"My top place for quality Italian food. Food was so fresh. There was fast, efficient, and courteous service.",5
"Excellent food, good portions of food, good service, and also one of the most beuatiful Olive Gardens I have seen :)",5
Great tasting lasagna and yummy salad Don't forget refreshing peach tea!,5
Great food and on top of bringing out our take out order,5
"Front greeter female was rude and made us wait longer than we had too. Even though we had a reservation. Walk in sat before us. But after we did get seated our server Rose was great. There are just some people dont and shouldn't be the first face or contact we receive. And point out i have been coming to this olive garden for a long time , like at least 20 years.",3
"Great service and love the endless soup, salad and breadsticks.",5
Never get enough of those breadsticks,5
"Good service, great soups/salads.
Quality of chicken wasn't great.",3
Great service Great food very accommodating👍,4
Food was good. Ordered online. Wait time was long so plan ahead.,5
"Last Tuesday my husband and I visited Olive Garden for a quick lunch. However,  the experience was not what I hoped for. First we were sat by the hostess stand and had to endure all their conversations during our meal. Then my tea tasted like coffee.  I had to convince my husband to go to Olive Garden with me because over the years we've always had bad experiences no matter what Olive Garden we ate at. I hope that the service gets better.",2
Shrimo/scallop scampi. Delicious. Timely. Servers polite,5
"We were here tonight and we had Rose as our server. She was so nice and attentive. We felt so welcomed by her and she made us feel like a priority to her. She’s the best! We’re from out of town, but if we’re ever back in Vegas, we’re coming back to this Olive Garden",5
Love the Charleston location,5
"My steak was overdone but it was still ok.
Need to put some items back on the menu like the Stuffed Chicken Marsala",4
Yummy.  Excellent food.,5
"The food was delicious and the waiter tried his best to keep us comfortable, his name was Mathias",4
Very good.  Great service,5
Even after checking in on line we waited 45 minutes for a table. After being seated we waited another 30 minutes for anyone to come to our table. All the while the wait staff was standing around and talking.  People who were seated in the same area saw someone who took their drink with in seconds of being seated. I even pressed the call server button and the manager looked at it and still no one came. Finally Ana who was not the server for our area came over and asked if she could get our drinks. Ana was the only good part of our entire visit. Will not go back to the olive garden on Nellis ever again. I wish Ana would find a different location to work at. Because even the manager at the Nellis location just stood there after seeing I had pressed the call server button. Would not recommend anyone go to this location.  They ruined Father's Day for my father.,1
"If Jay is not serving you don't even show up! Jay was absolutely amazing and so kind. They were funny and extremely helpful when olive garden was out of something at our table. Jay never gave a ""we don't have this sorry."" But instead gave ""we are out of this but might I recommend this, it is similar."" Thank you Jay for making my birthday dinner so much more amazing! I'll be back and I'll for sure only be asking for Jay.",5
"The food didn't taste that great and the general service was lacking. The workers didn't even seem to want to be there. I hadn't been to an Olive Garden in a while and, judging from this one, I don't think I'll go to one for a long time after this.",3
Food was awesome.  Marisol did a great job 5 stars for her,5
"Great food, patient waiters followed COVID-19 social distance protocols.",5
"Have tried calling around 8 times to place a SMALL order for pickup. One entrée and one drink, thats it.. Been talked to 5 out of the 8 times, and each time I was placed on hold for 10+ minutes which only ended with them hanging up on my after the wait... Highly Do not recommend. When I went a couple months prior in house,  the food quality was not the best, sad to see olive garden is no longer caring about customers. I will be eating elsewhere from here on out. So disappointed",1
"Appetizers, salad main course",4
Got order to go fast in and out. They were very polite.,5
"The food was good.  Our waitress was great.

The problem was, one of our party lost his wallet.  We called the store,  the person who answered the phone checked the lost and found.  She didn't or wouldn't go check the booth we sat in.   She told us to check back in a few days.

We went back and found the wallet.  I feel she should have checked the booth for us.",3
Delicious food. Plenty of space between tables. Prices were a little higher than I expected but still within reason.,4
"I've been here multiple times, I can always expect and receive the same service, which is great. All the staff is really attentive and the servers work with you to give you the best experience. The food is good, but is not fine Italian cuisine either, is just as any Olive Garden. I bet you know what to expect, and having that in mind this location doesn't disappoint.",4
"Our server was Cindy, I'm not one to really go to olive garden, I feel like I'm Italian and come from a big family it doesn't take that long to make pasta and serve a family for dinner. But today was my friends birthday and that's what she wanted. Surprisingly we didn't wait for a table we beat the rush and Cindy didn't forget anything our meal was great.",5
Amazingly good service and every time i have been they are always friendly and attentive. I've been around a year or so and can say they have definitely provided consistent and helpful service.,4
Always a good lunch of salad and soup.  Great service.,4
"Our hostess, Cindy was OUTSTANDING!! She was hustling the whole time my wife and I were there. It took a bit after we were seated to get drinks but after we did Jesse was on top of things for the rest of our meal. Well done.",4
It's ok i really only like going to get there soups 🍲 to me the rest of the food is just ok,3
Great experience! Very attentive service and food was great,5
LOVE THIS PLACE,5
"Rare treat, but well worth it for lunch.",4
Lilliana was our server and she was absolutely wonderful. Very welcoming and engaging service. She was a delight.,5
"Great dinner large portions and awesome waitress!
Well worth the time waiting for the reservation.",5
Wonderful service a lottle longer of a wait then i cared for but was worth it in the end!,5
Just not as good as it use to be. Dinners are to expense for what you get.,2
"Food and service was good, but $95 for lunch for 3? Its a bit much, I mean pasta is what? $0.59 a pound? Wont be back.",4
"Delicious food, nice atmosphere and friendly staff",5
"Tried calling to make a reservation, got told there’s no reservations. Then when tried to ask if they are busy the guy on the phone just hung up... might want to work on your phone etiquette and customer service.",1
"Rarely a good experience. My last visit, was more of the same. They seated my wife and I next to the server's station. I got to watch the servers work and listen to them converse with each other the entire time I ate my lunch. I've mentally given up on any Olive Garden. It just seems to be bad corporate culture. From Charleston, WV to Las Vegas, Nevada; still the same bad service.",1
"I love that is so clean and quiet, we were able to enjoy our meal and the staff was super friendly.",5
Amazing server from Washington.  We made reservations but still had to wait about 20 minutes.  Clean.,4
"Loved our food! Cheaper+more food compared to Cheesecake Factory. Server was very kind, breadsticks are always great!! 🤍🤍",5
Delicious food!  One of my favorite places.  Spaghetti is so good.  Tuscany soup is the bomb!,5
"Love the salad, bread and the pasta.",4
Our server she was the best,5
Made a reservation for birthday showed up at the time we set they told us that they we at capacity then let a party of 8 in instead of us will never visit this one again. Reservation means save a table. But not to these clowns.,1
It was ok. Serve served us all our food at once!!!🤔🙄😖 including soup and salad!!!🙄🤯🤔 Not cool at all!!!,3
Worst experience ever. The server was rude and so was the host. I will never visit this location ever again.,1

"They're doing ""rEsErVaTiOnS OnLy"" I'm assuming cause of the virus, but they me eat there anyway. The staff was professional and courteous.",4
"Good food, great service, friendly wonderful staff.",5
The food is amazing. Had a great time. The Server did an excellent job😁👍,5
"Awesome, first time there with him n I loved it",5
Went for a volleyball banquet. I had the new pasta nachos. They are good.,5
Great service! Loved my food!,4
I grew up going to this Olive Garden. My grandparents always took me here and I’ve had a wonderful experience. This Olive Garden location takes care if it’s long term customers. My grandma calls this place her other home because since my grandpa passed she comes here all the time and they always take care of her. I love this location and can’t wait to celebrate again here soon.,5
"The chicken was ok, & went downhill from there.  The soup was sooner watered, you could only taste the salt.  The two breadsticks were mini drumsticks.  We used to get the waiters attention to signal we wanted to leave.",1
Really great service! Loved the tour of Italy plate,4
I'm a kid my mom paid and it was yummy,5
My waitress was amazing and I'm sad I cannot recall her name!,5
Thanks to Olive Garden for the free Veterans day meal..,5
"Excellent customer service. Food was delicious. Plenty of parking. Not too busy on a Sunday afternoon, even with COVID restrictions.

You may remove your mask at the table but are asked to put it on should you stand up (e.g. bathrooms).",5
Went to order pasta stations for saturday conference meeting. It was the best choice. It was fantastic. Would do it again not time.,5
Lunch special is worth it! Calamari is great!! $5 Blue Hawaiian bomb.. missed my normal waitress today she is awesome,5
The food is Alr,3
"Love this place, food is delicious we really love how ROSIE was, she's very polite, thank you Rosie excellent customer service. I hope to come back soon. I really recommend this place.",5
This is a really good restaurant.,5
Thanks guys 👦jb,5
That was a great we ordered here. It was perfect and the waiter was really friendly and accommodating.,5
Great food great service  rose was sweet❤❤🍕🍕,5
Love the shrimp pasta love the lady she made us laugh so hard when she did put alot of cheese on my fiancee food but he loved it. Props to our waiter she deserves a promotion. Good customer service and she knows how to brighten peoples day. Thank u for holding the reserve for six,5
"Nice waitress, very friendly and helpful, but given too many tables by management. It took over 15 minutes to be served salad and bread. By the time the main course was served the salad was cold. Lol. The food was very good. Management you need to employ more staff. You are letting a good eatery down.",3
Great service. Good atmosphere . Food was very good. We were in on a cold day. Soup should have been serve warmer then usual .,5
Good service food always hot.,4
Cant even answer the phone when i call to make a reservation.,1
Great food and service!,5
"Consistently good food and great service.  If you're traveling and find an Olive Garden, you are assured of their consistency.  And if you're not pleased, tell the manager.  It's their job to fix things so you'll come back and bring your friends!",5
Typical Olive Garden chain. You know what you're going to get.,3
Food was great.  Waitress Jessica was very nice.,5
The food is different. they have lost a lot of quality,1
Great service every time i come,5
Salmon is awesome i get it every time I go there. Service is always grade A.,5
"Mikayla was our waitress and she was awesome, oh yeah and the food was good too lol.",5
My waitress was a hot mess. She brought the drinks first and when she passed my oldest daughter her drink she spilled it all over the table. She was overly flirtatious with my husband. She was really disrespectful passing food literally in front of our faces. And the quality of the food was really poor.I don't know if the chefs are different at different Olive garden's but this one was a complete disaster when I got my food it was  crunchy it was not even real good meat and it was a small tiny piece. And she gets on trying to talk to us like as if she were a part of the family and that in itself is not normal. I've positively absolutely indefinitely do not recommend this one.,1
"Before covid I spent a lot of time dinning @ the O"" .always  great 👍 food and service.",5
"The best place and the best food, it is full of great people very friendly and professional, made feel safe on pandemic protocol, I definitely recommend this place to everybody, kudos to them",5
Great as always.,5
"Table not cleaned. Some food under cooked. Paid electronically but rushed to do do while still eating my dinner. NOT APPRECIATED! I like good atmosphere and relaxation during my dinner. Not the Olive Garden I enjoyed in the past
So sad.",3
Good food. Nice people bring to car.,4
I just came from this Olive Garden after church. Well not even through the grace of God was a service any good it seems like it was a cattle call. Sit down look at the menu order eat your food and get out. The food portions or not that great I ordered never ending pasta or ravioli was dry then the shrimp and scallops were like 5 shrimp and maybe six scallops seems like they were child portions. The one I ordered the stuffed ravioli with fried shrimp I had a little bowl a little plate waitress was like distracted I asked her for extra bread she said I couldn't take it home that I could buy some if I wanted to I mean at this point it was like forget it just bring me my receipt I try to get the manager involved but he didn't seem to care in either well I recommend this place that's a big no. There are other Olive Gardens in the city there are a lot better seems like this one is always having issues with something.,2
"I loved it! My girlfriend and I went for Easter dinner. The service was great...friendly waiter, wait time reasonable and cozy comfortable atmosphere. I ordered from the list of specials...large stuffed shells with meat sauce. Awesome flavor had to take home quite a lot because the servings are huge. My friend had the chicken parmesan special...we tasted each other's dishes we both agree Exceptionally tasty.",5
Vinnie was the absolute BEST!!! This was a GREAT visit we had better than all the times we have come to eat here!!,5
"I went to the location on Nellis and Charleston & it was very lovely, great friendly staff but very poor service. It took way to long to be served our soups/ salads but the main courses came out fairly quick after the wait. I’m mostly giving 2 star rating bc I payed 20$ for a piece of salmon and broccoli that upset my stomach horribly. Iv been vomiting all day since I left the place. If you decide to go here do not order the salmon! :(",2
We ordered 2 small meals for 9.00 the server charged like a dinner big meal for 17.00..,2
"The food is always well-prepared.  It's the price that's too high. Even the appetizers are $13. If you're counting pennies,  this isn't the place to go.  If you have the money,  this is the best place to go.",3
"Food was cooked better than last time  I was there.
The breadsticks still are not as tasty as they used to be.",4
Always have great service that goes above and beyond everytime we eat there,5
"The food was really good and our waitress was nice. The Tour De Italy is the best thing on the menu. My friends and I were adventurous this time around and got new things. The lasagna dip is awesome, although I’ve had better artichoke dips at Applebee’s and I think Buffalo Wild Wings. The Chocolate Brownie Lasagna is also super good, but if you aren’t a fan of rich desserts I don’t recommend it.",5
Pricey but good,4
Came here for my mom's birthday.  Great service. Thank you.,5
Worst service ever. Our soup and salad were brought to our table before our beverages. We had to ask for our beverages even though we had given our beverage order shortly after we were seated. The Server claimed they thought they had brought our beverages already. Clearly since no beverages were on the table that was not the case. After the entrees were served our server asked if we needed anything else. I asked for a refill on our beverages which never happened. My glass was completely empty when I requested the refill. That is the short version of the issues we ran into. It was the middle of the afternoon. It wasn't busy. I noticed the other servers were being very attentive to their tables but not our server. This is the first time I had visited this Olive Garden in a few years because if the horrible service. I thought give it a shot...huge mistake and we won't be visiting this location ever again even if it is conveniently located.,1
"Went for lunch, food  and service was much better than expected.   Ms. Debbie was great!",5
"Really good Italian food, at least as I know it. A lot of changes lately, really heightened the ambiance and expanded the menu. A very nice dining experience...",5
"Always good food and nice waitress, enjoyed very much.",5
They've remodeled the place since the last time I went and things are looking great. I really like that they provide you with a touch screen machine that helps with getting the server's attention as well as providing entertainment. The service seems to have really improved as well. It was a great experience.,5
"Food is good but too expensive for what you get. My mom loves this place and I used to as well. I never go here anymore. The salads with half a tomato, 3 onion slices, and 4 olives is just ridiculous. The bread sticks now taste like generic bread, that was delivered frozen & then defrosted. The meals used to be large tasty portions. Now you wonder if they accidentally brought you a kids meal. Maybe if you’d offer cheap drinks we wouldn’t mind the downgrade.",3
For some reason drinks and food wasn't to my satisfaction?,2
Asia provided an outstanding service. She was very attentive towards us and made our experience fun. I definitely will be returning back because of her. I will request to be seated in her area.The food was very delicious. Thank you.,5
"Food was great, no complaints at all. Our waitress was fantastic! Very friendly and checked up on us frequent enough to ensure we were doing fine. Of the many Olive Garden restaurants I've been to over time, this one was the most pleasant. Highly recommend!",5
The chicken parmesano was excellent. The waiter was very good quite the best I've had in a long time. The rest of the service was good also.,5
Food was delicious and our server Stephanie was awesome,5
Took longer than expected ETA to get seated. Service was good. Food mediocre.,3
Good food and service,5
Came in and no hostest and no one waiting in lobby.  Waited a few minutes and a rude hostest came out with a shooing gesture for us to back up.  She answered the phone while we waited.  After getting off the phone she shoo us out saying no one can be on the lobby even though no one was there and there was plenty of distance between us and hostest.  She said to wait outside until she calls my name eventhough she had not ask for my name.  Obviously she didn't want my business so I left.  Will not be coming back.,1
"So I came here with my son for lunch. We had an enjoyable lunch. They were quick seating us. The waiter was excellent, he was quick and very attentive. The food was excellent, great chef's making the food. Decent prices as well, we will definitely come back and recommend it. It is very clean inside and we'll taken care of, plenty of parking.",5
"Experience was great, due to civid19 the menu is smaller but it does have all the favorite dishes.  Four of us when in and four of us left happy and satisfied.",5
Today is my mother's birthday and I couldn't make dinner due to working. I called and a woman by the name of Jeannette answered and I explained I couldn't make dinner but would love if they could sing happy birthday and bring her a dessert.  She took the time to take a brief description of my mom and who would be attending dinner.  She was able to identify them and assured me they would do so and let her know it was from me.  Sure enough about an hour and a half later my mom called me so happy they did it thanks to Jeanette and the server Nancy.  Thank u again guys for making the dinner amazing when I couldn't attend your the best!!!,5
Was crowded even though it was raining...food was good as usual service was a little slow guess it was because it was Valentine's day,5
I'm pretty sure the food will be great but they have no canopies outside for customers that are waiting in the blazing heat nor offering water bottles to patiently waiting customers and its over 100 degrees outside.,1
"I ordered by phone and picked up some stuffed shells, it went well with my steak. A little pricey but it would take too long to make at home. $18. It comes with a salad or soup and bread sticks.",4
I love coming to this Olive Garden. Been coming here for years. Everyone is always friendly and polite. I was happy today mostly because my server was super sweet and nice. She changed my total to a lesser one. I always get seated well since the girl who seats me knows I like a more secluded and quiet booth. The food is always super good! Hot and ready. Best place to come to eat on a rainy day !(:,5
Had to wait over an hour and then they sat us a dirty table which I actually had to request them to clean but my server was awesome and food was great so they still got to 3 bathrooms could have been cleaner.,3
Server number #6 shes incredible.,5
"Always good food, and great service.",5
I love the fact we have the option to get on the waitlist upon arrival. Everyone is very nice. Our server was rosie she provided excellent customer service.,5
Ate here today to celebrate my birthday and we had great food and the best service ever! Young man by the name of Ricky took care of us today and he was beyond amazing. I hope we get him next time we go.,5
Dining in was excellent and our friendly Server definitely going back soon!,5
We had some awesome food and service here. We also got a free dessert compliments of our waiter Erroll and his manager because we got married. Thanks you so much!,5
Food was good service great the food is always hot and tasty,5
It was nice to go back and have some good food. Have not been there in some time and only on special occasion my start going more often. Thank you for great food and service.,5
This is a good place to eat. The workers there are very nice and the food is really good. Although quite expensive. I recommend people to come there to eat. Whether its with family or friends. Or going out on a date. Highly recomend it.,5
Great service and super easy menu. Food tasty.,4
"They said there would be a 20 minute wait for a table, but we waited over an hour.  It was totally worth it.  The food was great, and our server was amazing.  Only down side is I got the unlimited pasta bowl and it took forever for the refills on it.  Still worth it.",4
It's OK if  You have a taste for Italian I had better,3
"I really love the food, especially the garlic bread and the moscato wine",5
"Horrible Experience!! Yolanda, the manager differently needs customer service re-training. Our salad  had brown lettuce and huge chunks of onions..when I complained she said that's how it always is and proceeded to tell me that they have used the same vendor for years. She never offered us a fresh salad!! She just took it away. Our waitress never offered us seconds on our soup..just took the empty bowl away..nor did she offer us cheese..The manager, I believe his name was Chris was very nice. He offered us desserts which was nice however the cheesecake was old and hard as a rock. He was nice and our lunch was at no charge..thank you for that. Will not go back to this location ever. Please re-train Yolanda I watched her with another unhappy customer and her customer service skills need improvement.
Thank you.",1
"Always fantastic service with hot food and clean silverware, what more could you ask for... thank you.",5
Love how they treated my family,4
I like 👍 lot this place.,5
Great service very good,5
Love the food there,5
Italian marguerita is so smooth I want another please,5
"Gone down hill. 5$ extra for sauces/dips. no mushrooms appetizer on the menu anymore 90$ for 2 people for this? I used to love olive garden when everyone else put them down, won't be going back.",2
Was great service gave us all the amenities needed and didnt over charge for extra bread,5
Amazing waiters and waitress. Very friendly and very fun to talk towards. Staff makes you feel at home and safe.,5
Love this place a lady by the of name Janette or Janet not sure but she was amazing love her to pieces ❤,5
"Our server , Debbie, was outstanding and an excellent server. The store was very accommodating to our 13 month old son. Thank you",4
"Our waiter tonight at the nellis location was Rosie. We ordered a liter of sparkling water, she brought it right away and poured it for us. (No one else had ever done that)
Everything we ordered she brought to us immediately, no wait at all. The bread sticks were warm and soft. (Usually they are cold)
She brought our food immediately.  She was kind. And everything we asked she did for us with a smile.
She was amazing. Even brought us a lot of chocolate.
She is now my favorite.  I wish more would learn from her talent of service. She was so thoughtful the whole time.
I just dont care for the fact a simple plate of lasagna is 20 dollars. But everything else is great.",4
We just love the food and service whether dine in or take out only one below par service,4
"Well, food is good. service is mediocre. Appetizer is late and stated that they will take it off from the bill. He came to the table apologized twice and still it was on the bill.... Paid for it and left.. Do not say anything at all. You just look bad...",3
My wife was reluctant to go telling me she might not like it but I convinced her since we were already in the parking lot lol.. We went in and the hostess and servers were more than attentive and nice they attended us really good we were offered various types of sample wines. And the salads and soups are very good ..I would highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone.. It's now my wife's favorite place to go and mine too..I have no complains about this place or any of its employees definitely a 10 out of 10,5
Would be a 5 but no stuffed mushrooms or Chicken Vino Blanco.,4
"Wow. Vinny completely won me back over to this location. I had a not so pleasant experience a year ago here and chose to avoid this place. I came as an invitee and had a great time. The service Vinny provided us completely caught me off guard and actually left me wanting to return once again.
Thank you.",5
"Wonderful food, environment, and service.",5
"We celebrated a birthday of our Dear friend on her 91st.
The staff was exceptional outstanding and funny. There wasn't anything they wouldn't do to improve this dinning experience.",5
"Good food
Great service.
This covid BS rules etc., areruining slot for everyone.
But good considering",4
Friendly Staff and delicious food :-P,5
"Always good to come here, the servers are very nice & friendly. Thank you",5
We all love this place in the family.  Great service,5
"Olive Garden the place for date night
Everything was great. Customer Service, food fun and fresh! Everyone works together so that you have a great dining experience. We love Olive Garden and it's freshness and atmospheric.",5
"Very clean , staff was very friendly, food was really good.  Service was  fast",4
"Was sat in bar area after calling in for wait list as website was not taking them.  Had both bartenders for servers.  I understood the wait at first then when it we were the only ones there service still was bad.  My food came out incorrect after I was asked for verification I did not want the  tomatoes  on top.  Food runner asked if it was correct as he heard the direction  given in kitchen.   I said no it was not correct.  No manager came over to apologize though she walked by a few times.  She glanced at us once going by, not enough to notice all were eating but me.  I tipped more than i should of, as it was not deserved.  We will not be returning at least to this location.  Tried to give them another chance, but should of gone elsewhere. Also do not add to your club points.",1
I was extremely disappointed! I ordered the shrimp and lobster mac and cheese. This dish was not worth the $20 price tag. It was nothing but pasta with 4 pieces of shrimp and a scrap of lobster with barely any sauce. The only saving grace of the order was the salad and breadsticks. I would not recommend the shrimp and lobster mac and cheese unless all you want is mostly plain pasta!,2
Great food and service,5
Olive garden is always good!,5
Poor quality food.,1
We loved the food and we will definitely come back.,5
"We were told it would only be a 15 minute wait but it ended up being well over a half hour. Then we waited forever for our food. We were there 2 hours total for the night. It ended up being because they were short staffed in the kitchen, and you can tell the employees were busting their butts trying to provide excellent service. And they really did everything they could to make things right after the long wait. I could tell the staff was working hard and I appreciate it",5
It's a great restaurant,5
"Great service under difficult circumstances with the virus etc...

Good food, and good wait staff.",5
"Our waitress was great. The food (we did the special) was so good and plentiful, leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  We were seated and served in record time.  This was our first visit to Olive Garden as we do not have one where we are from so this was a very nice dinner.",5
Close to my apartment they always treat us kindly. It is olive Garden you know what they offer food wise. If your craving some olive garden stop by. Usually pretty good about getting you seated fast.,5
"Great place!!! Jennifer our server was amazing, very lovely, recieved great customer service from her. The food delicious. Thank you!!!",5
Really kind employees I'm actually really impressed!! And the waits are insanely fast and they clean all surfaces off to avoid the spread of COVID-19!!,5
Great food,5
Food was too good definitely a nice place to go,5
"A $13.00 lunch and you take another portion home!!! Yes please! This offer is for a limited time. Nice minestrone soup, and don't ask how many breadsticks I had. 4 stars for this restaurant compared to others in its price range. My waiter was very attentive.",4
"This Olive Garden is located a couple miles away from our house, their staff is awesome, when we arrived our wait time was about ten minutes, the server Jonathan took care of us since the second we walked in, offered us two rounds of wine tasting. We ordered an appetizer of spinach dip, the manager of the day Kim took the time to kindly let us know that they had ran out and offered to take care of the bill for any other appetizer !! Awesome service Kim And Jonathan !!",5
"Went there for a late dinner on Friday. Food was excellent. But the real treasure here is Maria, our fabulous server! She was kind, friendly, energetic and a pure joy!
She is the reason we will be back...OFTEN!!!",5
If you want the best food & service this is the place. We have Visited 3 different restaurant's during our stay in the USA.. Highly recommend.,5
Food was great and out on time!,5
Excellent doorside service along with good food,5
"I am extremely satisfied with this location. From the moment we walked in we were greeted and only waited about 5 minutes for our table on a weekday. Hands down to our waiter Martel. Kind. Courteous, Knowledgeable. This employee made sure our experience was top notch. Definitely above average.",5
Went as a large group. They were very patient when we kept talking and waiting for the rest of the party to arrive.  I had the small shrimp scampi bowl. I had stuffed myself on bread and ended up taking it home. It reheated surprisingly well. Great service. We have a reservation to come back for our next gathering in another month.,5
Our server was terrific. The food isn't as good as I remember it but the salad and breadsticks were good. I liked the free refills on raspberry lemonade. I was so full when my actual dinner arrived that I took three bites and brought it home. It was good the next day.,4
Had a very nice dinner there friendly employees,4
Great food and GREAT atmosphere! Our waiter was excellent!! Even sang Happy Birthday with a free cheesecake (it was YUMMMM) for our 6 year old.....he was SUPER IMPRESSED!! Made him feel extra special. No disappointments here!!😀,5
I was very pleased with the  service and the food was great. Thank you,5
Unlimited soup and bread is my favorite!,5
The people are nice and clean it was fine,5
My new favorite restaurant,5
"They just open up, and have to wait outside when it's 110 degrees...for 10 to 15 minutes to be seated.",1
"Worst experience we've had at Olive garden. The waiter barely came so we never got to get extra bread sticks or salad, along with my wife's endless pasta and soup was offered to be filled up until we had to leave.",1
Very good food. Service was excellent!,5
"Food was perfect
Service was great",5
"Service was great but took forever to get the bill. Food was nice and hot and the drinks were kept full. All in all, for a chain, this location is worth going to.",4
I love this place great food,5
great service and good food.,5
Good Food and Great Great Service,5
Was ignored when I walked to the front,4
Great  Service always checking on you,4
"This location is nice and fairly clean. They had what I needed without any surprises. I was a little concerned prior to stopping. But, I was pleasantly surprised. Traffic is not as bad as I thought it might be. However, it could be because of the time if day that I stopped. Either way, traffic was not an issue. Everyone around the area was nice and I dis not feel uncomfortable at anytime.",5
It's all good. My youngest daughter n my grandkids ate my cold left overs. N loved it.  I had the chicken n shrimp Carabasa comes with noodles. Definite Repeat Performance.,5
"Service, quality of food, overall wait time for not only the food, but to get seated as well, was perfectly on point. A little pricey for their meals, but definitely worth it after I tasted my dinner! Wish I had room for desert, because their menu items  looked to die for!",5
"Our server Ray, was amazing! super polite , has great manners. absolutely loved him!  Food was delicious!!! Will definitely come back soon. THANK YOU RAY!",5
Great service and food.,5
Great food-unfortunately no spoon/fork/& the worst part no yummy chocolate mint!?,3
"I ordered the build your own pasta and ordered the whole grain pasta, but when she brought it, it was regular. The meal had a lot of oil in it so it felt very greasy and didn't set well on my stomach. Not very happy with it.",3
The waiter Monty and the great delicious food made it a great! He was a real entertainer. Presentation of the food was way out and beyond. Know I'll ask for him again. Wait if I need to. ☆☆☆☆☆,5
"Food was alright. Some things were better than others. Like on the buy one take one deal, my daughter ate raviolis there n they looked great n had a lot on the plate n lots of sauce n cheese on top. I had my raviolis to go. Way less raviolis n very little sauce n cheese on top. Ate at a different location today (Flamingo) n the portions were twice as big n plenty of toppings n extras. The Nellis location needs to step up their food.",3
I do not understand registering online but until you are there and is time running ???,1
The wait time 1 min the waiter was nice and the food was hot. I was surprised how good and fresh the bread sticks were and the salad was really good. So actually I filled up on that when I told my daughter b4 we sat down that I wasn't going 2 do that. So i ate a few bites of my order and had 2 take it home.,4
Was able to enjoy in-house dining with social distancing in place,5
"Don't come here Valentine's day expecting your online order to come out as scheduled. Not upset, I should've known better. Food was great and staff was super nice despite having to deal with the hungry ratchets. Lol",5
"Love the menu & food, never had a bad meal.  Clean & courtious staff.",5
Our waitress Lillianna was awesome.,5
The staff was okay. We didn't get a waiter for a bit longer than usual but made it up with extra wine and free dessert. The food was really good too.,4
good,4
"Food was delicious.
Lunch portions were just the right size.
Waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.",5
"Despite the prices being a tad High, food was very good. This location is old been here for a while, through the years have came here quite a bit. I just wish they had more of a option without so many items being fried or breaded.",4
I enjoy their food very much.  The service is  good.  Plus they're quick to make your meal. They do everything with consistency no matter where their located.,5
I ate it Olive garden the service was excellent the waiter he was outstanding the food was delicious. I had the fettuccine alfredo the lunch special it was very good the cook did an outstanding job the chef outstanding I would recommend it highly it was their lunch special and I would recommend it to everybody Olive garden. Their specials are just as good as the dinner.,5
"Great night, got lucky with a great server named Ricky! Food was good mojito was good checked on us, made sure we had drinks and food coming out in a timely manner for sure coming back to this location and asking for Ricky as our server",5
We love olive garden,5
"I enjoyed the food but found it difficult to get through the  ordering. Eventually called In to order out. And had difficulties with pick up as well. By time i got through the supposed simple process,  food cold and was missing part of order. But the food i did get was AWESOME! And i wont say i will not order again. Because,  how else will i know unless i give them a second shot? They could have had someone on training. Ill update the review if my second order/visit opposes this one.",4
I really enjoy coming here for dinner. I always get full off of the soup and bread sticks so I always have something to take home for later or another day. This location hasn't had bad wait times whenever I've gone (typically Friday evening).,5
"We shared a bad experience with our waiter that my family had on mother's day. Ramon {our waiter} was excellent! He apologized for our experience even though it wasn't is fault and treated my son and I wonderfully! We would definitely be asking for him again. Thank, Ramon, for a great time!",5
"Other than not being organized, I dont have a complaint  about the restaurant I just don't like these face mask rules, it doesn't make any sense.",5
"Wonderful atmosphere,  great food served fast and HOT!",5
Was open for a later dinner our waitress was attentive and friendly. Quiet seating area for our large family. Great service!,5
Great customer service our waiter was polite and attentive. And the food came quickly.,5
"Connor was a great waiter. Is very patient, nice, and friendly. We were there for my moms birthday and he was great to us. Will definitly come back because of him. He needs a raise! (:",5
Excellent server.,5
Classy and superb food,5
Great food. Great Service. In good company. Love it.,5
"I am very disappointed in the store and their service at 80 N Nellis in Las Vegas, Nv. I have been to a few Olive Garden  restaurants.  Due to being on a low sodium diet to fight heart disease. I was always able to substitute a bowl .of soup for the breadsticks that came with your pronto lunch. The breadsticks are too high in sodium. This is the only store that wouldn't allow it. Even though the service was excellent,  I will not do business with this store again. I recently had a pacemaker installed and too much sodium is not recommended for me. If this will change it's policy,I will more than happily bring my business  back. Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.  Stephen Polk",3
"I had the new Fried Stuffed Ziti endless pasta with Alfredo sauce.  I only had one bowl, but I really liked it.",4
Service is always amazing here. Nice change from normal chain restaurants.,5
Waitress so nice and kindly thanks,5
Service was good. Restaurant was clean. Nice to get out.,4
Just ordered a take out. The people who work there are always so friendly and patience while you decide. And the food is fantastic!!!!!!,5
Food was good the server was nice. But i felt rushed she was cut an hour ago so i felt like shr was trying to hurry us up. Like we were still eating n she came n started putting to go boxes,2
Dont even to call an place a order got put on hold three different times. They cannot hear anything your saying because there in the middle of the kitchen witch sounds like a middle school cafeteria. Then they try to make it seem like it's your fault was a regular will never go back......,2
This is a great restaurant and has great service the waitresses checked on us more than 5 times for our drinks and made sure our meals were right I will be going back here,5
"The food is delicious, but the Olive Garden on Nellis off Charleston really sucks wonder why well i'll give u a hint the service management the cooks, server's  Olive Garden is the best bur not the one on Nellis and Charleston",5
Not very good service. The front was all frantic and then the server was non existent at first then OVERLY attentive. But it's an olive garden not a chris ruth. Lol!,3
"Stopped @ 6pm for fast dinner; needed to get to Nellis AFB by 7pm. Dined in bar area & informed bar tender of my haste. Such a great staff.  By 6:30 I was out, tummy full, to-go box filled, & on my way!!",5
You know all of garden just doesn't make it for me the service was good the prices were outrageous for what you got the food is just so so. If you like all of garden it's a great place but the only thing I really like is the suits and the salad,3
"Lovely place, excellence, quality, taste, very efficient and friendly employees.  100% Guaranteed.  I'll be back soon.",5
VERY PRICEY -- BUT GOOD,5
"Cordial, polite, friendly, Covid 19 compliant... good food.",5
"So this place used to be a huge dump, to the point where Olive Garden was synonymous to getting a stomach ache. I don't know what they did but they really improved their service a lot. I ordered the Tour of Italy which combines the Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna Classico and Fettuccine Alfredo into one sampler plate. Usually when I go in big groups it takes forever to get the check. I waited up to 30 minutes one time. This time it only took less than 5. It looks like they upgraded their decor and got little machines where you can self check out. All in all a really good experience.",5
Eladio best server in this place ❤️,5
This is one of our favorite eateries!! Food is always good and our server Nancy is just great. Perfection,5
"Staff is unprofessional and rude especially the hostess that was seating Friday October 11 at 3:20-3:30 Repeating a question three times or thinking that being passive aggressive is purposeful is clearly going to escalate anyone that is paying money for a service/experience.

Hopefully someone retrains her on how to speak to Customers because she has poor customer service. We spoke to Debbie the manager who stated she would address the issue.

There is nothing personable about this location anymore, such a shame.",1
The server Jenn was amazing. She provided excellent service. I would definitely go back.,5
"The server was fast and attentive, the food was spectacular, and even the hostesses were pleasant! Definitely would recommend it!",5
"It's my favorite Italian restaurant, if I'm not cooking Italian myself as a former asst. Exec. Chef for Hilton. They have a huge menu, which I like to indulge in the never ending pasta and breadsticks. Food is always hot and fresh and some ingredients are locally sourced, fresh is best.",5
Awesome,5
I tried the oven baked pasta with shrimp and it was so delicious so now I'm going to try the other oven bake grilled chicken.,5
Eggplant parm was not served hot...spaghetti sauce same... Really disappointed,3
"Cleaned well before seating us, wore mask,  food was great and service was great aswell",5
Really bad food not wat I wanted this is my salad,1
Good food and service but limited menu due to the virus.,3
"Good location, great menu. The servers are polite and trained well. Value is good with few exceptions: soup a bit thin for the word ""creamy,"" linen table-
cloths would have met expectations,           and tip percentages based on things other than food a bit too high (eg, drinks and taxes, Do you really want to tip the government?). Highly recommended for location, service, menu, and atmosphere.",5
Excellent Service; Great Food! Went there for my friend's birthday..Nancy was our server..we will definitely be back..thank you for the Awesome experience!!,5
"We came here for my mother's birthday and had such a great time! John our server was friendly, nice, and just flat out amazing! We had a few good laughs with him! Thank you John for being sweet and making a bday dinner fun and memorable 😁",5
Restrooms were very clean and neat. But as for the young lady working the counter just as you enter the 2nd set of doors dropping a F BOMB as she spoke with her co-worker regarding his phone going off wasn't what I wanted to hear coming out of the restroom NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL. THANKS FOR LISTENING (6:11pm 5-23-2021 ),3
I have always loved the Olive Garden. I love their food it is always amazing. Although this one didn't offer more bread sticks after our first were eaten. If we had gotten a little better service then that would have gotten 5 stars.,4
Love love Olive Garden. Good is always amazing and to much for sure. Salad and soup and bread sticks always yummy. Served always pleasant,5
Italian food and the atmosphere at this spot is excellent. The service here is outstanding. It has a cool feel to it.,5
Food and service sucked. Will never eat here again. Me My husband and son got our food but my daughter in law waited 15 more minutes for her food. Then her and me could not eat our meals.,1
Amazing no lie not paid for real review. I eat at this location 2-3 times a week. I think I need to start a group for olive garden addiction it's the best seriously,5
My husband and I ate the lobster and shrimp mac and cheese. Our brother ate the chicken and shrimp plus he added lobster. All the food was amazing. Our Caramel Hazelnut Machiattos were great as well. The strawberry and passion fruit limonata had an awesome kick and we loved it. Our waiter Jeff was wonderful too. We definitely recommend this location.,5
My food was great!,5
"OG is not my favorite place to eat. But my wife likes it. My wife wanted to go and you know happy wife happy life. So we went.

We had almost no wait to be seated. Our server was a very nice young lady name Rain. The service was very good even after we passed on the wine. She was very helpful not pushy. The food was very good. They kept my glass full of ice tea and even brought me more yellow for my tea. It might be my best OG experience. I can't even remember now why I did not really care for this place but. It it moving up on my list of place to eat close to the house.",5
Always great service and fresh food at this location.,5
"I hate to say this but, I had a really bad experience here. My waitress acted like we were a inconvenience to her. When we asked for salad and breadsticks she made the comment that not enough people in are group wanted them and we would have to pay for them. She did not bring out are food other workers did, and we had to flag down other waitresses to get refills on are drinks. I have been to other olive gardens and never had a problem. She didn't even put are left overs in boxes, she just dropped off the to go boxes on the table. I didn't even want to leave a tip, but I know working in the food industry is not fun, but if she's unhappy maybe she should find other work.",1
I love this place. Sometimes you'll get a really good waiter that will make all the difference.,5
Olive garden has great customer service on Nellis Blvd. The never ending pasta bowl is the best deal there!,5
Love this place so much I end up eating myself sick.,4
Our server was amazing and so was the food,5
server britney was so rude and  never got a refill on my soda.. i like going here but probably wont go back for a while,2
"The lunch was edible, but not right. The  sauce that begins with a Pic... on the chicken was too salty. I would suggest to the ""cook"" that he adds another batch of sauce to it BEFORE the pesto is put in. That way he might be able to control the salinity.  I had asked for soft-cooked brokly (sp?), and got it. Unfortunately, it had been plated before the chicken and sauce was ready, so it was barely warm....BUT it was soft.",2
"We always try to sit at the bar when we can. John, the bartender/server is the best!",5
"John in the lounge is very friendly, conscientious, great server.  Foods good too.",5
Sometimes your prices are high the services fantastic the one we go to but I met my husband bear and I can't think of a better place to go than Olive Garden on our anniversary,5
SERVICE WAS GREAT,5
"Great service, great food,",5
Its OG what else can be said,3
Service was good as usual. The food was disappointing this time. My dinner was not hot & the salad was very disappointing.  It was soggy way to much dressing.,3
"The waiters there were so understaffed, or undertrained, that I kept getting rushed for my orders. They are impatient. They wouldn't give me a seat that had less lighting & put me in the middle of the room. My child has autism and started screaming from being near so many people. I kept getting looks (as if we don't get starred at enough!) The waiter made it worse by rushing me on literally everything, so I left!!! I had my fiancee pay the bill while I grabbed my child & left. The price is very high for the location and the service. The food isn't bad, but some is priced outrageously for the taste. That's just my personal opinion. Thanks for reading.",2
"italian food here - super tasty. Got there near six, it wasn't packed at all. Service is consistently good.",4
Awesome place to eat dinner with the family. Great customer service.,5
Thank you ..Ana was Awesome!! Welcome back..We appreciate you guys,5
Good location but always busy. Friendly staff. Foods always great. Their chocolate mouse dessert is fantastic.,5
"Food always good. Only rating for a 4 because they had the pay yourself on the table and I had someone else's bill for $99. When the server saw me staring hard at the bill (was looking at what I was charged to be that much), she came over and noticed I had someone else's. Great job for her but not everyone checks their bill. So, I could have easily paid for someone else and had to get it all fixed. So in other words, make sure your table has the right pay pad.",4
The food was ok but the service could be better,2
Great service!!! Tasty cocktails.  But food just not as great as it used to be.,3
"Tasty food at decent prices. If you want to go someplace with friendly atmosphere, with family or friends on a budget, olive garden is your place. This isn't a five star restaurant, but better than macaroni grill.",3
"Went out for dinner, the Lasagna Classico was the Bobby, couldn't eat it all, with the salad and breadsticks, it was great!!! Went to the location on Nellis n Charleston",5
Not to impressed with this place food was not that special and the prices seem high,3
The waiters take forever to get anything like the drinks it took about 20 min maybe because we had kids they think we don't tip or something idk but it was bad,2
Very good food & not that long of a wait,4
There was a wait even though no one was there,3
"Olive Garden is always a great place for great food. The servers are always friendly and fast. Though, I have spoken to a couple managers while trying to get a job there and I was very disappointed.
I got an email to set up an interview. When I got there, the woman was not rude by any means, but definitely not friendly. During the interview, she had to get up to deal with something. Which is perfectly fine because she is a manager and stuff happens. But she didn't even acknowledge me. She heard over the headset, said under her breath that she needs to deal with something, got up and left for a few minutes and just sat back down like nothing happened.
It was also an awkward interview. I feel like she knew she wasn't going to hire me as soon as she saw me, which is fine. But the entire interview consisted of her pretty much explaining what the company is like and what they expect and telling me that the other jobs on my resume are not like this. I had to almost interrupt to tell her anything about myself. Then she told me that I would be getting a second interview and I would get a phone call in 2-3 days to schedule. Five days passed, so I called and the manager I spoke to was extremely rude! She had so much attitude telling me I needed to call back when the other girl was there. I wish I got her name! I almost cried. Needless to say, I never got a second interview.

In closing, (lol) the food and service are great. I just hope you never need to come into contact with those 2 managers for any reason.",4
Food was over cooked and some under cooked. Server was amazing though. I wont go back to this location.,1
"Had the chicken/cheese piadina sandwich,  was decent, the pasta salad side dish tasted good but was barely 3 small bites on the plate. The server was so nice but so slow and forgetful, had to ask for things several times. Breadsticks were cold, bellini tea was kind of bitter",3
"To start off, my favorite I always get is the grilled pladina I really like it considering not eating meat anymore, well last week I had one bad experience everything was overcooked I sent a email back explaining what happened not complaining because I figured they'd probably just had a bad day cooking it probably was really really busy but management got back ahold of me immediately wanting to correct the situation I explained to them that it's not necessary I just want them to keep continuing given good service even when it's busy that's all but they still insisted on compensating me lol but I will still continue to go because I'm sprung on that sandwich lol",4
Great food good atmosphere very nice staff very clean,5
Awesome,5
Great service with Brittany and as always the food was amazing!!,5
"Had a fantastic Dinner for my Daughters Birthday. Had nothing but positive vibes, guest service and excellent food. Excellent place to dine and excellent service.",5
Moms birthday even tho they were busy they sang happy birthday to her it made it really special,5
Nice place to go back to. Grew up in the area and love the food. Getting in and out of the parking lot is not easy.,4
"Very organized,  great service, very safe environment clean and sanitize.",5
Sat at the bar with a cute bartender who poured a great drink. The buy one get one deal is too good to pass up!,5
"My server (I forgot her name, I'm horrible remembering names) was very welcoming and very helpful. I've never been to an Olive Garden before so she was all smiles as she helped me with selecting something from the menu. Again it was my first time there but definitely won't be my last and reading the reviews I see that many have had as great as experience as I did.",5
"Great service. This is one of the busier locations that I've been to, but the service is always great.",5
Great tasting meals,5
The food is delicioso 😋 and it's clean ❤️,5
"It was delicious. It was my first time. Only bad thing is i got a hair in my food... It's not the places fault but a customer was extremely rude to the waiter. :( i felt bad, but for us he was a perfect server in our eyes.",4
Service was mediocre. The salad was drowned in dressing the bloody mary made with terrible mix. And had none of the stuff it used too like celery and olives and the Lasagna was horrible it tasted like a frost bit Stouffer's.. And all the costumers we're all packed in oner corner the only real good thing wes the dinnee mint and my company,2
"Love the new waiting area, and remodel... great food as always. New booths are not comfortable...",5
the personals are very nice and polite,5
"Rude staff, cold food, charged full price instead of the lunch special.",2
"Exceptional waitress, skimpy on the food.
Paying $15.00 for a plate of pasta and mixed vegetables where the ingredients are worth $3.00 at the very most is not value for your money.",4
Laura was awesome for our server... food was excellent too!,5
"The food here is severely underwhelming.  For the price, I would expect at least decently flavorful meals but the food is pretty bland unfortunately.  Fast food italian is what this is and it shows.  Not to mention this particular location isn't as clean as one would expect.  Quite frankly I would be embarrassed to bring company to this place, maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I just expect more from a place that's supposed to have an air of fancy.",3
The service was the best I have had in a long time. U have to eat here. Lunch was cheap and filling,5
Our waitress was so kind. They hooked it up for my birthday and I appreciate it so much. I felt like the bread sticks weren't as garlicky as they could be but its good bread nonetheless.,5
First time I ever gave a restaurant a 5 Star .Came here last week for the first time.Me and my little family had a good time .Food arrived shortly the waiter was very friendly .Bathroom and restaurant is very clean. I recommend it ! Will be back again soon ! Thank you Olive Garden for a great experience.,5
"I loved the service very friendly and fast, the food was delicious as well",5
OMG day Ambience of Olive Garden at that location was very nice and we were fortunate to get a waiter that was very tentative to everything we needed and didn't need a very lovely he made our experience so nice I will go back again and I will recommend it to anyone,5
Food and experience was good,4
AMAZING FINE DINING VERY CLEAN/HAS A KIDS MENU AND DELICIOUS DESERTS. YEANI KNOW THE LONG LINE WAITING IS ALLOT BUT IT IS ALL WORTH IT ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR PLATE THE FOOD TASTES AMAZING AND IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOME FINE BREAD STICKS WELL THIS IS THE PLACE TO COME. ALSO IT HAS AN AMAZINGLY KIND STAFF,5
Loved my waiter ..older African American man. I forgot his name damn but he was great ..,5
No so far from the strip,4
"Great service always friendly! Food is always great,  love the free breadsticks and salad. The spinach artichoke dip with the little bread slices are to die for, the portions are big. Overall good place",5
I really like the service. The food is always great and on time. Nice and warm.,5
The food is always good. Servers always attentive,5
"I order to go at the bar the bartender was very polite and she also spoke Spanish which is beneficial since my mother was with me ,the atmosphere is nice seems like a close circle of employees. And you can never go wrong with the food it's always great guaranteed.",5
Its was good service was on the spot for the time there.,4
Always friendly and helpful staff. Food is consistent and very good,4
"Wonderful meal. Professional, and friendly staff!",5
The server was friendly and gave us great service. The lasagna is always delicious.,5
The service was good the waitress was prompt and made sure that we received our food was served as wwas ordered.,4
"We order to-go at least twice a month and the food is always hot, packed with the necessary utensils/add-ons and tastes delicious! The other day my husband picked up and they forgot one of our entrees....ahhh my husband had to drive 20 min back however they were very apologetic, kind and even gave us free dessert to make up for the inconvenience. 5 stars deserved!",5
"Spent my birthday at olive garden, vinny was my waiter and he was amazingly nice. I had an amazing birthday dinner thank you🙏😊",5
Can ALWAYS know you will have great meal & be treated with respect .,4
Service was very good. Food cooked to our request.  Staff always helpful. We are handicap and always treated well.,5

Fast service,4
Fast service. Not busy at the time I went. Food is reasonably priced.,4
Very clean. Nice staff. Not usually a long wait time. I love how quick our servers are too get our orders out and keep our drinks full.! (:,5
Excellent service by our server! I wish I could remember his name he was very courteous,5
Food was delicious but even with the value menu bill was a lil pricey,5
Even tho it was lunchtime and pretty busy visit was  great!,5
Quality food and service! Vinny is the best Waiter!,5
"Too long wait, almost two hours",1
Awful.  We ordered food to go.  They were supposed to bring our food to our vehicle.  We waited 30 min in our vehicle with 4 kids. Finally after calling them they finally brought our food out and they got our entire order wrong.  Didnt say sorry.  Nothing.. so we just left and we wont be coming back.,1
The greeters were great but my server was meh. The food was not really good and I don't plan on coming back. My wife liked the bread sticks though.,2
I really liked the place. It looks affluent like a fancy restaurant.,4
"Our Server Rose was so amazing. She was nice, accurate, quick and friendly. Will definitely go back to this location.",5
They were good they were so nice and helpful yoy should go its good.,5
Dinner was Awesome! The chef himself brought out our meals and was quite funny and sweet. The service was amazing as well.,5
Our server Chris was very helpful and defended the honor of my giant chicken parm by making sure it made it to my table despite another gentleman telling me I would never see it.,5
It's wonderful we always eat at the bar and the bartender John is wonderful he's very attentive no matter his one table or ten tables,5
"This place made my anniversary so special, between Noemy our server and are super nice buser, we had the best time, I recommend this to anyone who appreciates good food and good service!",5
"The food was great, however the service left me confused.",4
"Not surprising,  but the service was terrible, as was the food. The take out orders were wrong",1
Our waitress Debbie in the bar area was so wonderful! She made my Birthday celebration wonderful...thank you Debbie!,5
"Great food, good service, waiter said they nolonger serve tiramisu😢",4
Waitress was very entertaining.  The bar staff remembered us from a previous visit. They made my breadsticks extra brown like I love them.,5
"Our waitress, Sheila, was excellent and we tried new meal options that were very good. We had a good enjoyable meal and visit.",4
The manager here is nice and the service always on point,5
"Was excellent, good food and the people very nice cinco  estrellas",5
Very lovely. The waiter was very attentive and the food was amazing. I definitely recommend the Zuppa Toscana 💕 it was absolutely delightful!,5
Place is clean and the restaurant staffing is good plus good service and all you can eat salad and bread and soups but I'm not really happy with the flavor of the food. I'm going to tell them extra garlic next time I go,4
Great service,5
The food was excellent the service was excellent the waitress was excellent the whole meal was excellent thank you,5
"Fast service ,the food was really good drinks from the bar where awesome of course I couldn't finish my food I recommend coming hungry because the portions are huge",4
We order to go from this location a few times a year. The food is always good. Ready to pick up when they say to pick it up. No complaints about the take out!,5
Too pricey for basic food. Overrated,4
Music was too loud. When we asked if they could turn it down they turned it louder.,4
"Always loved this restaurant, but last couple of times have been disappointed. Tried the Canneloni and Seafood dish new to their menu this time--almost $20 and what a disappointment. The sauce was bland, shrimp overcooked, and of the 6 mussels on the plate, one was unopened and one empty. Iced tea was flavorless. Presentation was lacking. Gave them a 4 because service is still great and I'm hoping the last couple of experiences are not a trend.",4
"I could not be more pleased with the amazing service I was given at this restraunt by managnent and staff! Jennifer constable was a huge delight and I appreciate all she did for us! Her personality made the whole experience, you guys got a keeper!  I brought my family of 7 of here and there was not a disappointed eater! The food was absolutely amazing and came out with hot and quickly! Faculty was very clean and maintained and oh so accomidating to my 3 toddlers.
Thank you Yolanda lamb for your hard work in making this location all that it is!  The employees feed of your great vibe greeting an amazing experience for family dinning.",5
Very wonderful customer service our waiter Daniel showed excellent customer service,5
Excellent service. Janet did a great job,5
I had lunch there on my birthday. Good food. Good service,5
First time here and I love it. They are so nice and the  chef gave us a desert on the house. Definitely the place I recommend.,5
"Consistently good food, well managed and a responsive and very polite staff. It's what I've come to expect from Olive Garden; consistency!",5
good everything,5
The service was great! The food was yummy,5
"I was happy with our meal BUT, I was VERY unhappy about the fact that they do NOT offer a military discount. Now, don't misunderstand me, I don't go around expecting a military discount everywhere i go. Yet if when I walk into a restaurant and they have a framed certificate boasting how they ""We hire veterans/military!"" I do sort of expect a discount! Wouldn't you?
Shame on you Olive Garden.",1
"Was great, but was charged for a glass of wine I didn't have. The issue was fixed, but only after they watched the security footage to make sure I didn't have a glass. It was such an ordeal",3
"Three stars just because I’m a fan of Olive Garden, but takeout women Michele was rushed and kind of rude. Definitely felt kind of spoken down to. I had been asking questions about a discontinued dish and you could tell she was over it.",3
Its great American Italian foods. Reasonably priced. A large selection!,4
Sometimes the service is off but the restaurant is clean and the lunch special are good!,4
"The food & Service quality varies on how busy they are. This time it wasnt busy but service was ok, had to ask her for things like refills on water, salad and bread sticks. Food was cooked excellent.",3
Great food. Great service.,5
It's olive garden. Pretty standard location. Nothing much to say.,4
"First night went well where the manager came to our table, everyone was nice and food came quickly.

Literally the day after we came back and when we called to put in a reservation for two they person on the phone said they only do so 2 hours prior- amidst the fact the previous day we did it an hour prior. This day 1/27/2018 it was underwhelming. Breadsticks cold, server was not informing us of “secret” pricing such as the frittas were not 5.49 and to switch to Alfredo was 2.29. It’s not the price but rather not being informed of said price.

Rather unfortunate.",2
Service was a little slow. Food was great.,4
Our server Ty was amazing great service!!,5
Absolutely loved our experience. Our server was the best we've ever had at an olive garden! Thank you :),5
Great food and service and very affordable,4
Great service the food came out quick. The sangria was delicious,5
The food was sub par!!! Service good. Would not go to another one EVER!! VERY SALTY! Stuffed mushrooms were inedible!,1
Still love this place.  Never leave hungry or with an empty wallet lol.,5
Good food and really good service,4
Great customer service and accommodation.,5
"What a novel concept, Italian food that does not incorporate garlic in any dish. The best in bland dining...I have dined here numerous times and mentioned it each time to management and the best they can offer is a side of garlic powder to sprinkle on my food rather than have it cooked with the garlic. I have mentioned this at other Olive Garden restaurants around town and they are aware of it and equally befuddled. Don't dine at this one, drive a little farther to another one if you want Italian food that is cooked with garlic. This is valuable real estate better served for a business that knows how to do proper business. 4/24/19

{UPDATE: 6/24/19} It's been two months since I emailed OG at reviews@olivegarden.com with my full name​ and the location I visited, so far the right team has yet to reach out to me. Obviously the root of the problem extends far beyond this restaurant location.",1
"The food was good and the service was just okay. Our waiter was sick, she should have got the day off. she was coughing and sniffling the whole time. I watched her every step of the way to ensure she didnt do any of that over our food. But i felt sorry that she was in a position where she had to work and not take a day off.",3
It was definitely delicious and the service was amazing 5 stars,5
Great service by the staff for a retirement luncheon.  They took care of all the guests that showed for the event and we're very patient while we waited for late arrivals.,5
Love the food. Service is wonderful. Wait isn't too long.,5
Food is always delicious and is served immediately. I dont think it sits under the heat lamps for more than a minute or two. Perfect for date night.,5
I love the food there the service and a great crispy salads and the meatballs and the pasta and all the wonderful sauces. Great customer service always on top of it I highly recommend it,5
"Great food, better than most Olive gardens I have have gone too",5
Love eating here. Great service and great food!,5
"Same old same old, as is the usual from the OG. Same foods as always with just a slight twist in a few items to make them seem new. Funny thing, is that it works, OG has a following and very predictable business flows. Best time to eat at any olive garden is 3-4pm. Lowest guest counts in this hour with a high number of service staff per guest. Have an early dinner and no wait times at all your food will come quickly as well.",4
"Had to wait about 15 minutes for our seat. Once seated our waitress was very happy and friendly, my food on the other hand was not so great. My seafood chicken alfredo barley had any alfredo in it, super dry and had so little shrimp in it! The endless bread sticks were so overdone they were hard, and had a disgusting seasoning on them.",3
"Really BAD!, They brought me 3 times the wrong order, then I waited 20 more minutes and she forgot about us so we whent inside and had to reorder again and waited another 20 minutes and still my order was wrong and cold, try to avoid this olive garden. The guest look very unhappy and where also complainting about there food, I saw the waitress approaching the guest with a bad attitude!",1
"Lovely place, wonderful servers, food is amazing.",5
"Everything was great!! Our server, Josie, was very friendly. Had more than enough food",5
Great tasting Italian food. Fast & friendly waiters. Love the renovations done.,5
The food was amazing you can pay on the tablet even order your food and your kids can play on it,5
I love the food and staff here. Everyone is so nice and anytime I have eaten here it was a great experience.,5
Always good food and atmosphere. Servers are attentive and friendly.,5
"Absolute worst Olive Garden in Las Vegas
The service is beyond terrible",1
"Tyrell, our server, was awesome and friendly even with our kids asking a ton of questions.",5
Very good service every time we go and all employees are always friendly,4
"Food arrived quickly, host was very nice and attentive. My first time at Olive Garden in over 10 years, i'm glad i went back.",5
The most amazing customer service and outstanding meals.,5
It was amazing and kept the place nice and clean,5
Great customer service and food was delicious.,5
"I guess the servers were having a Bad day. We were snapped at twice by two different servers when we asked for a refill on our salad.  One was putting cheese on our soup and told us we had to ask our server for the salad,  so we asked the next person who brought items to our table who snapped the same response.... maybe servers should were different uniforms than waitresses or whoever so we can tell who we are supposed to ask for what? Probably won't be going back there again.  Too many other places to eat in Vegas...",3
It's all you can eat pasta again 🍝,5
The food here is amazing and the waiter here was awesome to my family and I. Definitely recommend this restaurant to your friends or family.,5
Good food . Great customer service !!,4
I've enjoyed dining at the Olive Garden for decades through out the Western states.It has always been consistently a very pleasant dining experience regardless of which state or city im in.Always!,3
Love this place.  I could live on their chicken fettuccine alfredo with the pasta e fagioli.,5
"We had a larger party of 10 but the service here was amazing as well as the breadsticks, sauce, and pasta dishes. We had salad and some had Zupa Toscana. I had Beef Brazzille with Pasta which was excellent.",5
The waitress was nice but it took way too long to get to-go boxes and way to long to bring the check and the change,2
I've only had one less than satisfactory experience at this location. The food is good the service is great and i would definitely suggest the shrimp scampi fritter any day. Zuppa Tuscana is always a good option as well,5
"Great service! The food is good, but there is the unfortunate problem of location. Only accessible going north bound on nellis. Also, this particular intersection is notorious for the smell of sewage for some reason.",3
Great Food and service. Fast and friendly Staff.,5
Good service and great food. Staff friendly.,5
Can never go wrong with the O.G,5
"I beg of Olive Garden to offer different types of salad greens, or at least another salad option that doesn't have iceberg lettuce, which everyone knows have absolutely no nutritional value!",4
Loved it awesome food and drinks 😍 I loved it so much keep up the good work guys,5
"This place is amazing I only rated it 4 stars as my parents had dishes with dry pasta and not enough sauce I personally loved my dish (seafood alfredo) but my parents dishes (the trio platter and the shrimp scampi) didnt have nearly enough sauce and the trio was dry, but all in all fabulous,over there salad and breadsticks cant wait to go again",4
Great service! Used car side delivery and had my food within minutes of letting them know I was in the parking lot! Hot food was hot and cold food was cold  when I made it home.,5
"Excellent place. Great people, good food and atmosphere.",5
Great service wonderful food best place to go they always ask you if you need anything else,5
"Absolute worst service ever. From the phone call before I came in to be ""waited on"", if that's what you want to call it. It was our first time coming here and I was rushed in ordering. I asked a few questions about the menu and the server kept talking to me like I'm stupid and she was so rude I can't believe she works in hospitality... So I just kept being kind to her but that didn't help better her attitude or service at all. I got asked if I wanted a water refill right before we Ieft. Lol. I'm not going to write everything that happened I just wish we stayed home it was a total waste of time and money. I wish I left no tip at all but couldn't do it. Hope she learns how to treat people...",1
My Favorite Place 💚 best food! Fabulous employees! Remember to tip!,5
Expensive and blah food,3
Always have a wonderful time here. Our waiter was seemingly new and nervous.  But we understood and everything turned out fine.,5
"Frienly, fast service and we enjoyed ourselves.",4
Had a great lunch with my family thank you for the wonderful service,5
Great food! But waitress seemed to have too many tables to show them all the attention that kind of priced meal deserves unfortunately.,4
"The service was great, our waiter was very nice and did a very good job.",5
Food is always great. Our server was THE best!,5
I love Italian food.  I only eat at Olive Garden.  They have the best Italian good and deserts.,5
"Can't go wrong at Olive Garden. Consistent good food, good selections, good service.",5
Good food and good prices for food.,5
"Enjoyed it. Very pleasant server, named Jessica.",5
I would give it zero stars if I could me and my wife was there for 30 min and didn't even get our order taken just our drinks and that was wrong we just got up and left and they didn't even notice very disappointing date night usually the service is great dont know what happened tonight the server needs to be retrain,1
The wine was good also the margaritas the chicken was really good well cooked and the pasta little over cooked but still enjoyable.,4
Awesome food. Awesome service. Definitely coming back!!,5
Service was a little slow but the food was good.,4
"Took long to get bread sticks, my food wasn't horrible  yet not very flavorful ( fish) Spaghetti was dry. They skimp on the meatballs as well as no free breads sticks with all meals only some. Breadsticks were ok but no seasoning only butter. No free sauce. That is extra. Overall experience felt a tad low budget. Waitress was nice and accommodating best to her ability. Manager was nice.",1
"Affordable Italian food, good for  date , night out.",5
Extremely excellent service unlimited soup salad and bread and they kept bringing it out large portions of food everything was delicious Olive Garden on Nellis Avenue it was awesome,5
"Seated quickly, waitress was so pleasant and attentive amd very personable. Made for a lovely luncheon experience with my daughter.",5
Aja J is an awesome server. Fast and the order was correct.,5
We always have a wonderful experience at this Olive Garden. We will definitely be back.,5
It was my wifes first time here we enjoyed our time here nothing but laughter and fun we had an awesome server I wish we would have chose a different meal that night though lol,4
"It was great loved the lunch menu, price was good. We had to flag down the water for water more times than we wanted to.",4
"We always eat too much because it endless soup and salad. We always get great service, too. Thus is not a place to go for a quiet dinner however because the volume level is high.",4
Great food and atmosphere. We go her a lot for family get togethers. Always treated well,5
"Service was good but food could be better, less frozen tasting.",4
This location is better than the 1 on decatur and charelston when it comes ti customer service and food.,4
"An oasis of good service with many staff members having worked there for many years. Food is similar to other Olive Gardens but in this part of town, a superior culinary experience .",5
Excellent staff that have to unfortunately serve poor quality food that tastes about like a microwave TV dinner and at absolutely ridiculous prices.,2
Went in on a holiday. Was sat quickly. Service was great and all of our food was spot on.,5
"I find it interesting that when I called to make a reservation, taking time to ask all my info, she stated you have to call more than 2 hours to make one, so she said she couldn't accept my reservation.... so I asked if it was busy. .. And she replied not really. .. OK then",3
food has gone downhill but the service is still good 3 stars for the food and 4 stars for service,4
Always great food and great customer service.. Isis is always a pleasure she's always so energetic an so friendly she has taken care of me the past few times I have called to order    ..thanks Isis,5

"Servers were awesome, they really made sure every things was perfect",5
Great food and quick service.,5
"We were seated right away. Service was great, the food was hot and very tasty.",5
"Called ahead before we got there around 5pm and was told there was no wait for a booth so I didn't need to put my name on the list. Get there about 12 minutes later and there is a 15-20 minute wait. Told the hostess we would like a booth. As we were waiting another couple walked in and was offered a booth in the bar. If we would of been offered that we definitely would of taken it. We had been waiting a while and the manager took us to a table. I let her know we had been waiting quite some time for a booth and didn't want a table. Their was two cleaned booths but she wouldn't seat us at either and walked us up back front to continue to wait. After a while we just decided to go sit in the bar. We put in an order for an appetizer on the ziosk. Right after the server came to take our food order and I asked her to please hold off on putting in our dinner order because we would like to have time to eat the appetizer. The appetizer took 25 minutes to come out. Our food came literally 30 seconds later. The chef who brought out our appetizer was the same person bringing out our food and he even said I know I just brought the appetizer but your food is ready. I kindly asked him to hold it back in the kitchen so we could have a moment to eat the appetizer. He came back two minutes later with our food again and then looked at us and said oh looks like you aren't finished with the appetizer I'll hold it again. This was frustrating because I specifically asked the server to wait to enter the dinner order. When our server came back with the dinners she said they had been remade but they definitely weren't, the noodles were extremely dried out probably from baking under the heat lamp for the last half hour. I had to ask for a water refill twice and it took 20 minutes to get it. Overall HORRIBLE service, will never return here again.",1
"Very good service,  food was great and staff very polite.",4
The food was good once I got it. I orseror on line in hope of getting my food so didn't have to rush to work. I was told was going to be  able to pick it up 25 minutes before work which allowed me plenty of time to run the food home to my family and get my stuff I needed for work However when I arrived there at the speciifed pick up time I was told my food is not ready and would be a xoucou more minutes. I was fine with a couple minutes. 20 minutes later still sitting in my car waiting for the food till I finally went in and said I was going to be late for work if didn't get my food now and I have been waiting 20 minutes. They brought out the wrong order. And finally 25 minutes after I got there I had the food and rushed home. I ended up making it to work just on time. Not sure would order on line again.,1
"It's a beautiful location, polite staff and of course, delicious well cooked food!",5

"Service is fine, but for the price the quality isn't up to par.  3 people with appetizers and dinner at $110+ is expensive for medicore food. Unlimited salad and bread sticks do not make a fine dinning experience.",3

Mmmmmmmmmm alfredo! Need I say more? Haha I did curbside pickup and it was delicious. So much easier than taking a toddler in the restaurant,5
Great friendly fast service. Food tasted great,5
The beessttt! Staff is always smiling and I like how they don't keep coming around 5 minutes and ask how's everything and within 10 minutes they are dropping off the check. They give us the check when we ask for it. Oh and that roscato.. wooww. Amazing.,5
Worst customer service experience ever . First it was a long wait to get my drink order started it was nothing it’s was a busy Sunday . After 20 minutes they took our food order okay finally .then we got our salad and soup and no breadsticks . After 15 mins me waiting for the sever to come  she tell me it’s a extra charge for salada d breadsticks! Since when ? I don’t mind paying we got our food and it was all wrong . Had to wait another 10 minutes for sever to come and tell her all she said was oh I forgot not even a sorry .. I waited more then 30 minutes to get my food back everyone in the table was already done yet had to take mine home . Like really I paid 90 dollars to take my food home .,1
Server was pleasant and food was fast but delicious!,4

My favorite  place..to dinner.i always have a great time in this restaurant.  Delicious  good..Amazing service,5
Bit concerned with an Italian resturant that does not have garlic cloves they quit ordering them several months ago. Also be aware of their buy one take one deal... More like.  Buy one take what they give you. Shame they can't keep the same quality they've had for years .  Guess they may be next in a long line of used to be's. Hope not.,3
Service was a little slow. Food was good. 2nd helping of breadsticks were cold and stale. Overall I like Olive garden and 1 not to good is not stopping me from coming back.,3

Food and service was wonderful,5
"Love the food and service. Highly recommend the soups, salads and breadsticks.",5
Service was great and  food delicious,5
You can never go wrong with Olive garden. It's our favorite restaurant. Always get a raapberry peach Bellini tea and mozerella sticks. Tour of italy or fetticune Alfredo are our go tos. Dip your bread sticks into the zuppa tuscana soup and you won't be disappointed. Wish soup and salad combo was cheaper because I never seem to eat enough salad to make it worth it,5
Great servers. Quality food. Wonderful experience!,5
Wonderful place to dine,5
"They have great prices , portions and service .",5
"My kids and I love Olive Garden and at this location the servers are great, always so nice and friendly. They keep the bread coming and always make sure u love what ur eating or drinking.

Btw, the servers always tell us we have such well behaved kids (I say: yeah, in public lol) and I give them props for being so patient and keeping their cool will.loud obnoxious kids.",5
"Love their food

Its lost its taste. Had tour of Italy & it was 2 spicy & chicken parmesan was hard & dried out. Its to commercial.,3
"The servers are great, the place is nice, the food is average",4
Delicious food,5
We hadn't been to Olive Garden in awhile and we truly appreciated our soup and salad dinner.  The food server was very attentive and the soups hit the spot!,5
"Enjoy the atmosphere, the half off wines and the server was really nice.",4
Great attentive service the tour of Italy was a very nice surprise and as always this salad was superb,5
Good food but expensive,5
The food is very good and the prices of moderate,4
It changed alot  the menu  not the same it's more expensive  now not enough shrimp in the shrimps  alfredo.,5
Delicious food good service and better hospitality,5
Never fails. Whatever the occasion it is.,5
Didn't like the pizza bowl. Tasted like they poured the salt shaker in it and the meat balls did not have that hamburger taste.,1
"Always nice and cozy, standard service. Only weird thing was that they no longer serve Caesar salad); Price is a bit high, but food is good.",4
What set it apart from other restaurants was the staff! The Waitresses were great very knowledgeable about their selections their portions were healthy and the food tasted great.,4
I'v been Eating at the Olive Garden  Rests for the last 15 Yrs..The food's good(u can't go wrong with the Soup&Salad and I usually take my main to go)prompt efficient service and reasonable prices..,4

Lots of great things to choose from and service was excellent,5
"The timing was right: the greeting was prompt, the service was commentable and the price was right. Thank you for and Enjoyable evening dinner!",4
The food is not what you think it is. Way too overpriced. The food doesn't taste Italian at all and the waitress the we had checked on is too often. They​ wanted us out of the restaurant as soon as possible which made this restaurant feel less like a restaurant. I'm not recommending this place.,3
"Service is good, but very noisy.  Hard to carry on conversation, there are always large tables of people overwhelming everyone else.",3
Very good service and excellent food.,5
"Went there with a gift card. We hadn't been there in quite a while but didn't miss anything. Was disappointed that they wanted to charge a la carte for soup, salads and breadsticks for lunch. Don't plan on going back anytime soon.",3
The atmosphere was awesome  food great as always,4
Great food and atmosphere.,5
I love their meat lasagna! Service is great!,4

One of my favorite places,5
"Today's service shined over any other service I've ever had at Olive Garden. My waitress today  was Casey B according to my receipt. I stopped eating at Olive Garden for about 2 years because of skimpy salads and skimpy entrees for the price we were paying. Today the waitress was on the ball from the drinks to the check. She came back and refilled the salad on the table with a generous portion for all of us. My meal was served hot and delicious. I personally got the Scampi Fettuccine Alfredo. The others that I had joined for dinner also said their entrees were delicious. Casey B also brought us more bread sticks upon asking. When dinner was over she was gracious enough to ask us if she could pack our leftovers for us.  I was grateful that she asked if she could help. Of course we all packed our own once she gave us the to go dishes.  Casey also was very kind to bring us all our own separate checks upon asking.

All waiters and waitresses could take lessons from Casey B at the Olive Garden. She was an exceptional waitress for us this evening. If you go there be sure to ask to sit in her Section you won't be disappointed.
Good job Casey B.
Thanks for recommending the Castello Poggio Moscato. Is was a refreshing sweet slightly peach flavored, a lightly sparkling Moscato.
No room for deserts but the next table over had something with apple, hot caramel and whipped cream and a piece of white cake of some kind that looked mouth watering delicious.
Hope your experience suits your desires. Enjoy. ♡",4

"Store was very crowded, but only 15 minute wait. Our order was promptly taken and quickly made. They appeared to be well staffed, which is not common these days. Very generous portions too, feeling full, feeling good, just like we should. Check out the pic of the mac and cheese, damn good!  Thank you for the great service Heather V.  Mmmm,mmmmm, mmmmmmmmhhhhhh!!!",5
Waited an hour to be seated only to be told we got dropped off the wait list never received confirmation. Promised a courtesy discount and when we asked for it we didn’t get anything. We requested the discount and we’re refused. Asked to speak to the manager but got a different manager who said they couldn’t help us any further. Arrived at 1:20 left by 3:36. Food was good.,3
"Great experience.. my waiter was very good. Even though he didn't eat pork, he suggested that I  have the bacon casserole (next time hold the 'matoes 🍅) it was good.. the 🍊 juice was good with just the right amount of pulp and bits..  Good old country spot..",5
Great country breakfast and the prices are surprisingly low! A must have if you like a hearty breakfast to start your day!,5
Really good as always. Never had an issue with this chain & they are van life friendly.,5
"Good food, really decent service most of the time. My family and I enjoy the Saturday special of the country fried pork chops and fried apples for the side. Not a fan of their strawberry lemonade icebox cake, but their coca cola cake is always super delicious and a classic for a reason. A little taste of home in the hot dry desert, definitely worth the drive.",4
"We were seated in a table that was located in the main walking path that is in front of the entrance to the kitchen where there would be a lot of foot traffic, so we asked to be moved.  We were told that we had to sit there, because the server for that area was suppose to get the next customer.  Because we wanted to be moved, our server Taylor,  was acting very sketchy.  She was nice to our face, but would go to the server area where they put in the orders and watch us out of the corner of her eyes while talking to the other employees and laughing.  The behavior of the staff made us feel like they may have done something to our food, because one by one the employees would come out from the back and look over at our table.  Frankly, they should be more concerned about making the customer happy, not trying to equally divide the customers between the servers!",1
I've been here a few times and I've never had an issue. The food has always been on point like usual and the service has been great. Stopped in for dinner tonight and I definitely enjoyed my visit. The server was great and definitely deserved every bit of that tip. THANK YOU CRACKER BARREL!!!!,5
I had the meat loaf which is really tasty along with a few good sides.....mac n cheese and carrots.  My wife had the 2 piece chicken dinner and it was a winner for sure.,5
"If you have never completed a trip to Cracker Barrel, then you need to start planning one. A few things; come hungry! These portions are not dainty. Also, you can never go wrong with their breakfast menu! Get the apples! Genuine home cooking taste and atmosphere to match. For you non-proper folk...the gravy is sometimes heavy on the pepper. Just a heads up. This particular location did an.amazing job getting to everyone and making them all sorts.of satisfied with their meals! Enjoy the rocking chairs outside while you wait. Also there is a small general shop inside. Old timey candy and drinks! I had a fantastic meal and visit! Thank you.",5
"I have been to this Cracker Barrel on 3 different occasions. The first time I thought maybe it was a fluke, the second time I Chocked it up to maybe they were busy. Third time I quickly realized that it's just plain poor service.

We waited on a table, no biggie. After being seated it's always taken at least 20 to 30 minutes to even place an order. Then we wait and wait and wait. People who arrive 15 to 20 minutes after us get food but not us.

They obviously don't have their stuff together and I cannot recommend eating here. If you do want to eat here give yourself at least 2 hours to do it.",1
"Great food, nice staff and you can't go wrong looking through the shop either waiting to be seated or afterwards. I would recommend getting the app and getting on the wait list before you leave your house.",5
"Quick service, didn't like the table I was given, asked for another person had to ask if it was ok to change (thought that strange), then I think it was because it wasn't wiped off properly, soon taken care of. Other than that service was great and quick. Good food. Had the loaded hash rows, bacon, diet coke and coffee with cream. Don't judge! Lol. Enjoy.",4
"We went on fish Friday, and the meal was awesome! Our server was very attentive and it wasn't too crowded at 3:00 p.m., it started to get crowded around 4:30 to 5:00 as did Texas Roadhouse",5
"Very clean! But the service was terrible, food was inedible... my husband ordered a well-done hamburger,  parts of the patty were bright pink no where near well-done.",3
"My family and I just went to your restaurant tonight for dinner because normally we really enjoy your food. Tonight was not the case. I ordered chicken n dumplings and it was very bland. My son ordered French toast with sausage and the sausage was completely over cooked and literally tasted like beef jerky. The French toast.. I’m not even sure what or how that was cooked but it wasn’t edible. My dad ordered fried chicken and it was so over cooked and dry. My step mom ordered breakfast and hers was mediocre at best. We told the waitress about the food, she didn’t seem real concerned however she did swap my sons French toast at the last minute (as we were leaving) and gave my son pancakes to go… so he left hungry.. I told the cashier as I was paying and she said “well you should have told the waitress”… when I said I did… she said “okay… well we will see you next time”… literally ZERO concern. When I said “No, I don’t think we will be back”.. she said “okay, have a nice day”. 😳 then proceeded doing whatever it is she was doing. Rubs me the wrong way to pay over $60 for food that wasn’t good at all and then to have their employees care less. Definitely will never be back.",1
Good God!!!! Sunday morning breakfast at cracked barrel  was delicious!!!! Friendly stuff great 👍 atmosphere it's awesome love this place for breakfast 😀,5
As always. Good food and a bright and cheerful server.  Cracker Barrel is a safe bet for a tasty meal,5
"My first time at a Cracker Barrel. Delicious food for great prices, and the servers are attentive. I got the Grilled Sirloin Steak with green beans and fruit as sides. The steak was cooked medium-rare perfectly. There's even a neat gift shop, great for holiday shopping, like stocking stuffers for Christmas.",5
Rebecca was great! Food was good but service was above and beyond. A+,5
Food was very good. Came hot and as ordered! But the service was Excellent!! Go! Enjoy!,4
The positive attitudes of the servers and waitstaff made it feel like we were regulars when we had never been here. Homey and welcoming!,5
"My son couldn't eat his eggs, the eggs half a ton of egg shell in it.  And my pancakes cold.  And they didn't seem to concern about it, they kinda laughed and offered us eggs to go.",1
Food was cold. It was bland. Made us all feel nauseous. A very over hyped place do not recommend.,1
"I love Cracker Barrel and the staff at this location. They always seat you right away, and if not, you can browse around and comfortably wait. The weekends get busy since many families go out and eat together but you can also check into the wait list before arriving and they do honor your spot.

The food is always fresh and tasty. Some of the best pancakes in Las Vegas. Classic, comforting country food. Sometimes there is a small wait for your food but they do get very busy and it’s just another indication that your food is being prepared fresh. Waiters and waitresses are always prompt and helpful. Even the manager will come out and check on everyone. I’ve seen him handle some upset customers before in a very professional and understanding manner.

Very rarely are they out of stock on food items. Their holiday foods are also great. Good pricing in their store where you can find various items such as home decor, beauty items, and even seasonal trinkets like Christmas ornaments. If you haven’t visited yet, what are you waiting for?!",5
"I would give them a zero if I could.  Scheduled dinner 2 DAYS IN ADVANCE on Postmates for almost $200 worth of food to be delivered between 515 and 545 on 2/2. The food was from me to a grieving family who lost a son quite unexpectedly just before Christmas and were thankful to not have to pull together dinner on this night. I was shocked and completely embarrassed when the family texted at 615 that nothing had arrived.  When finally getting some info from postmates, I discovered the order was canceled on 2/2 at 521. 6 minutes after it was supposed to have arrived. THEY HAD 2 DAYS TO TELL ME THEY COULDN'T FULFILL THE ORDER. All of this and not a single text, email, heads up, NOTHING!!!! Postmates and Cracker Barrel dropped the ball on this and apparently,  no recourse at all.",1
The barbecue burger was pretty good however they didn't offer the meat anything other than medium well to well done. The staff is very friendly however management might want to hire more weight stuff as it took 20 minutes for us to order a drinks and then another 10 to actually get them. Would go back maybe it was just a fluke.,4
The cook wasn't good. Food came out cold and the pancakes was hard. The server was great very nice and attentive. The host was nice also,2
I haven't been to Cracker Barrel in a very long time but I enjoyed the service and the food thank you very much,5
"My family and I have been here 2 or 3 times now over the last 3 years. I don't know why come back. I really resent bring forced to enter through the stinky gift shop. It's like getting sprayed by those perfume idiots at Macy's. This last time they had all their Christmas candles out and it's like an arms race for each candle to out-smell the other ones. I felt dizzy by the time we got to our booth.
The manager kept coming by or table to make sure everything was good but she was an abrasive person that did not make me feel angry more comfortable. Kinda put me off every time she came by. Here's a pro tip to managers: we don't need to see your soulless face unless we have a problem. Stay away. Please.
I got an accidental cheeseburger (long story) that was pretty good but not worth all the trouble of coming here again.",2
Love Cracker Barrel!  Both their food and the shopping!  Today the hibby and I tried their seasonal special the chicken fried turkey.  It was wonderful!  I especially enjoyed the cranberry orange butter!   The poultry seasoned pan sauce was great too!,5
"Service was great. Food was very substandard. I had the Southern Fried Chicken and it was so overdone that I couldn't even eat it it was like eating jerky , the sides were good as usual except for the biscuits which were about a half inch tall and hard as rocks.",3
"We went for breakfast and were not impressed with our food,  but the service was great.",2
I was so happy to find out that you all had a case of : Ale81's & Gabriel is the one who assisted me over the phone & held them for me to pick up the next day. Which I did . & A young women even put it in Mom's truck. I wish I remember her name . She was working in the store area as well as bussing tables in the dining room area.😊 Everyone in the store area & our waitress was very nice & professional 👌 👍 👏 😀..,5
"Great service, great food, good price, enjoy",4
"Good tasty food, affordable price, ample portion size.

They had a special drink - Peach tea - I feel my words won't do justice to how delicious the drink was. And hey they offer unlimited refills - that's fantastic!",4
It’s been a very long time since I’ve been to a Cracker Barrel. The last time was in Arizona and Texas. I’ve never had a bad experience and the food is awesome 👏 and the service is outstanding with their friendly staff..,5
"I like this place, it's always clean.  The service is great!  I would have given the restaurant a five star but I don't care for their chicken.",4
"Fast, friendly service. Charlie Bravo (our in house name for Cracker Barrel because my step daughter lights up when she hears Cracker Barrel)is our favorite home style cookin place to eat out",5
Took my Aunt for a Black Friday Surprise lunch. She loved it,5
"Waited over a hour left . Said 30 minutes.
People going crazy being rude .
Gift store was nice.",2
My Aunt brought me here on a road trip and I found my go to pot pie. I brought my sister and be partner here and needless to say it will become a staple for us. I love good food. Cracker barrel has some gooooood food! I mean if it was one of your options run with it. You have good taste. Promise you won't be disappointed food wise. This trip I has some maple bacon chicken with turnip greens and sweet carrots. Fire!!! Fire!!! My sister has the fried country chicken dish. I stole of picture of my brother inlaw food before he inhaled it. We had some real good eats. B. In-law ordered the limited buttermilk pie as a must try... We got one to split we was so full. My sister and I almost ate it up from him before he tasted it. Magic in your mouth.,5
"This was my second time eating here, and I was highly disappointed.  I ordered the fried chicken and Greens, and unfortunately the food was cold. We asked for fresh made, hot chicken and were willing to wait. When the food came out again, it was still only lukewarm. The grilled chicken strips were good, but were also warm, not hot. Unfortunately,  this spot has a problem serving hot food.  Also, I would think they could serve vinegar in a little better bottle.",3
"To start it off we arent ones to bash a restaurant however this was one of the worst experiences. The corn bread is really gross, it's free so whatever we let it go. They didn't have loaded tatertots and our server couldn't get our order correctly. I got chicken fried chicken instead of the pork chops, once corrected I should have just had the chicken. The chicken and dumplings were just pepper looked nasty and the taste was how it looked. Once the manager charged off the dumplings she said our sister could have a piece of pie on the house and the only one she was interested in was the cinnamon roll pie and guess what they were out of it. All in all we visited the store, got some strawberry jam and banana moon pies and called it a night.",2
"Came here on a lunch break so I needed quick service. Service was quick very quick. Very nice size portions. Food was good, not there best I've ever had but I'd go back. Couldn't beat the price. Staff was pretty good, water never ran dry. Huge portions for the price. All in all I think we were say, ordered, served, ate and paid in about 45 minutes. Perfect timing for my job.",4
"This place was great! I think many of us have fun nostalgic memories of cracker barrel when we were kids and our parents or grandparents took us to the place now we get to take our kids and grandkids and it's a really neat thing with surprised me or rather impress me the most, was the food quantity to value ratio it was incredible! Don't get me wrong, the food was really good, but the portions were unexpected in the price was very reasonable. Three of us had breakfast plates that also came with biscuit and gravity on the side plus grits on the side and your beverage and it was about $10 a plate for three of us we only spent $30 at this restaurant that's incredible in today's market! The service was wonderful the atmosphere was cheery it was a good visit",4
Great place. Great food! Nice atmosphere and very pleasant.,4
"I was so happy to see a Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas so I knew I had to stop to try it. Parking was super easy here and for me there was. I wait in getting seated.

The menu is exactly the same so I ordered the catfish grilled and blackened, my 3 sides included okra, collard greens and a salad all were pretty good. The greens were eh ok, if I was being honest. The biscuits were fine and I'd have to say it was nice to have that home cooked feeling in Nevada.",4
Deserves more of a 3.5. Food was okay for the most part. Ordered biscuits and gravy. Got enough gravel for 1 of the 3 biscuits. The sausage tasted like wet beef Jersey. It was dry and flat. Country fried steak was good. Eggs good but didn’t get my toast. Hash browns were mediocre.,3
Food was nasty.  I got a piece of sausage that looked like it should be made into a shoe.  Nothing went right at our visit.  The waitress was nice but forgot to bring out several items for us.  The manager ended up waiting on us more than the waitress.  My mom is a diabetic and asked for sugar free items all which we had to ask several times for.  We wont be back except to brouse the store,1
"A+++ This is my first time eating here and I was super impressed with the service and food! Loved their country store! I bought a shirt and earrings! Not planned 😂🤣😂
I stayed over night in my RV in the back parking lot. Somehow I dropped my credit card in the parking lot. A good samaritan turned it in. I didn't realize I had lost it until I was in St George UT! I called and talked with the store manager, Chase Thompson, and he was A-Mazing! He put my mind at ease and was beyond helpful! I will tell everyone about what a great experience I had there! Well run, excellent customer service and great management!",5
"Yum yum yum. Love this place. It’s southern home style food at its best. Food  is great, service is great, prices are great. They have this cute little store full of nostalgic items and candy! Candy that I haven’t been able to find since I was a child. Definitely recommend if you’re in the mood for some authentic southern food.",5
"Just moved to Vegas from Midwest and wanted a taste of home.. Good lord this place was terrible.  A frozen dinner version of Cracker Barrel is the best way to describe it.. dry chicken, old mash and gravy (how do you mess that up?)  And entertain yourself by asking for fried corn bread... southern people know.  Really embarrassing representation of a Cracker Barrel.",1
"Sarah was our waitress and she was so kind. We told her it was our first time and she went over the menu with us. She was on top of making sure we had drinks and when my mom ordered the southern fried chicken dinner, we were told there might be a wait and we were okay with it. That turned into a lengthy wait and the manager stopped to check on us. The chicken arrived after my son and husband had finished their meals. I chose to wait and eat with my mom. I had meatloaf that was moist and tasty.  Turnip greens, pinto beans, and fried apples were so yummy!!! I'd happily eat a bowl of greens on it's own! All in all, we will gladly be back.",5
"Exceptional customer service the menu is of a Sothern flare so traditional for that part of the US, definitely not the West Coast. The food was good I ordered only a fried egg and hash brown, turns out they don't serve oatmeal for breakfast. Now I'm giving only a 3 star because the music was to loud for any time of the day! I mentioned this at the register since they asked how was my visit? I was not surprised I was the third person to complain about the music being to loud, what surprised me was that they did not lower it even though a third person complained!",3
"I loved the atmosphere in that place! Just like in the movies ;)
Plus the shop with all those goodies and that ""country"" vibes!

The food is quite heavy (steak for breakfast anyone?), but delicious! I ate my breakfast at around 11 and it kept me going till a late dinner at 10 PM.

Just know that when you want to go there for breakfast during weekend, you will probably end up waiting for an hour for the table, so if you're in a hurry, better go somewhere else.",5
Service could have been better. Our waiter took forever to brings things out that we asked for. Overall the dood was good.,4
I mean it's good to a point I do not recommend staying there for too long as it gets really uncomfortable the food is good and the workers are reliable,5
"Had Thanksgiving dinner Cracker barrel and it was a disgrace food was cold no taste to turkey cornbread dressing, and the sweet potatoes casserole was not sweet at all taste like it came out the can. The server/ waiter did not Offer water, I had to ask him about if meal came with dinner rolls. I had dinner here before it has never been this Horrible.",1
"Normally Cracker Barrel is one of my favorite places to eat. This evening was a disappointment. The staff was good...the food was served cold as if it was not freshly cooked. Even the coca cola cake at the end was cold...normally warmed, fresh, and causes the ice cream to melt...not so this evening.",3
First and last time I will ever go to a Cracker Barrel. The service was wonderful but I have had better food in the hospital.,1
"Not a place I would go back to, the food was cold & the fresh squeeze orange juice was nothing, but pulp colored water.",1
Food was amazing service was better the convenience of not having to wait when places down the road were over an hour wait conveniently located off the freeway off of Craig I would advise if you wanna have a family night out in the very calm and relaxing sitting I would come here,5
"Great timing, good prices, and great place to take the family.",5
"Great service from host Steven, server Ashley and retail associate Ron. We have eaten at many Cracker Barrel in the east coast but had not been in Las Vegas before. This is convenient to I-15. Breakfast was great and all correct. I shopped in retail area for local stuff. Found a shirt. Also picked-up snacks for our flight back home. I like the light colors on the walls. All the Cracker Barrel’s in Tn, SC and Nc are dark woods. Nice collection of local antiques.",5
I had the Turkey Dinner. Pretty tasty. Service was a tad slow.,4
The food was great! Loved the country store. Lots of cool novelties.  Looking for those stocking stuffers? Go to cracker barrel.,5
Absolute terrible location. Twice now have come here at around 6pm for dinner and ordered there daily special only to be told they were already sold out of there daily dinner special at the start of dinner time. How is it a dinner special if you're sold out of it before dinner even gets going? And the funny thing is as my picture of there dinning room shows they were dead not busy at all hmmm????,1
"Overall this place is really good to look at.  The walk in is amazing,  so many things to see.  The waitress was really nice.  She let us change tables to the one that we wanted. She also took back my steak when it was over cooked and got me a new one.  Not extremly expensive.",4
Our waitress gave us a free piece of pie of our choice to celebrate a birthday! She was so awesome,5
"I've enjoyed this place, since I lived in Nashville, TN. They have the best food remind me of when I was growing up. The service was great! The waiter, wish I could remember his name was great. I will be coming back!",5
I reccomend dinner or lunch here.  The breakfast wasn't as good as some breakfast focused chains I'm used to.  But the staff here are friendly and very helpful!,4
"It's just as you would expect at a Cracker Barrel.  We arrived before they were technically open, but the staff allowed us to wander around the store before being seated. (Smart, because I ended up finding salt and pepper shakers that I didn't need and bought anyway!)  Once seated, service was quick.  Food was fresh.  I also ordered a to-go meal and that came out quickly at the end.",5
Ordered peg game and when I called about not receiving it manager said not his problem. Call the delivery people. Will never go back or order from here again. I know this may seem trivial but that was my money. My money apparently paid for your paycheck in some form.,1
"The chicken pot pie is life! I can make one from scratch, but I sopped the chicken with a biscuit afterward! YES Yes AND Yes! Charli is a great waitress too. We'll be back!!",5
"Well, I will NEVER eat there again.  We went on Thanksgiving day and what a mess the pre-made food was not eatable   Thanks .  What is wrong with Your Corporate office?   The food was pre made and COLD everything tasted like from a Jar or made with out a good cook...OMG we could not get anything else but what you had.  i WILL NRVER RETURN TO THIS  CRACKER BARREL EVER!  You are a mess of a restaurant if there was any   Thanks for Nothing!",1
Pretty good food. Very good portions and good price. Service was very attentive.,5
Good food but orders were not perfect.  Waitress had to go back several times to get one order correct.,4
"Always good and relaxing. Enjoy the gift shop and a game of checkers on the porch.
Ya'all come back now .. ya hear!",5
It is always such a pleasure to visit Cracker Barrel!  The food is excellent and it's  especially fun to take guests to eat there who have never been there before as I did last weekend and they really raved about our dinners!,5
"Very attentive friendly staff here. Pulled off freeway on our way to mesquite and very pleased we did. Cracker Barrels are nice quaint places to eat with attractive gift shops and big warm fire places all done log cabin style and super old memorabilia hanging on the walls and games on the tables to keep you occupied while you wait . Some great daily specials. Had the Saturday special, southern fried chicken came with four prices and two sides mac and cheese was to die for. I think you get unlimited hot biscuits on every table, that's scone in th UK. Lovely.",5
Their new hash brown casserole Skillet bowl is really amazing!,5
"Ordered I think classic fried chicken it didnt have gravy because their are  2 different fried chicken orders. Half chicken (cut by piece) fried to perfection like ur mama cooked it in a.cast iron skillet i just thought it was bland no flavor at all and my Mom dukes seasons her food. Had the bacon mac and cheese not bad I did add some pepper and salt same for the loaded baked potato. The best part for me? Chicken was the normal size a chicken should be. I don't like a chicken wing, leg, thigh or breast bigger than my whole damn body. So that made me happy but still bland but they fry it quite well!",4
Loved the breakfast 🥞!!,5
"As always, great atmosphere and food.",5
"This was not the same food from Cracker Barrel that I expect. I LOVE Cracker Barrel's breakfast. The mama's pancake breakfast is usually my go-to. However, the pancakes here were terrible. They were dense, not fluffy. The edges are supposed to be crispy from the butter/margarine they use for an anti-sticking agent, but they were not. It was very disappointing... 😞 The eggs, bacon, and OJ were still hood though.",1
"Terrible! If you don't look a certain way don't expect a positive experience.  We waited over 10 min after being sat before asking for a manager to explain why we hadn't been seen when tables all around us were seated after us and already visited by their waiter.  The explanation from staff was met with attitudes, as if we were the problem. This restaurant has a history of mistreatment to certain people.  My bad for going against my word in dining here when knowing this could happen.  Terrible",1
"Stopped for breakfast on the way back to LA.
Clean, welcoming, and convenient!
Great service and good corporate food at reasonable prices,",5
"Menu has been greatly reduced.
All meat was overcooked.  The wait to be seated at Cracker Barrel is expected, BUT waiting 45 mins for eggs to be prepared is ridiculous!
Was always one of my favorite restaurants, but no longer.  Extremely
disappointing.",2
Excellent food as always.. Perfect service. Even the syrup bottles were warm which is a big plus..  Now if they could find a way to get that syrup piping hot and teach it to the rest of the Cracker Barrel that'd be great. 😂😂,5
Good food and service. Friendly family environment.,5
"Loved the ambiance! I had grits, catfish, fried apples, corn bread, a biscuit & sweet potatoes so good",5
It's not my cup of tea but I did enjoy it. I have to say that the fried fish was so delicious. The fried apples are always the best and the broccoli sould have been as big of a serving as the potatoes or the fried apples. I still enjoyed it.,5
"This is a great home style restaurant with great service.  I came here today and enjoyed a late lunch.  There was a bit of a wait which was to be expected with the popularity.

They have a great menu, nice ambiance and I like the attached gift shop. The chicken with green beans was great.",5
"Will not be returning to this location, ever.

No booths, very few padded seats. Wide open dining room, which makes it excruciatingly loud with no hope of carrying on a conversation during meals.

Too many huge bright windows, with painful reflections from traffic during the day. Staff dont want to shut shades all the way to the bottom when asked, and the glare is coming from the bottom, where the traffic is.

Horrible waiter. Up our backside while we were reading menu, trying to rush our decision. Then when we finally decided, he brought EVERYTHING at once, after a huge long wait. Didn't bring our first course first, didnt leave time to eat first course. Kept rushing me to finish my salad (after I had him return my entree so I could eat my salad). It was a horrible experience.

Then when I finally finished my salad, he brought out my same food, which was horribly dried out from sitting under a heat lamp for thietty minutes instead of bringing me fresh food, since it was his screw up in the first place. He lied and said they had turkey gravy, then gave me chicken gravy to eat on my bland, flavorless dry mashed potatoes with dry, salty ham (I ordered the sweet ham). Might not have gotten thr wrong food if the waiter had bothered to use the electronic ordering pad, but he chose to try to memorize our order and got my food all wrong.

He was slower that molasses. We only got one refill on our drinks, the whole hour and a half. We had to BEG for those. He never brought us bread. The mgr came around and we asked for bread. It finally areived ten minutes later, cold and dry with cold butter that didnt melt.

There is no reason to return here. The portions were tiny, the price for the meal was exhorbitant. The food wasnt seasoned well and they brought me the wrong meat, knowing I wanted the other.

Id rather go up the road to Tx Roadhouse, where the waitstaff rocks, nobody drops my food on the table with a loud clank and a scowl, nobody rushes me through my meal, my salad is brought out first, the food is seasoned well and never had to be sent back, and the prices are fair, especially considering the portion size. Oh and the bread comes fast, hot and delicious, and never have to ask for refills, which come regularly.",1
"The cook made great fried chicken, but my okra was soggy and a bummer. My daughter though,  swears that Cracker Barrel has the best broccoli!",4
"Hospitable and friendly, great price on the food. The strawberry mimosa knocked me out, imagine a morning tipsiness at breakfast, never had that before but it was good. Sorry I forgot to take pics, but it was my first time and it was worth it.",5
Chicken was over cooked on both entree. Breakfast items were good withnthe exception of under cooked bacon. Love the strawberry mimosa!,5
"Excellent foid and portions and wait staff
Hooked cant wait ro go back",5
The food is always absolutely delicious here! Definitely one of my favorite places to eat now!!,5
Our first time at a Cracker Barrel and it didn’t disappoint. We loved the atmosphere and their hospitality. Our breakfast was delicious and our waitress Sarah from Fresno (now Las Vegas ) was the friendliest and sweetest. We will definitely try to visit other Cracker Barrels if they are ever in our way.,5
"I love this place! Cracker barrel was always a road trip must for my family, now we have one right here at home! The food is amazing with large portion sizes, breakfast available all day, even during lunch and dinner! Not to mention the awesome selection of old school toys that are a happy glimpse of nostalgia, and adorable souvenirs and southern knick knacks for everyone! Ya can even get yourself the table game after food, they have em for sale by the register!",5
"Thank you MS. Diane Barbie, service was great! Food was awesome, after you helped correct the order! Great hospitality!",4
"4 stars just because the wait was super long we got here at 10 and leaving at 1PM. Food was good, it just takes so long to come out 😫. Service was great by stacey, very kind and excellent customer service. I think she could do better with some of her  coworkers even if it's a busy day, I just dont think it's necessary to let customers know they r not working well together 😰 but if you come, ask for stacey she's really nice and very helpful! 😊 bathrooms were clean and love their stores 🥰😍",4
"Their food is the best.  I have been there several times and they have a good selection of menu items.  The only problem I have with this place is deciding what to order.  I rarely order chicken in a restaurant, but I do at the Cracker Barrel.  Not only is it delicious, but the portions are humongous.   Even their biscuits are great.  Another thing I love about this place is the store.  They have a great selection of candies and jellies.  I was ecstatic when I saw that they sell apple butter.  I haven't eaten that since I was a young boy and I missed the taste of putting that on biscuits.  I actually bought a couple of jars.  This place has been open for over three years in Las Vegas and it is still a great place to eat.  The food is consistently good.  I will continue going there in the future.",5
"This Cracker Barrel location SAVED THE DAY! I work at a school where we had an event that nobody ordered brunch for. I had 80+ kids in need of breakfast. I called so many places that were unable to accommodate 80+ people for a to-go breakfast order within 2 hours of ordering. However, Chase, the manager, and his kitchen staff didn't even hesitate to take on the challenge. Not only did they prepare breakfast for 80 kids on a 2 hour short notice, they also created DELICIOUS food, packaged it up so nicely, included utensils, plates, syrup, and a bottle of hot sauce. They literally saved the day with extremely affordable prices. God bless this location!",5
"Love this location. They are fast, friendly and convenient.",5
Food was so good and the place was so amazing and staff was awesome,5
Very good dinner. Waitress was very friendly. Was sat rigjt away with party of 6. Waitress was really nice. Food was really good. Can not beat the prices.,5
"Exceeded my expectations, Cozy and comfortable family place, friendly atmosphere, food and drinks exactly what I was hoping for.. My first time there but Not my last...",5
"We had a great time with our friends from Saint Louis. The perfect place to come and enjoy good food, talk and laugh.",5
"It was so crowded! Rather long wait but it's ok.   Save some time. Go to the cracker barrel website for the craig road restaurant,  check out the approximate wait time. Register for the wait list . Check in once at the restaurant.  It will save time in line.The food was really good. We had the catfish. Roast beef,  ham, chicken and dumplings. We also had the coca cola cake. All were really good. The cake was moist and a perfect chocolate flavor. It comes with ice cream. Las Vegas  should have had a cracker barrel here a long time ago. We will definitely eat here again. Nicest servers I've met in a long time. It was my family's first time there and they loved it.",5
I love that place! The server was so nice she take care of us really good!,5
"I really loved this place! Staff was okay. The gift shop has sooo many things to look at!! It's so pretty. Has a ton of candy & they have special Root Beers, cream sodas, etc. They have seasonal things. Right now they have a bunch of stuff up for Christmas & Fall. The food is also very decent. Overall a great place to go with my family!",5
"Cracker Barrel used to be delicious but the quality has gone way down.  I had the chicken and dumplings and it was awful. Bland and overcooked.  Definitely not homemade, most likely frozen and reheated. Disappointing. Skip this place. There are plenty of other great places to eat in Vegas.",1
"I have always loved Cracker Barrel! This location continues the tradition. The building is pretty much what you would expect from any other location. The staff are very down home friendly and available if you need them. We changed our minds on something and had no trouble getting attention in less than a couple minutes. The food was also just like I remembered from past experiences and delicious! I admit I only eat breakfast here so if that is what you are looking for, trust me, you can’t go wrong!!!",5
The service was great but the food sucked the eggs were watery and fell apart just as my Fork them,1
"Good food, adequate service. Cracker Barrel has consistent food across their chains. As for service, it’s the luck of the draw. I’ll give our guy the benefit of the doubt and believe he was tired on a busy lunch duty.",4
"I had food delivered to my hotel since I didn’t have my car available at the time.  I ordered the Fresh Start Sampler which was supposed to come with fresh seasonal fruit and granola.  It did not come with ANY granola, and the fruit?  A big uncut, stem-on strawberry plopped in the middle of the yogurt!  No spoon included to eat it with either.  The blueberry muffin tasted old and the top of it was hard.  The eggs were lukewarm (understandable because eggs cool off so quickly) and the coffee and lemonade were placed in a wobbly tray so that the poor delivery driver got it spilled on her shirt!  Since Postmates did the delivery, the manager I spoke with couldn’t do ANYTHING for me.  Worst $50 I ever spent on a lunch!",1
Out of all of the cracker barbells we've gone too this has the best service by far. Great people working there.,5
Food was good but our service was great! Quickly seated and our server was very attentive and friendly.,5
Great good with awesome service plus a shop inside food clothes ornaments ect,5
Very helpful friendly staff all around.  There was a small wait but looked around the store.,5
Omg.!!! The best pancakes. I loved it. Thank you. Alexa!,5
"The visit took 2 hours start to finish. It was busy. If you're allergic to eggs and need breakfast this might not be the best stop for you as the only thing that didn't have egg in it was the biscuit and gravy. The sausage was overcooked the gravy had zero flavor almost like they forgot to put the salt in it. The ham steak I got however was pretty good though a few of the bites tasted like it might have been close to the end of its safe-to-consume window. The rest of the food was just ""meh."" Won't visit again.",3
I was hesitant to go because of the bad press they got. We went and found the place so cute and friendly. I'm going to have to go shopping for the holidays.,5
This visit was definitely not up the usual Cracker Barrel standards. We had to wait 10 minutes to be seated despite a nearly empty restaurant. The biscuits were definitely not hot or fluffy. The service was okay but overall this visit was a disappointment.,2
Good comfort food in a relaxed atmosphere! Excellent service and convenient location. Recommended.,5
Awesome experience first time here me and my Godmother.. The Food is great come just it out y'all...,5
"Service from Gregg was great, he was a wonderful server. The rest is no reflection on him as a waiter. We went specifically for the chicken and rice that they serve on Saturdays and were very disappointed. The plate had to be sent back two times because the rice was burnt. The first time the manager brought it back told us she had made sure they pulled out of a new pot of rice but it was still burnt. The third try there was no burnt rice. And surprisingly the manager still charged us for the plate. The rest of the table had finished eating before one person had a plate they could eat.",2
Good food and I love the old school sodas candies and novelties in their country store...they have J.R. Watkins ligament and pain relief spray...small cookware...greeting cards...candles....preserves...clothing... jewelry etc...,4
"Awesome country food and a warm, friendly atmosphere",5
I had my Grand& Gr8grandkids they were very helpful & the service was GR8.,5
Wonder greetings and breakfast is always AMAZING 😋🍳🥓☕🙂,5
"Bad tough steak. Burnt chicken strips.
Bad service 😔 had 3 girls and had to ask several times to get drinks or sides.",2
Everything was delicious!! Only thing was we wished the bacon was crispier other than that we loved our first Cracker Barrel experience!,4
Very delicious breakfast at very reasonable price. I strongly recommend it,5
Very kind waitress who was very attentive. The prices were very reasonable. Great place to eat when craving a home cooked meal!,5
Great service and love cracker barrel store. The only food item didn't like was cornbread its not sweet as I like it and has aftertaste. I had chicken pot pie this time.,5
"By far the cutest restaurant - store ever! I ordered the chicken tenderloin country platter and it was actually pretty good. Their peach tea is on a whole different level though, incredibly delicious. Overall the service was prompt and staff very kind.",4
"Best place for breakfast lunch and dinner
Old fashioned
I feel home eating my grandma recipes
You have to check this place",5
Loved the biscuit begnets with my hot mocha!,5
First time in CB and me and my family loved it. From interior and atmosphere to customer service.  Sarah is how all workers in restaurants should be. Take a time and interest in her customer.  Definitely coming back whenever passing through LV,5
Good food friendly service would for sure come back :),5
"It was a busy pippin place today, but still got a table fairly soon. Server was brand-new, Kathy. She was fabulous! Food is ALWAYS GREAT at Cracker Barrel!",5
"We've eaten at Cracker Barrel here and in Utah a handful of times, usually when other people choose it. We've had some good dishes and some meh. The store is cute, though.",3
No complaints here. They were pretty busy but we didn't have to wait very long at all.,5
"Its Cracker Barrel,  so you know what your getting.  Was able to get right in as it wasn't that busy on the day we went.  Our wait person was very nice.",4
"Fast paced, friendly staff, great food. A little too packed for my liking.",4
"Love the southern homestyle feel of The Cracker Barrel. Great service, server was always there to ensure my coffee was full and cream and sugar were handy.",4
"Amazing fried chicken! A must try if you visit, the service was great as always!",4
"Love this place, the food is amazing especially the casserole tater tots. Yum, but I also love the candy selection they have with a little bit of everything in the gift shop.",5
"Service slow. Seemed like it took a long time just to bring our water and coffee.  Food was very good though. Husband's order wasn't right..he wanted cornbread instead of biscuits.  I asked our waiter for a 2nd cup of coffee. He said it'll be just a minute. He walked by me 5 times waiting on other tables but still didn't bring my coffee!  This is a BIG no-no for me. Dining area very noisy. If they're going to have the wooden chairs on tile, PLEASE PUT FELT OR RUBBER SOCKS ON THE CHAIRS!!  Hard to hold a conversation or hear the waiter.",2
Always great hardy home cooking never had a bad experience oh and the apple butter is out of this planet good,5
This location has perfect service and is so clean! Great experience!,5
Wonderful place . Gift shop very nice prices are reasonable. Food delicious!!,4
"Great place for breakfast. Next time you have pancakes there, try putting the grits on top of the pancakes and then the syrup. You will be pleasantly surprised",5
"Good food, meat loaf and Mac n cheese was awesome, good price (normal), staff were so nice it was like southern charm, manager even walked by to ask how things were. 100% score",5
"It's a smaller in size than it's other Vegas location. It is clean, the service was fast. Our server Patrick was a hoot, his eyes were red and glossy like Brad's wife. His fried chicken recommendation went over well, the chicken was excellent!! My wife had the lemon pepper trout with fried okra, it was so taste and light.
I will definitely be back here for a meal.",4
Great  service & very good food. The menu was very easy to understand.,4
Not too crowded. We were seated quickly. Food came out hot. Didn't have to scream over a full dining room,4
Fast and friendly service. Can't go wrong with the breakfast day or night.,5
"My favorite restaurant! Best food, best service ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
Really good food. Little game on tables to play while you're waiting. Really brings back the country feeling.,5
"First time food was cold, out of all the fish dishes and meat. Not a good experience. Green beans out of a can, mushy.",1
The food the service were outstanding... The place was nice clean...Will  be back..,5
All of the staff was extremely friendly the food was delicious the proportions were awesome for the price and of course how could you pass up the General Store even if you just grab a candy bar The Nostalgia of the place is out of this world,5
"Love Cracker Barrell,  great food, great staff!",5
Food was delicious! Everything in the store was on sale!,5
Second bad dinner there this time it was overcooked fried chicken very dry service was subpar many mistakes,1
Breakfast was amazing at this location and the chef cooked my food just right.,5
"Did a take-out order. Friendly staff, food was hot and ready faster than expected. Have not been to Cracker Barrel in ages and was happy to see all the good old fashioned candy and unique items for sale!",5
It was very busy because it was New Year’s Day. Our server Amy was the very best. Food at Cracker Barrel never disappoints. Wishing we had one much closer to home. Food is always fresh and so tasty.,5
Good food and jot to expensive. Great store in the front of the restaurant. Service is a little lacking but we did get all of the food we ordered eventually.,5
"Food was fine and fresh. Due to the establishment being understaffed, I would anticipate a slight wait.",4
"Everyone is nice and friendly. The food is great. The kids 2yrs up to 27 yrs all love the food and looking at everything and wishing and wanting something, even me. When we traveled we would look for signs to the Cracker Barrel. Just a great place..reminds me of my grandma.",5
It was really great and they had great service. The only bad thing is they didn't have the checkers and triangle game out. But other than that it was really good.,5
Great lunch for the price of the meals. Our waiter Michael was an outstanding member of this restaurants team. I will visit this location again when we are in the area.,5
Food was great.  Service was amazing. Thanks to Taylor for making it a great experience.  Highly recommend. Store was just as awesome as the restaurant.,5
I had a Great experience. Our waitress Jessica was there every time we needed her. Thanks for a Great experience,5
The service was good and the food was excellent! I enjoyed myself as always!,5
"This place never disappoints, staff is friendly and courteous, food is hot and we never wait long for our dishes, it's clean and the atmosphere is just extra..oh yeah they have real wood burning..",5
Service really slow. Loved the gift shop while waiting. Food was good but really SMALL side dish portions. LOVE THE DECOR INSIDE AND DON'T FORGET THE ROCKERS OUTSIDE,3
Good service and good food. 👍,5
Great place to eat. Always packed which is a good sign of a great restaurant. Staff is friendly. Must go for good food.,5
"We were in Las Vegas and went to the barrel for dinner.
I love their meat loaf and most of their comfort food. Good food at reasonable prices so cannot go wrong.",4
Love their country breakfast.  I especially love their pancakes with warm syrup.  Service was slow but staff was very friendly.,4
The gift shop was a pleasant surprise ☺️ I  enjoyed looking around and buying the fried apples. The food was delicious and customer service was great! I will be coming back to try other menu items.,5
I'm going to give 4 stars mainly because of the food and it's quality the service was OK it was busy so I will give this restaurant a other chance pricing was fair,4
Crowded with busy staff. Food was decent,4
"This location is really good. It is more of a family style type of experience I don't try to rush you out. The store is particularly small but it appears that they try their very best to accommodate your needs. The restaurant itself is clean, have a good experience overall, and the stop is trained well in hospitality",5
"First day of work 😊 I enjoyed it , Thank you",5
"Had really been craving the ""Grandma's Sampler/Breakfast"" for a few weeks & decided to go today... 1st time ever being disappointed here. Pancakes were to bland & had that ""bready"" taste, like cornbread & not cooked throughly. Eggs looked like slime because of egg white & hashbrown casserole  was very dry, mushy & cold.
Waitress was ok...polite but I could feel her energy & sense she was uncomfortable with my presence for whatever reason. I also didn't like that she intentionally did certain things/actions to make it known to me that she was working for her tip😒 NOT however work from her heart with hospitality & compassion",2
We are from South Carolina and always stop at a local Cracker Barrel. We were not disappointed. Steven was the host very effective and helpful. Ashley was our server. She had a lot of tables but was not stressed looking and very nice. Food was correct and hot. Coffee was refilled as needed. I shipped in the retail area and picked up a few items. Candy and shirts. I would recommend this store for anyone in the area.,5
"Normally,  I love Cracker Barrel. This visit was not up to par.  The biscuits and cornbread were stale and hard. Not sure if the waitress was new or not..... we asked for lemon water and we got plain water,  no big deal.  Then we ordered our food and the sides are wrong. It was just a mess.",3
love this place! The food and the cute country store,5
"I haven't been to a Cracker Barrel in years, so we decided to have dinner here.  It was a real treat.  The place is spic n span clean, the store fun and interesting to look around, the food was excellent, service was good, and prices more than fair.  It was an enjoyable experience and I would highly recommend it.  So why not 5 stars?  With all the first-class 5 star restaurants in Las Vegas, I could not bring myself to awarding a 5 to this casual cafe, even though this one was perfect in every way.  It just doesn't compare to a place on the strip that will cost you $500+ for dinner.",4
"If you're very hungry and you only have $20. , I'd better recommend you go to a buffet in some casino, because at Cracker Barrel they sell you separate hash browns, coffee, soda, etc. at breakfast. ( 2 eggs, 1 piece of Canadian ham cut into 2 halves to make it look like 2 meats, hash brown and coffee, total $16.50, for that amount of money you can go to the buffet, have breakfast well and eat dessert and salad",2
The service and the food was great!!! Everyone got full and were satisfied with what they ordered.,5
Great prices and service.  I recommend the loaded hash brown casserole.,5
Great fish fry on Fridays. Great portions for a good price.,5
This place is like an upscales Denny's comfort food galore one of the best eateries I've been to in Las Vegas area reminds me of a Black Bear diner awesome food awesome mashed potatoes awesome chicken if you love comfort food you need to give this place to try I didn't even know existed I driving by at a hundred times but it's delicious,5
"Huge portions of food, fast serving time, wonderful... attentive... kind staff.  Thanks to Alberto for taking good care of us as a server. We'll plan to be back again",5
Always a favorite comfort food spot for me . Love cb .. do wish they were more like the cb I visited on the east coast though.....,5
"Steak was too salty, manager came out and in a condescending manner told us that they use garlic salt and garlic sauce and since we didnt know that we could order it without he would make another. He did....NO SEASONING WHATSOEVER! Hash brown casserole was a bit overdone, dry, and had some scorched parts. Waitress was great, cashier was great. The Cracker Barrel we visited in Nashville a few days ago was fantastic, best steak ever. North Las Vegas needs to talk to the Nashville crew and step their game up!!",2
"My family took us here for lunch. I’d heard really good things about Cracker Barrel, so I had high expectations going in. This place was the biggest disappointment. The best thing was the biscuits.

We waited about 20-30 minutes for a table. Once seated, we waited even longer. The family seated just before us got their food, ate, and left and we had not been served. We had 2 tables. Orders were not taken at the same time nor brought together.

They don’t have much of a selection, or perhaps nothing peaked my interest. The food was awful. There was no seasoning. The steak was not a great choice of meat for the price. I could have paid $3 more and gotten a flavorful steak meal at Applebee’s.

The baked potato was ok.

My coke was watered down.

I took a couple bites and could not finish it. I had asked for half price off the meal. Rather than give me half price for the meal she took money off the already watered down drinks.

Our checks were not separated and I ended up paying for stuff that was not mine.

We left and took my son to get food from Carl’s Jr.

I will not be returning to any Cracker Barrel and would not recommend this place. I’m not much of a fan of this type of restaurant or any buffet, but I will say Home Town Buffet and the Golden Corral are way better and you’ll get your money’s worth.",1
"The food was hot and very good for a to go order. The caller that took my order was helpful and placed it correctly. A great experience. Will be ordering again, if not visiting in person soon.",5
"All these years that Cracker Barrel has been opened I finally got the chance to go there mind You this was for breakfast only! Everything was delicious! Service, Food, Ambiance, & Nostalgia are included in My Rating! If it were up to Me, I would rate it 100! Thank You!",5
"Very busy at lunch time, staff was excellent, food was great and service was great.",5
"Place is awsome so many choices for adults and children. Good at home cooking at a fair price not too cheap but wont break the bank. There decorations make it feel as tho ur in an old contry shop, however they have an old contry shop attached to the restaurant. The selection of the shop varies from retro candy and toys to clothes and indoor/outdoor decorations. U can shop while u eat and they have awsome new ice cold brewed coffees. The service here was on point and did not disappoint. There parking here is free and the lot is large and convenient. Plus afterwards u can enjoy a good game of checkers on there patio outside on there rocking chairs. All in all it's a 1 stop shop for food and other purchases just got to come check out there unique ways of food services.",5
"Atmosphere was nice, food was good as was the service, but the meatloaf portion was very small like it was made in a pie pan instead of a meatloaf pan. Maybe it was just the lunch portion size.",3
"YALL KNOW I LOVE CRACKER BARREL!!!!! family and I went during lunch so it was a lil packed. Luckily we got seated right away. The servers are always professional and greet us right away. When it comes to the food you can always get a lot for a decent price. I ended up get the Grandpa Breakfast with the country fried steak, which was phenomenal. I love the pancakes as well so you know I had to dabble in and add that. The food came in an exceptional time. All in all good meal + good service = happy customer",5
"Good was mediocre at best and over-priced. Tiny portion of over-cooked roast beef, sweet potato smothered in marshmallow. Ugh. Thin, tastless country fried chicken. Server was alone and stressed. Didn't get my coffee til I was leaving. All in all, disappointing.",3
Really good food and service. Enjoy looking through the gift shop.,5
"I liked the pecan pancakes but my wife's French toast was not too hot and her $3 fruit cup was pitiful.  If you are handicap make sure to have a powered wheelchair, it is a long walk into the restaurant, even from the handicapped parking spots.",3
Good food for reasonable prices and hearty plates. We were seated fast and the wait staff was polite and helpful.,4
"Well, usually when I go to a Cracker Barrel, the food is great! Today, not so much... The service, as always is fantastic, but the bacon and sausage I had as well as my guests had, were over microwaved. Yes I said microwaved. Rubbery and stale. The eggs and pancakes were just fine and the biscuits were fresh and delicious, so why can't they use the same cooking methods on the bacon and sausage as the eggs? Or other meat for that matter? I was just sad and disappointed with this visit.",3
The food wasn't up to par this visit. I enjoy breakfast at any hour of the day. The pancakes were rubbery and the grits were scraped from the bottom of n the container. Drinking glasses were suspect. I dunno whats going on but this visit wasn't a good one. Even after notifying the manager nothing was done about the issues with the food.,3
"Amazing Thanksgiving dinner
Service was beyond friendly",5
"Cornbread muffins (taste gritty) and southern fried chicken, both need more seasonings! Long wait time for items to be put on the table. Also, long wait for servers to help you, after food was served!",3
Always love eating at Cracker Barrel! This location wasn't as good as the one near Blue Diamond but it's still good,4
"Politics and respect for workers aside, Cracker Barrel does make reasonably priced meals that can resemble home style. I rarely have complaints when I dine here however on this takeout visit my carrots were way undercooked and hard as rocks. Again this is a rare occurrence and usually all is prepared well.",4
"The food was tasty, but when my wife cut into her country fried steak ahe pulled out, not 1 but 2 hairs! Our server and the manager both acted very nonchalant. The manager then told us she'd put in a complaint, because they were delivered frozen, is that what you want your customers knowing?",2
"My first Cracker Barrel experience and it was underwhelming.   Clean and kind of fun.  Great gift shop.  Food just didn't live up the the hype.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very good either.   Just meh.",3
I love Cracker Barrel.   I try to eat there whenever I see one when I'm traveling since there's none close to our city.,5
First time was a miss but thus time my meal was a hit!! I wouldn't suggest the biscuits and gravy my cousin ordered though. 3 stars because my food was good but they should really make sure your food is hot when serving it.my cousin had to send 2 things back to get reheated.,3
"Great Service from Paulo 🎉👏🤎
The food was excellent 👍, it was my first time there and will not be my last!",5
Great food and service. Definitely recommend this restaurant.,5
Nice food for a home dinner.,5
"Major bummer... I love this place. BUT this last time the food was awful. I was underwhelmed to say the least. Runny eggs, cheese wasn't even melted on a burger, the sausage was cold in the middle.  However; management was quick to react. Ended up okay in the end. Just sad because I used to genuinely look forward to going here.",3
Waited over 85 minutes before we got served our food after ordering it they lost the order  had to remake it made it wrong and had to remake it again it was expensive and it wasn't even tasty or a lot of food I would not recommend going there plus the service sucks they don't care they actually don't care,1
"We stopped in around 1pm to meet friends. It is a Saturday and I knew it would be busy so we first reserved a table online. It wasn't quite ready yet when we arrived, so we just waited outside.

I ordered the Maine Blueberry 2 stack and it was absolutely delicious!!! The tiny little blueberries and the Blueberry syrup pack a huge punch! It was slightly tart and not overly sweet the way I like them. In true southern fashion, I had a sweet tea with my pancakes. My husband had the pecan pancakes 4 stack and fried okra as a side. That fried okra was just pure love! We had a great meal, but the gem of every Cracker Barrel is the old Country store. They have old school candy, Nehi sodas, and if you are from the East Coast Cheerwine. They have cool stuff for the yard, garden, indoor decor, wedding gifts, and just random cool stuff. They also have some daily devotional stuff and faith based merchandise, which is refreshing to see nowadays.",5
"Biscuits were hockey pucks. Server brought me a supposedly fresher one, but it wasn't much better. Bacon was good.",1
"This place will always bring good memories, great food, and a place to enjoy what was. The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the ambiance was nostalgic. Can't wait to go back!",5
"Be prepared to wait, people love this place. I wasn't disappointed,  good old time meals.",5
"Breakfast eggs were old, they were very dry. Server was repeatedly asked to bring more coffee and condiments but forgot.",3
Great food. Cute store with lots of deals.,5
Social distancing in place.... Staff is amazing.... Food delicious... And a little store to shop in before or after you eat,5
Would suggest not getting the pot roast was not very good. Mac and cheese was cold service was not up to par. Overall will not be going back,1
Normally good food and good service. Servixe was not as good today. Perhaps the waiter was having an off day.,3
Worst service ever had in my 50 years of life and I done out min 5 times a week.,1
"Food was wonderful,  seemed like the server was easily distracted.",4
super happy about my Togo order server Emily she was such a huge help !! in a very busy day definitely coming again,5
We went here for a quick breakfast on our roadtrip. Unfortunately it took quite a while until we got our food (over 1 hour). I think they currently have some issues to staff up here,3
I ordered Thanksgiving dinner from this location. I have been a loyal Cracker Barrel fan my whole life. The food was good but they did not give me the Spiral honey ham I had purchased. Instead they gave me breakfast ham shanks.  This was not what I had ordered or paid for.  When I called the manager I was left on hold for 25 minutes and then when I finally called back they did not answer the phone at all.  I was very polite and was just asking them to fix the mistake. Cracker Barrel has lost a customer for life.  I would not recommend doing their holiday meals.,1
"While I generally LOVE Cracker Barrel this particular restaurant's food was mediocre at best. The biscuits tasted like the were made from mud, the special order on the omelet wasn't done correctly. The waitress was friendly enough but you could tell she was overwhelmed by minor inconveniences.",1
"Cracker Barrel is definitely one of my favorite restaurants from Florida and I'm so glad they're not just here in Vegas but I work close to one, as well! I can just walk and eat well for dinner!",5
Food great friendly 😋service helpful will come back thank you so much,5
Good breakfast deals and big portions. Can't go wrong at all.,5
"The most amazing thick and tasty, pancakes I have ever tasted, second to Waffle House I opted for a stack of four pecan ones, and golly they were delicious, I had a beautiful butterscotch latte and it was amazingly creamy and gorgeous.
I also had the pleasure of visiting the on site shop, a mecca for old school cane sugar sodas from yesteryear, and bygone chocolate.
Our server was kind and attentive, and an asset to his organisation.",5
THE BEST 🍗 CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN AND FOOD AT A RESTAURANT I'VE EVER HAD LIKE HOME COOKED MEALS WITHOUT THE DISHES TO DO AFTERWARDS,5
"Unfortunately I gave them one star I rather give them zero Stars now this is only because first time experience going there this is what I experienced the food that came out was old and cold like it said around in the kitchen back there the bread was very dry drier than any desert in the world 🌎
And apart from that the service needs improvement the whole time we were there the waitress or waiter never really came by to refreshing our drinks.
Overall I would say the food was worse than an elementary cafeteria lunch.",1
"Ok. Not like it was when we first fell in love with CB. The selling point was that it was old  fashioned and traditional. Not fond of the store products-rare to find anything faith based, the  ""I couldnt care less about you"" staff or the needless addition of alcoholic drinks, and God forbid if you want a salad as a side. They've all but buried that.
I get more disappointed each time I go. Its getting to be the same as all the other chains resturants. Nothing great...so sad.",2
There was stuff on my cup but the food was good if there wasn't stuff on my cup then it would be a 5 star,3
I started this morning at the cracker barrel on east craig road but left and decided to drive 30 minutes to the other cracker barrel in town as there were only a couple of families there and they were cramming  everyone in a corner this is not about covid its about common sense. I asked if I had to sit there and she huffed a little and said ill see what I can do..it was 7 am and the place was basically empty  I have decided to never go to cracker barrel again as everytime I go its always always something not worth it,1
The best breakfast place,5
The chicken and dumplings were the worse I have tasted. The biscuits were hard and cold. The only thing good was the tea.,2
Very friendly knowledgeable server. Food was OK portion size OK,3
My chicken was so overcooked that you couldn't bite through the crust.  Bad.,1
"Fast service, good food at reasonable prices, I'm never disappointed at Cracker Barrel.",5
"Great decor, awesome customer service, delicious food! Tons of items in the gift store.",5
Great food and service recommended to anyone who would be visiting for the first time or are a veteran of this establishment. Fair prices and large portions will bring you back every time guaranteed.,5
Great food...prices and people,5
The food was fabulous and the service was great.,5
The food and waiter was awesome.   We walked in and gave our name and number and was told it would be 20 min.  After 20 min we checked back in with the manager and she yelled at the guests quit standing around and move about the store and we was was told it would be about another 10 min.   We waited another 20 and after 6 parties that had come in AFTER us was seated she told us we was next. We waited another 10 minutes and then was seated. When she seated us she threw our menus down on the table.  I love cracker barrel but this is unacceptable customer service. The whole atmosphere was not a happy place.,1
Food was good but the eggs could've been better overall was an bad experience the service was good,4
The food and service were excellent and the prices are modest.,5
"Great food, service and price.   Had the country fried steak and eggs.  OMG",4
We went for our daughters birthday dinner and it was a great experience. After dinner our wonderful server brought out a slice of chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream amd her friend asked if it was ok for her to announce it and ask to sing along as the restaurant didn't do it. The entire restaurant joined in and sang happy birthday so this is one for the memories.,5
"Great ""home style"", American food.  Nice,  friendly service. It's a good, relaxing place to eat.",5
Definitely not what it used to be. It couldn't possibly be cook fresh if nothing was hot enough except the fried fish. And it all was pretty lackluster. One mushy dish was just like the last. Sad really.,1
"I signed in online to be there at 11, waited 20 minutes to get in and then 45 minutes to receive food, and got the wrong order, apparently the guy gave our order to other table, so waited another 20 minutes for the right order to come in and honestly was not good, we ended up eating separate and the final plate was served at our table at 1:25pm for 2 eggs half bacon and a burned sausage, absolutely dissapointed, I have been in cracker barrel in other states and the plates are big, the food is fresh, this is definitely not worth the money or a 2 hour wait, we got 50% discount because we didnt get a full experience, but honestly i was hesitant even to pay that... go to Dennys or the buffetts, don't waist your time here.",1
Thanks for the good service and the food was delicious. Next time. I'm going to try the cheesy  hash browns . I took some of husband when he was looking.,5
"Only one small slice of meatloaf, and about 7 steak fries..lots of empty plate!  Meatloaf was falling apart & tasteless, Dumplings were tasteless & watery, Trout was Ok..A ripoff at $41 !",1
"The food is always good, even when they're busy.",4
4 price chicken plate was trash. Every piece looked like it belonged in a hot wing special. Very small portions and what tasted like factory made sides. Biscuit was cardboard.,1
Full of all of the cracker barrel goodness,5
Food and service were really good. Pancakes are delicious and sugar cured ham is on point. Just make sure to put a reservation in online before showing up as it can be a long wait.,5
Good comfort food and service.,5
They messed up 2 of our orders other than that food was good,4
Would go there agian,4
"James was our waiter. He was fantastic. The food and the ambience was great. I'm from Nashville Tennessee, where Cracker Barrel started. The one here does them proud.",5
Food taste dirty.  Like a dirty kitchen,2
Great meal with great service.,5
Great customer service! Would of gave 5 star's but biscuits could break out a window ):,4
Great place to eat. Always good food. Love the little shop and old fashioned stuff.,5
Went to get Catfish they were out! Settled for the shrimp I just should have left.,2
"We are breakfast and it too was social distancing....I hope lunch and dinner is better because if it's not, the way people hype it up, I feel like probably haven't had a good home cooked meal on a long time or very often. 2 plus 2 more thumbs way down. Sorry😬😔🙄",1
"Good food, service was fast.  The have good social distance going in the dining room, but the retail section was pretty crowded.  Really good French toast!",4
The food was great but out waitress was rude and forgot multiple things. Almost too the point where it was becoming questionable as too if she was doing it on purpose or not.,3
Good food. Good service. Friendly staff. It's a must go to for my family,5
Just awful. First time eating a CB. Is this how it's supposed to taste? I can honestly say that my whole family was pissed off. Maybe they just had a bad day in the kitchen... don't know. 8-(,1
Our experience was amazing. Our server was Katarina and she was quite nice and helpful. My father and I each got chicken fried steak with eggs and hashbrowns. It was delicious and quite filling. We ended our meal with chocolate Coca-Cola  cake which was delicious as well. Overall everything was very exquisite and we look forward coming again sometime.,5
Great staff and food❣️ I've spent more time in fast food lines lately that aren't really worth it. Thanks guys and girls great job 🖤👍🏾👍🏾,5
"Called to see how long the wait was lady said “about 40 minutes but if you check in online it will hold your spot and time..” absolutely not true!!! We got here about 20 minutes after reserving online lady says “ok thank you we will call you when it’s ready..” 1 hr and 15 minutes later we ask about it.. lady says “oh when you book online your actual wait time doesn’t start till you check in with us in person..” excuse me, wait, what!!! So needless to say we waited 2 hrs total for a table and to make matters worse it wasn’t even worth it..",2
FOOD AMAZING! AMAZING SERVICE!!!,5
Great comfort food.,4
"This place is great, we really missed going here with this so called pandemic going on. But the wife called and found out how we could get in. The only downside side is towards the end we felt like we were being pushed out the door. Which I can understand they need to make money and only having half the seating makes a little sense. But all in all I will continue to recommend this place for good food and friendly atmosphere.",5
"Good food,  I would get on the waiting list via their website for Saturdays and Sundays for breakfast.  It's gets busy during the weekend",5
Great place to visit they make your meal like coming home with large portions and homemade meals it's a must try....,5
Excellent Southern cooking. Meatloaf is awesome!,5
My husband and I were surprised to learn that they serve wine and mimosas!,5
Good food and fun atmosphere,5
"Biscuits were hard, gravy was dry, waitress was great!",3
"We arrived and were shown to a table. It was apparent the table was dirty. I asked the hostess to seat us at another table, which she did. Without cleaning it, she sat a 3 person party at the dirty table within 5 minutes. Not cool!!! Won't return here.",1
Sad to say this is the 1st time I was disappointed with the food. Our fried chicken was like jerky(dry and tough). Service was quick but not very friendly😞,1
"So had to ask for pepper 5 times. O had to get up and get my OWN..

WAITER BRINGS ME A PLASTIC CUP OF PEPPER..? HUH..?

SERVICE WAS -5. TERRIBLE...FOOD WAS NOT PROPERLY PREPARED OR DONE..

I WAS VERY SAD..NORMALLY CRACKER BARREL HAS A HIGHER STANDARD.

WAS A BADD EXPERIENCE ALL THE WAY AROUND.

Not good day for cracker barrel..",2
"Terrible. Had pot pie no carrots, just chicken dry. Would not recommend",1
"Best southern food menu. I just wish they had a restaurant in Summerlin, we would be there all the rime.",5
Spell garage door looks great the prices were right and the waitress had a nice smile,5
Great steak!. Fried potatoes with cheesy rice blend was fantastic! Build one in L.A. soon,5
"Customer service was good..Food was horrible chicken and dumplings had no flavor, not thick, it was flat dough in water DISGUSTING!! Also southern fried chicken was cold and salty..normally the food is good but this is the 2nd time I should have passed on this restaurant 🙃",2
Well the wait was like 2 hours the food was ok were over charged on 2 different orders but very nice clean nice waitress and polite.,4
Great atmosphere good food great service,5
Always always a great establishment to Patron.,5
The breakfast was outstanding.,5
Excellent Service & Food. I just love the atmosphere at Cracker Barrel.. The gift shop has really unique items.,5
Good old fashion country restaurant!,5
Food was amazing 👏 😋,5
Great food the restaurant down the street was packed and I forgotten to make reservations crackle barrel was open no wait time fast service great customer service.,5
"The main food is so delicious, the sides are a bit lacking. The decor is cute, very Americana nostalgia but it was a bit too much for me.",4
"Good home cooking, at a fair price. Lots of variety. Best pancakes in the game",4
"Every one of these restaurants is very friendly, nostalgic, great food better prices.",5
"Chill place, turnip greens was a good side dish. Waiter said he needed to go to Boulder City to get the water, was worth it. Sampler plate is good if you aren't familiar with ""American"" food.",5
Could not get in too long of a wait,1
"It was very good. Service was excellent. Got our food quickly. Everything was exactly how we ordered it. Will definitely be going back. We got the steak, country fried chicken, cheeseburger, mac n cheese.",5
"I can't believe how nice everyone was here. The food was delicious and affordable, but the service really blew me away.",5
The new design is awful and decorations are less welcoming. Why did my salad and eggs have a different flavor at this place ? Soup was good after I practically used a bottle of salt!,1
Very good food first time being their i love the shop that u guys have at the entrance,5
excellent food and place but bad actitud of this man,4
"Excelent food, Excelent service",5
"Popular spot located a short drive from the strip.

Entrance is a small shop with candy, clothes and other trinkets/souvenirs.

Plenty of parking for vehicles of all sizes including semi trucks. The restaurant itself is large with plenty of seating available. Staff was friendly and the food was phenomenal as always :)",5
Very good,5
"My favorite breakfast joint. Cheap and very good. And they bent over backwards to make my steak right....
I eat there as often as I can..",5
This place was awesome. I loved it. Our server Sonya was great. I think that was her name.🤠,5
They have good old country food and man is it good generous portions too bring the family it's worth it !!!,5
"The food was tasty, the service was good, but the complimentary biscuits and corn muffins were cold, hard and dry.",3
"This place is awesome, had never been before. Reasonably priced and good proportions. Our server ROBIN, was the absolute best.",5
"My food was cold. North Las Vegas off Craig street.  Had breakfast ordered eggs south west sausage hash browns biscuits and gravy. Coffee. Biscuits and gravy, coffee was warm everything else was cold hash browns came out late and cold. Never had that experience at any other of your restaurants up here here for duel of the desert race",2
"After waiting almost an hour, I told the hostess that my 2 year old was getting hungry and to check on a table she was do you want me to remove you from the list. When I asked to check a table, her response was 20 to 30 more minutes,  and do you want me to remove you from the waiting list. I left with my daughters and is a shame because my oldest love that place. They lost a customer. This happened on 1/31/21",1
This place was mobbed.30 min wait. For what.The food is average.The service barley average. Very unique gift shop. Good location but very busy noisy Craig Blvd.near I 15. Lots of parking. Personally I would go to I hop.,3
Amzing place. amazing food,5
"Today my family decided to eat at this restaurant, but little did they know that it was the worst decision they had made! Upon waiting to be seated, a physical altercation transpired, and another customer attacked one of my family members. The family member who was assaulted has a mental illness, and I understand that his intentions were misunderstood due to the situation. He never meant ill will, and the way the man came after him was extreme. However, the way staff handled the situation was unacceptable. Once the altercation was over, we were told to leave. Which was not an issue if everyone involved was told they were no longer able to stay. The CAUCASIAN man and his family were sat at their table after this incident. At the same time, we were told to leave the premises due to the situation. Mind you that he was the one who hit and assaulted my family member. This man was on top of my family member and was fighting a person who could not defend himself. As a person of color, it is hard not to see racial discrimination when the person (white man) who assaulted my family member gets to stay and is able to enjoy their meal. It is unacceptable that we are still dealing with this type of behavior. As a mental health advocate, I strongly recommend their staff and SECURITY guard to attend some type of training when dealing with people who have a mental illness or some kind of disability. There is no longer an excuse as to why a person is ignorant! If this restaurant gets one thing out of my post, it is to educate their workers on how to properly approach difficult situations and consider that just because a person looks ""normal"" they may have underlying issues that are not presented physically.",1
"Service has definitely suffered through Covid.  Our waitress was nice, but overwhelmed.  She was one of two waitresses and was bussing her own tables.  Food is generally good.  Eggs suck.  I believe they use water to get flat eggs.  The check out process is terrible.  One cashier for a busy Sunday.  And she was unpleasant.  So I wait 10 minutes to cash out and she has an attitude.?  You need better staffing for a better experience.",3
Scrambled eggs are not supposed to be runny..,3
"The waitress was friendly and nice. The food was good, I'll go back.",4
Staff was amazing at this location. We were greeted with a smile when we entered the restaurant. I asked to sit near the fireplace and she did just that with no hesitation. We had a bad experience with a restaurant in Florida and Emily along with the cooks restored our faith. Thank you so much Emily for being so sweet and kind. Also thank you to the manager in charge for making sure we were okay during our visit there tonight.,5
"Abysmal service.  Bad manager.  Alas, food was still good.",2
"Had lunch with my mom... First time dining at this location... Great waitress, and just all around friendly staff from the restaurant to the gift shop",5
"Excellent as always. In my opinion, this is one of the best breakfast joints around. Everyone was very friendly and the food was quite good, especially the country fried steak!",5
Grits and bisquits were almost room temperature and butter too cold to melt in either one. Food overall tasted great but none of the food was hot. Only warm. Staff was great.,4
"I love the service and I love the breakfast pancakes, and the fish on Friday. Cracker Barrel  is my favorite spot.😏",5
My food must have been cooked together all my meat had the same yeast. My bacon did not taste like  bacon my sausage did not taste like sausage same with the ham and fried egg. The only thing that did not yeast like the rest was my 🥞,2
Love eating here and the Turkey and dressing on Thursdays is the best ever! Also love getting my chow chow here.,5
Was seated at a dead table. Took 20 minutes for the manager to come out so we could get a waiter. The food was terrible. I got Turkey with was dry. I got a mashed potato asked for extra butter. The butter they brought out was colder than the ice cream.  The waiter didn't check on us. We barely got refills on our drinks. The manager went MIA so we couldn't complain about anything. He only came out after we got up to pay. The only person that felt genuinely sorry about our whole experience at that location was the cashier.,1
I will not go here again.  No stars for this place. Negative 5 stars.,1
The best place for breakfast,5
"Great Staff, service was excellent!! Quick to refill drinks and bring the check... No reservations required but recommendation of joining the waiting list online!!",4
To get a table go to crackerbarrell site and leave name and check in much faster for a table,5
8am on a Saturday morning and getting told a 15-20 minute wait because of “wait staff”. Restaurant is 3/4 empty. Welcome to Biden’s America.,1
You haven't eaten good food since the covid-19 Warriors a place,5
"As always great food, and exceptional service",5
"Disappointed. The food quality was much lower than most Cracker Barrels we have been to. The service was friendly but mostly missing. The ""outdoor seating"" was on the front patio on a very busy, and very loud expressway. Not our expected consistency.",2
"Love this place for.good food and selection. Large menu choices and daily specials, however... I guess I should be grateful on Thanksgiving places are open, but now with FingCovid There was a very limited Thanksgiving menu only. Still good..",4
The food was okay. It inspired me to make meatloaf. The wait time was way to long. They should not say 10 -15 min if it's going to take 25-30.,3
"Always good food at reasonable price, with great service.",5
Worst place I ever eaten. Food sucks. Service was good. Eat at the in and out burger next door.,1
A travel staple for us!! Always good!!,5
Best meal ive had in a year service was outstanding,5
Good Food ..Still has the Signature Store and the Scratch made Gravy.,5
"Ordered family fried chicken meal. Their chicken is excellent, crunchy but not greasy. The whole family enjoyed it.",5
"Lacks consistency-server was bland and unable to anticipate table needs. Maybe some training so she becomes more efficient and friendly.  Grits were warm at best, toast was hard and very dark, bacon was missing w/only serving 1/2 pieces. Coffe cup full of ground. Love the concept and love the Pittsburgh locations but sad this one is below par often. Gift shop wonderful all the time.",2
I enjoy the food that cracker barrel I have never eaten there before the food was awesome I hope I get a chance to come there and eat some more from Los Angeles,5
Food was great and I really like the new interior design compared to the others I've been to.,5
"I know that everyone has their opinion regarding each restaurant but I had a wonderful experience. First time coming to this restaurant and it was a marvelous experience. Loved the food and the service.
I will come back. Thank you!",5
"This is a great place to eat. The wait is very long right now. Not sure I think it's good enough to wait an hour for. Staff are kind, and the manager has came by asking if we enjoyed our meal every time I've been to this place. I love the consistent good food and staff",4
Terrible food and took forever. Only thing that was good was the Sour gummy worms from the store. The boomers got it wrong this time.,1
"The french toast was great, and i love the coffee. It’s was a bit slow, maybe because we went during the changing shift or they short of workers...",5
"We came here at 4pm on a Monday and it was packed. We were seated at the bar and it was fun to watch the chef hand pulled noodles.

We each ordered a bowl of noodles, plus the beef pancake cakes. The noodles were delicious. The pancakes were yummy but too small. I wish there was more!

The ambience was great. Modern and hip.",4
"Julie, our waitress, was awesome and the food delicious as always.",5
Good service and my family's go to upon arriving in this area,5
First time meal was very good and service great by James in Vegas on Craig by 15 fwy,5
"I enjoyed my lunch even though my first choice of the country fried turkey was sold out. Our waiter Paulos was great! We were at the location in North Las Vegas, NV.",5
My favorite place to eat and shop.,5
"Instant mashed potatoes sticky like glue, green beans were completely mush and greasy and biscuits like hockey pucks. Cracker Barrel has always been my go to for guaranteed good food.  So dissapointed.",1
"Get to know the staff here and they will remember you and your preferences. Great Value,  Great Service. A little overwhelmed by customer demand at height of Pandemic.",5
"Friendly staff, hot food, and great prices.",5
Good food and excellent service. We had placed our name on website to be wait listed. We only waited less than 5 minutes to be seated upon arrival. Happy holidays all!,5
"Good service, good food.",5
"So good, hard to avoid the tasty carbs. Must haves are the fried chicken & chicken fried pork chops",4
"Good food, great service",5
"Just like the couple of other Cracker Barrels that we have visited in other states like Colorado & Texas. Same layout very familiar, great service & food",5
"I love this restaurant, the service is always good the waiting is never ever that long, the atmosphere is pleasant; and the store always carries such beautiful merchandise. the waitresses and the waiters, the entire staff are are always pleasant and they make you feel very welcomed.",5
I got the rainbow trout and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned at a great price.,5
"If it's comfort food you're looking for, this is where you'll find it! I'll tell you what, no matter what dinner you get, ALWAYS order the loaded baked yam as your side. Only costs about a dollar extra, but is worth more like $20 lol. Oh, and the Saturday night special of smothered fried pork chops..... Amazing is all I can say",5
I’ve been to MANY Cracker Barrel’s across the country  and by far this particular one is the best overall. The staff from the minute I entered the door greeted me like royalty. And if your extra lucky you’ll get Zachary as your waiter. That dude is the man! He was basically the cherry on top of an already amazing cake. Don’t even waste time thinking on where to go for breakfast...This is your place. ;),5
great food and amazing environment!,5
The country boy breakfast was great,5
"Service was excellent. If you like fried food, it's the best.",4
"Love It. Not no problems, enjoyed.",5
"We came here for early lunch on Sunday during our weekend Vegas trip. We were seated quickly and drink orders quickly taken, which was nice. We ordered the signature chicken and waffles, and biscuit brisket to share. The brisket was juicy and fill of flavor, and the biscuit was perfect. The pickles really added to the flavorful bite, just fantastic. The chicken was crunchy and juicy and nicely seasoned; we got half of a chicken with the order which was plenty to share for two. The waffles were also crunchy, but it was a bit too thin and not substantive enough, and it was cold instead of warm. The syrup though was very tasty, not too sweet and just right. There was also a sauce that came with the chicken was tasted like tobasco sauce, a nice compliment to the chicken, although the chicken was tasty enough without it.",4
The service was average and the price reasonable. There is defiantly a limitation on healthy menu items but this isn't that type of place. Overall I enjoyed my dining experience.,4
Good food shrunk the menu though,4
Great meal that was well cooked.  Piping hot when it came out to our table.  Our hostess Sonia was a true  professional and provided our Family with great care and attention.  Highly recommend this Cracker Barrel restaurant.,5
"Experience was nice, but I am not a huge fan of their food.",3
CB is absolutely superb! I had the meatloaf dinner for $9... It was excellent and I got totally full... Vegas winner every visit!!!,5
Our server was so pleasant and courteous.  Just a bit of southern cooking is what my soul and belly needed - mmm chicken and dumplings,5
"They have all the""old school candy!""",5
The food and staff were absolutely wonderful loved it very much!,5
"This review is not spam or fake. A black woman today went to this location in search of a highly sought out merchandise piece. She waited for 6 hours for the restock. A white woman then walked in who had not been waiting, got them, and management did nothing. This is unacceptable. I will be taking my business elsewhere.",1
"I have never experienced such bad food at a Cracker Barrel. The fried chicken seemed to be leftover from lunch, it was barely warm and the coating/batter had hard pieces on it that I literally couldn't chew, my mashed potatoes were also cold, also our biscuits and corn muffins were so cold the butter wouldn't even melt. Unfortunately I don't think that I'll return to this restaurant.",1
Always happy with the food and service.,4
"Hour wait after being told 40 minutes. After being seated took 20 minutes just to get our drinks. Than was told while waiting that they were at full capacity but on the way out they opened up about 6 more tables.
Told management just an apology was given.",1
Great meal...great service,5
Love cracker barrel. Never disappoints.,5
The food and service was good. The menu items are very disappointing. There are no low carb options,3
Yummy food for a good price.,5
It is definitely a great place to go if you are looking for a good inexpensive meal. The waiter was super nice and was always one step in front of us when it came to our wants and needs.,5
"My catering order was good but the email says let us know when you've arrived and so I click on it and it says ""thank you for letting us know you're here we'll be out shortly."" 15 minutes later I walk in and people look at me like a deer in headlights that I said I was there for the curbside pickup. Ugh 🙄 why are some companies so efficient at this covid thing and others well....",4
We had great service there and delicious food,4
"Good service, would definitely come back for a quick meal",3
Waitresses are nice. Food comes fast. Clean.,5
"Quite average, but we did have a very good waiter.",3
"Very good place
Food is good.
I like the store.
Very good prices on food and store",5
Always a good meal at Cracker Barrel wherever you are. Gumby approved.,5
Very good food and great service!,5
I love their food! The catfish was awesome! Breakfast anytime. Yep. Great place,5
"Been looking forward to eating here for quite awhile. Well, I was very disappointed. I ordered biscuits and gravy, bacon not crunchy or over cooked, side of hash brown casserole, coffee. Waitress said she will keep an eye on the bacon so it's not burned.  Waited awhile for my breakfast, was never asked if I want more coffee, my breakfast arrived and I noticed the bacon was not quite burnt but not how I like it!  Tried to cut up my biscuits, but found them hard! The gravy was semi warm. The hashbrown casserole wasn't warm at all! Either this sat up on the shelf for awhile after it was cooked or I got someone else's meal kept warm! I DON'T like to send my food back as you don't know what they do to it! She definitely did not do her best to make me happy to come back. Oh yeah never asked if I need sugar with the 1 cup coffee! I left so dissatisfied, told my Son I will never go back. He also said he didn't care for them also. Next time IHOP or DENNYS!",1
"Food was great everyday, we ate there 3 times",5
Food was good.  Store is cute.  This location has better food than the other locations in Las Vegas.,5
Food and service was excellent. Very happy with all. Thank you!,5
My first time trying Cracker Barrel and it was all of the good things I have heard about. Great food! Great service! Loved the little country store.,5
great service and really good food.. the portions are a little small but i really enjoyed myself,5
Great place to eat good food,5
Super friendly staff and definitely handling things safely in the front of house. I can't stress enough how awesome and nice the staff were. The food looked great but it was bland and unseasoned. I think that's how it's supposed to be. Bring your own seasoning and this definitely becomes a 4 star experience.,3
Great food and some items we had not seen in a while will be going back soon,5
"Great food and lots of it. I never go that I don't buy clothes, their buyer is great.",5
"We dined here on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The server's were very friendly and upbeat, even on a busy day!
The food and selection are always consistent from one Cracker Barrel to another, so there's no surprise here.
The restaurant is probably about 50% larger the your typical CB location, so it's able to accommodate the larger crowds.
Overall, a good experience, good food and attentive service. This is a well managed and maintained restaurant!",5
They have the best chicken fried steak. Omg the best.  Services are great.,5
Oh man best pancakes your gonna get. Taste homemade and its some good portions for breakfest.,5
Awesome food and service.  Waitress Stacy Great customer service skills.,5
Good service and good food,5
My boyfriend and I loved it. It was our first time going today and every single person we talked to was very nice. They have great customer service. And their food was really good. I think their Mommas Pancakes were the best I've ever had. We'll definitely be coming again!,5
"Yes, yes, yes!! Awesome menu, chill vibe, historic Fremont Street!  This is a foodie spot! A destination - just look at the menu. Red velvet waffles? Bacon wrapped dates? The Mac and Cheese bites are house made. Come here and eat! This place looks like nothing special and you can easily walk past, but don't.

The crab artichoke dip came piping hot with an incredible cheese crust! It's loaded with crab, artichokes, and was seriously rich and creamy!

The devils on horseback were a little over cooked, but still delicious. The bacon was crispy, dates warm and soft and the sauce had a slight heat.

The Cuban disappeared! Moist pork and house picketed onions!",3
Not a great place would recommend somewhere else  Food was cold and took a long time to reach my table not That great quality food either And the ranch dressing tasted horrible on my salad. The prices and deals were boring lil tiny cheap paper menus u could hardly read not very good better off going to chilli's  You will be a lot happier when you leave.,1
They messed our order up but I ate for free. Thanks America.,4
I love this place and there so nice to me it’s so cozy and warm and very nice hospitality to have breakfast lunch and dinner or just to have a homemade snack and shop and  I love eating all the time here thank you cracker Barrel’s,5
Chicken pot was very good. Service was also good. Hadn't been there in a long time because last time food was just mediocre. Much better this time.,4
"The greens was AWFUL taste like they were only cooked with water,no seasoning.",2
Food came out cold and the server seemed kind of lost.,3
We love this Cracker Barrel. Very clean. The employees are really nice. The food is great. You wont be disappointed.,5
Food and service is great. BEWARE WHEN BUYING TOYS FROM GIFT SHOP!!! Some toys are misleading especially the Lego knockoff. It has a big box for legos and its filled by dangerously small mini legos that even the age recommendation is questionable.,5
Food was good! I like coming here.,4
"Introducing... Iced French Toast Latte, for the coffee lovers!!! Delish!",5
Love the spread of food. Only once the waitress forgot the complimentary biscuits n gravy. But every other time great food great service.,5
Absolutely perfect. Kristen was great n food was delicious.,5
My family and I happily accepted the free corn bread and biscuits. Can't wait to return for breakfast.,5
The food here is bland. No flavor at all,1
"I called asking a question and Mabel answered, she wasn’t very helpful and rude.",2
"This Cracker Barrel is yummy. They have attentive staff who are willing to do the most for you. I enjoy going here and eating with my husband. The clothes in the store part are super cute, slightly pricey, but not overly expensive. They have sale clothes for kids as well. I really like this place.",5
"Have always loved Cracker Barrel. Good traditional country home cooking. Prices are about average, the service is great at this location, and the restaurant was very clean (covid clean).",5
"We want to patronize this resto to support them inspite of the problems we encounter but service in this resto is becoming worse and worse. This morning was the worst, server is just so inattentive and the manager don't seem to care. I really lost my appetite.",2
This is the first time I can honestly say our server wasn't Cracker Barrel quality. The food was great!,5
When ever family comes to town we always go there.,5
"We were seated and then waited about 15 minutes with no server showing up at our table. I told the guy that seated us and he ended up taking care of us. Not sure who, if anybody was supposed to do our table but we appreciated the guy who helped. The food however was real good.",2
"We tried ordering using their APP and getting curbside pickup.  Using the APP to order was a poor experience.  We ordered Grandpa’s Delicious Breakfast and there was no indication that we would get grits, biscuits or sauce nor was there anyplace to indicate any personal presences like extra butter, or corn muffins instead of biscuits, etc.

The APP said our order would be ready in 15 minutes and that we should call the store to confirm that we were there.  We did that and the person said she would bring it out to us.  30 Minutes later we called again to see why we hadn't gotten our order.  It was ready but they'd neglected to bring it out to our car.

Bad APP and poor service.",2
"Great spot my husband and I love to go for date nights, the cherry soda is our drink so for sure try that out if they hadn’t sold out of it. Affordable pricing you get a good size serving, they have the cutest baby bottles of syrup which is their brand and there’s a mini shop in there where you can get a bigger bottle.",5
Good food as always young man that seated us not so much he got angry because we changed our party from 6 to 7 could have a 5 star.,4
"First the check and then the food. Bad service,  wit 20 min for a slice of lemon for my water and still waiting, lol.",1
I think I had too much fun in the gift shop. They have old school toys/TWISTER!!!!!,5
Food was standard and music was loud but our waitress Katina was AMAZING!,3
Not as good as the average barrel but its ok i guess,3
"As far as buffets go, this one is top notch. We went on a Wednesday night for dinner with 6 adults and 2 small kids and it was a pleasant experience.  It appeared that the wait through the normal line was about an hour, luckily we had a Seven Star member with us and we were seated within about 10 mins.  Their loyalty lines definitely help with the wait times.  The food selection was diverse as well as delicious.  The only fault I noticed, as other have, is that they are no longer offering oysters.  I heard they may have had a health scare in the recent past.
Our service was very good, with plates cleared quickly and refills poured as required.  Their Red Sangria was pretty tasty, but not sure I drank enough to warrant the $20 All You Can Drink cost.  Overall, a great buffet.",4
Excellent food and service!,5
"Sat. afternoon food is limited, so between 1 and 2pm, would not recommend",5
The wife loves this place. Pancakes are also great!,4
"The customer service here is horrible and lacking manners. We just moved here to Vegas from Hawaii and our household goods have not arrived so we have to rely on take out for now.  We are a family of 5 plus a 5mo old in the same household. We just wanted to have a nice family dinner. The older lady at the hostess stand said she could only seat 5 and we would have to be separated. I started to explain our little one was only 5mos old but she kept interrupting me, shaking her head and saying over and over ""They will shut us down"". I finally interrupted her and said ""could we just be seated please."" She sat us separately but after a couple of minutes we just left because we all felt we were not welcomed there and we were not looked at as customers but as interruptions to their day. Cracker Barrel has always been a place for a family to go out and have dinner together and and I will still continue to support their business but it will never be at this location again. I will go to a location that actually wants customers.",1
"Good dinner.  Fun,friendly staff",4
"Attentive and nice staff
Food was wonderful",5
I work there and eat there also shop its great,5
This place is just average although the store is always the best part! Right now its difficult to properly review places because everything is faulted by covid- asked for iced tea with lemon and a side of gravy and got neither- my server was a sweetheart doing her best though so no fault of her own- Im sure! I will return again with hopes of better service-,3
"Great service. The food was flavored and delicious.
Theres no better way to start of Mondays",5
Great service in spite of being short staffed,5
The food was really good 👍,5
We like it here & normally its top notch. This visit however...it took forever to be waited on & even longer to be served. Order was wrong & food was cold.,2
Simple meal wasn't pricey good service,3
Great food. Followed all covid guidelines,4
Slow service and didn't get my order right,3
"Simple, close to homemade meals, sweet tea is a must. Biscuits & corn bread are always good. The sizes are more than enough even for the hungriest guests.",5
It is a very cozy place with excellent food and pleasant treatment,5
"The home style chicken dinner looked like the advertisement and was nice and hot. I liked the flavor of everything. I had cooked baby carrots and they were a little sweet. The mashed potatoes had body and held the gravy. Even the lemon aide was good, not too sweet.",5
"I ordered the breakfast sampler which was not very good.The ham was very salty and tough,the sausage was dry and hard.The coffee was very weak and the rest of the meal cold.Would not recommend.",2
"I normally love Cracker Barrel but yesterday I was so very disappointed! My family went through a nightmare on thanksgiving day just to get the food , traffic was insane ! then after they drove across town to get home they discovered that all the side items were missing ! they must make changes on the holidays to allow traffic to get through easier ! Total disaster !",1
"Alberto is absolutely a great server, wonderful personality",4
Cracker Barrel is always a trusty go-to but I feel like it's lost some of its food quality. Service was good but food was just okay.,3
Good food & service too!,4
1st time ever eating at one. Service and food was excellent. Definitely will come back.,4
Great food!  Good prices too!,5
"Like their food and store, but appear to be struggling under the COVID restrictions. Last visit wasn't up to par.",3
"Had dinner the other night here. I am a super big fan of the show and planned our dinner months in advance. The service was good and so wasn't the seating except it was far from the open kitchen..It is very loud in the restaurant and always fully booked.

We ordered ice tea after seeing the prices of alcohol. The drinks were not always kept up on but were very fresh and flavorful!

We did the pre-set menu and ordered scallops, beef welly, and sticky toffee pudding. The food was very good and filling. Expect to spend at least two hundred when dining here with two people.

It was a very special night for us and we were very much looking forward to it! Still thinking about the sticky toffee pudding because it was my absolute favorite!",3
"I Delivered   your Fried  Chicken to my Mom and friend s,they all said the Chicken  was over fine and Dry...they pushed  to side, and settled for yuh our potatoes .",1
"Dumplings were horrible flat like pancakes no meat, sauce was thin as heck when it should be thick",1
Super fast super nice great food,5
Not empressed at all.,1
The steak was great and I  love the gift shop! Great place to find unusual unique Christmas gifts!!!,5
Delicious 😋😋 I always love ordering from here!,5
Never have a bad meal here! Always very consistent. Check in online and hardly ever wait for a table. Service is great and very affordable for a family! The bonus is the great store with all kinds of goodies inside. We enjoy our visit every time!,5
"I have been to this location many times and today was the best service I've ever received.  Food is always on point. Tried the cheesy squash as a side and I hope it makes the regular menu, it was yummy.",5
Great food & service. My boyfriend and I ordered dinner I ordered the Sunday chicken fried chicken dinner and you got two pieces of the chicken and two sides it was wonderful I would go there again any time to eat that. They are really nice there the service is great,5
Food was good. Had to wait awhile to pay. Our waiter Remy was excellent!,4
"Bad food and portions. Service okay, not sure why people eat here.",1
If I could give zero stars I would. This place is horrible! We ordered online for pickup then got there a little early to pick up our order when a young lady approached our vehicle but didn't know if they were going to bring it out or if we had to go inside. She said she was going to find out and walked inside the restaurant and never came back. We waited about 20 minutes until our pick up time then went inside to get our order and they handed us a receipt and said we don't know when this will be ready. Mind you it was already past the pick up time given to us because the line was not moving either. They were just letting people stand there and telling everyone that they had to wait and were not giving out time estimates for orders. After other customers were complaining that they had been waiting for over an hour we decided to just cancel the order and get a refund. At first they told us they could not refund our order because it was paid for online and they gave us thier store number to call and get a refund. How stupid is that?! We asked for a manager and she stated that she fixed it and we would not be charged so we cancelled the order and left. Well guess what they charged us the full amount and didn't give us the money back. The manager Lisa lied about doing anything to fix the charge and now we have to jump through all these hoops to get our money back when we didn't even get the food!!! They charged us for services they did not provide then lied about voiding the charge!!! These people have no idea what they are doing and I will never go there or recommend anyone else go there!!!!,1
Don't know what all the hype was. Food was exactly as Denny's. No specialized dishes. I was kinda disappointed 😞,2
"Consistent, flavorful food...excellent service!",5
Good service good food.,5
"I always drive out of the way whenever there's a Cracker Barrel in a nearby or even not so near town.
I am a french toast and waffle kinda girl.
But I  ALWAYS  have the Pancakes!!!
Grandmas Special YUMmy.
We even sat out front and enjoyed a good ole rocking chair.
The server Nicole who brought coffee refills was a gentle kind soul with a bright smile and spirit.
👁❤🥞",5
"One of the few places in Las Vegas I have found southern fried chicken. It was so delicious. Our server, Lauren was excellent. The gift store brings back a lot of nostalgia. Overall a really fun experience.",5
I love the cracker barrel it is a great place to eat breakfast lunch or dinner or snack yum,5
Enjoyed  my meal at cracker Barrow yesterday,5
"Gordon Ramsey knows good food and his restaurant based on his hit reality show is no exception. On my last trip to Las Vegas my girl friend and I knew we wanted to go to one of Gordon's restaurants. I've eaten at Burgr and his Fish n Chip shop in Las Vegas before and both had left a lasting impression. When my friend told me she made reservations here, I was ecstatic as I saw on the menu, the infamous beef wellington. After watching so many videos and people on his show making this dish, I had to try it.",4
It was OK for my 1st time I will go back  And order something different from what  I had order the 1st time,3
Absolutely love the menu!   Wait staff was awesome.,5
"The service and gift shop are amazing but the food is really bad. Hard salty fried chicken, Dry hashbrowns casserole, soggy corn and a flavorless dry corn muffin. Cracker Barrel you can and should do better than this",2
"With health and safety procedures, it takes a minute or two longer to get your order - but the service is always awesome, and the food always flavorful.",5
"The hostess was very inviting and very efficient. The waiter we got was new but he was really trying. The food was pretty good and surprisingly inexpensive. My only complaint is the corn bread which was very hard and stale. I love the gift shop/store section. There’s all kind of candy, home decor, and clothes. The overall decor and feel of the place is very cute and homey.",5
Food wantnst   good,2
Friendly staff. Liked you can add your name to the waiting list. They do have inside dining.  Blueberry pancakes are my favorite.  I personally feel the ham and sausage patty are always overcooked.  Love the cheesy hashbrowns,3
The BEST customer service we have ever had here. I wish I remembered the waiter's name. He was fast and attentive and just GOOD at his job. The food was good but I was disappointed to see a smaller menu.,5
Food was really good,4
"They have change the menu.  But not for the better, it feels now like another denny's with a gift shop... Sad.",3
Good Country Cooking Meals,5
Birthday Dinner. Love the fried chicken and okra,5
Great good food. Good service. No lines @ this time. YUM YUM YUM.,5
"This is a great family restaurant with incredible service. The store is really nice with a lot of cute and unique items. The food is pretty good especially for the price. It's equivalent to good homemade food. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual which is something I prefer. I would recommend this place and will visit again soon. The only thing I would caution against is how hard the chairs are. If you have back problems, you might want to bring a pillow or something soft to sit on. They're solid wood.",5
I'm never disappointed with the food or service. It always hit the spot,5
Still the best and only place I will order and eat Country Fried Steak,5
Food was great . Service was great.,5
Terrible food /they made us pay for a meal that wasn't good and only two bites taken from it. Nice store attached is the only reason it gets one star!,1
Food was mediocre and our waiter was rude. I've been to Cracker Barrels before and this was by far the worst.,2
The atmosphere is nice but the staff needs a little work on how to serve. The food is really good and reasonable.,4
Love this place,5
"Great outdoor or indoor area with a sweet menu of lunch and dinner items.

Chips and salsa were very fresh!

Baked potato with filet was amazing with cooked vegetables. Next time I will try the steak! Everything on the menu looks great",4
"It was my first time eating here, we waited about 10 min. Our server was very outgoing and the food was delicious and filling.",5
Best breakfast,5
Great food and friendly staff.,5
The staff did an excellent job accommodating COVID 19 restrictions while providing a pleasant dining experience.,4
"We got up and eat after sitting there for 5 minutes with nothing to drink and children screaming their heads off. Stared the manager in the eye as he did nothing but ""observe the floor""",1
"Great food and service.  Though the bisquits and corn bread was hard.  Didn't appreciate seeung Christmas decorations up on Sep 15.  How sad!  Also, disappointed that they wouldn't honor a military discount especially since Nellis AFB is only a couple of miles away and on the same road.",4
"My kids love the hashbrown casserole and the breakfast options.  We like to play the peg game at the table and shop for old fashioned candies from our childhood.  Many unique gifts.  Cracker Barrel has down home favorites like meatloaf and cornbread muffins.  Their bathrooms are usually clean and tidy so it's a good place to stop on a road trip.  Downside is that there is usually a line to get in and also to pay the check.  Also, the tables and chairs are spaced pretty close together.  Decent place for kids and high chairs are available.",4
"Cracker barrel is a family friendly restaurant. We take are kids on the weekends when we have a chance. Their they have a little store you can look in or buy something before your waiter takes you to your table. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. The place is a country themed restaurant. The people their are kind and before you get your food they serve you cornbread and biscuits and you can but jam or butter on them.(optional)",4
First time eating here. The food was very tasteful & filled us up. Prices are awesome!!! Thank you for this experience. I will sure be back next time!,5
"An ok place..just not for a holiday meal...we went for Thanksgiving this year due to Covid...we got our order to go.  The stuffing was dry like sand, the cornbread muffin was also dry like sand.  The Turkey and Ham slice was ok..just too small of a piece, the yams were ok, but according the their website you were to get one other side of your choice.  I was one of 3 in my party and non of us got our extra side...that was included in the meal price.",2
"Good food, great service and friendly staff.",5
Our favorite dinner every Thursday night,5
"What is it about Vegas Cracker  Barrels and bad service?  I went in yesterday.  It wasn't busy.  Our waitress got our order pretty quickly, but it went downhill from there.  When she brought out our drinks she thought she had screwed up my drink order and brought me sweet tea.  I decided to simply take the ""sweet"" tea and not make a fuss.  It wasn't sweet tea.  She was just being an airhead.  The manager brought out our orders.  One of my sides was wrong, but it wasn't something that I wouldn't eat so I didn't mention it.  What the manager didn't bring was our bread.  That's not the first time that a Vegas Cracker Barrel has forgotten that.  I mean almost all their meals come with bread.  Of course when we realized it nobody was around.  Our waitress and the manager had gone into a black hole.  The waitress did finally come by and we mentioned the bread.  ""What, they didn't bring it?"" she said.  How could she not see the lack of bread on our little table?  She did bring some when we were pretty much finished our meal.  I could almost see these mix ups if they were busy, but they weren't.  Somehow whoever hires wait staff for CB here in Vegas doesn't do a very good job.  Similar problems for the CB on the south end of town.  Too bad, because I loved CB in Texas when I lived there and the one in St. George is pretty good too.",2
Everything was excellent 👌 👏,5
Terrible service terrible attitudes . its bad enough you have 20 20 behind us . these people keep it rolling .,2
we always love dining at Cracker.,5
Getting better,3
Great experience every time.,5
"Ordered online.  At first wasn't sure if I ordered at right place because my name wasn't up there. But then one of the I'm assuming managers came and listened to what I ordered and quickly figured out
That it used my Google Gmail",3
"Relaxed, country atmosphere. Nice shop with trinkets and food, with attached restaurant. Ordered cheeseburger and baked chicken lunch special. Great service, friendly, food was quite good. Nice easy location for access.",4
"Been here multiple times and they never fail with amazing staff and excellent service. Ashley was an amazing server and was able to give us what we needed without even having to ask for it. It may be crowded, most of the time, but it's worth it 👌",5
"This gift shop and restaurant is very cozy and welcoming. For the most part the food was very good. The manager and staff were very helpful and kind. The only downside to this restaurant is that there aren’t any booths, only tables, which are too small. I recommend the Grandma breakfast platter.",4
"Totally disappointed! There was a long line and a long wait.
I was disappointed in the service as well as the food.
Our server Katie continued to forget to bring beverages and side dishes.
It was Veteran's Day and we were celebrating my hubby and niece for their service to the country.
Cracker Barrel had free  special beverage and or dessert for Veterans.
Katie was unaware of the SPECIAL, promised to check on it for us, however she forgot and when we reminded her of it, they had no more available at the time.
WOW, no Mac & Cheese before 11am and nothing given to Veteran's (NO APOLOGIES NOR CONCERNS FROM OUR SERVER)
Totally unacceptable!
Unhappy, no plans to return, bad service not very tasty food.
Maybe we should have just purchased souvenirs from the very interesting souvenir shop (and skipped the dining)",1
Simply great,5
It was do good. Best country cooking and great service,5
Saturday special was amazing!,5
"Fast and friendly service,great food",5
Service was slow but worth it.,4
"For the most part the food was really good. And the prices are pretty reasonable. Only reason why I took a star away, because almost every breakfast meal comes with grits, and even though I'll eat that on occasion, I've actually said I didn't want grits and they still served it to me and said that they come with every meal no matter what. I kind of don't know a restaurant that forces you to have something you don't want even if it comes with it. But it was good, other than that I do recommend you give it a try.",4
"Got food poison and I jst gottn better , gigt shop amzg gifts and gifts you can buy .
BUT I NEVER EAT FROM THERE AGAIN",1
Food was extremely bland and lacked seasoning!,2
"It was my first time to goes there in Cracker Barrel for my family and it was epic awesome, the waitress is very friendly and people who work there too. And also there cool stuff to the shop. Definitely wanted to go there again👏👌
We gave this waitress a tip, a great tip🙂",5
Good prices and good  country cooking.,5
"The place feels like a very cozy country home. The meals are absolutely amazing, my favorite are the pancakes, The southern style fries chicken, cooked cabbage, the casserole home style potatoes loaded, the fresh flavoured teas are amazing, the coffee is great but my favorite drink is the cafe latte.. You can choose different flavors like vanilla, caramel, and hazelnut I believe..i mean everything is absolutely amazing. The reason I'm only giving it a 4 star is because they took too long for service and didn't come back to check on us for a while each time they left. Other than that everything was great. Also I would like to mention that the shopping store they have is unbelievable you can find almost everything you need, and everything it's beautiful. I recommend it 100%😍😊 loved it, loved it, loved it.",4
Enjoy the food and the special treats in the store. Service is good. Only wished they gave military discount.,5
Not that good black bear restaurant is weight better,1
"The food was good and our waiter was very friendly and attentive to our needs. However, we had to wait over an hour for a table despite there being several vacant tables inside the restaurants. After noticing that people arriving after us were being seated before us, we brought it to the attention of the hostess, who told us that ""our table was being prepared"". Only after asking to speak to the manager, were we finally seated and able to enjoy our meal.",3
Always a great meal at CB,5
Wonderful staff.,5
2 of my ordered food item was served uncooked. 😒,2
Great good! The chicken fried steak and gravy was definitely my favorite!,5
The wait time was 10 minutes. Our waitress Stacy was nice & friendly. Food was good but the biscuits seemed much smaller than what I remembered.,5
Food is excellent!!! A little too crowded.,4
"This is the best food and the cleanest, most courteous place I can think of. I have never been disappointed. If there is anything to complain about it would be that they give us more food than we could possibly eat in one session. We love this place.",5
Food was great. Was surprised their hash browns had chopped onions. The breakfast sampler was a good choice. Would go there again.,5
Ok,3
"Very friendly, nice atmosphere, clean restaurant. General/ gift store. Great staff. Quickly waited on. Was able to get food that was requested even some that was not included in the the menu! Definitely suggest a return visit for myself and others!",5
"Just really great & nice employees there.  Foods great, that's why they are always busy.",5
Great place to eat. Usually has decent service and good food. Also has a good take out system for the pandemic life.,5
"One of our favorites.  Great food, good prices, well trained staff; we look forward to having lunch here again.",5
Good Food! Hate the parking lot because of In and Out.,4
Fried Chicken was awesome! Dumplings and Mashed potatoes were awesome. I felt bad for the server he was slammed with 3 new tables at once. Poor guy was doing his best. I did speak with the manager on duty and explained they were setting the poor guy up for failure. The Manager appreciated me taking the time to talk to him. good job Cracker Barrel crew! I will be back for sure!,5
Very gracious to let us park there overnight in our RV. We love cracker barrel.,5
"It has lots of good stuff, but there isn't much space to move around. The store is extremely cluttered. The restaurant is very nice though!",3
Friendly staff.  Workers were wearing mask. Great portions of food 👍,4
"Homestyle Fried chicken is delicious, but the potatoes and gravy were cold and clumpy.  Asked to have it heated, came back 5 mins later still barely lukewarm and clumpy.  Gravy should never look like brown jello...   Health dept. should go through with a thermo imo...",2
"Tried the Cod for the first time,  with a bake potato & fried okra was pretty good.",5
Food was great neat store inside with good prices,5
Love the comfort food!! Everything I had was delicious and satisfying to my soul. And at reasonable prices. Had the chicken fried chicken and loved the sawmill gravy. And can't go without having the creamy hashbrown casserole. Ready to go back to try more.,4
Great Service and reasonable prices.,5
Great food good price,5
"I just love Cracker Barrel the food and little shopping area, and the staff I can't say enough about always warm and welcoming.",5
Very good service waiter I think his name was tony a very nice person excellent worker.,5
ate take out today.was suppossed to be curbservice but was told cause used postmates don't have curbside? was on their website?my meal was terrible ate in their parking lot.was luckwarm and tasted like it was reheated.my wifes meal was good but nothing to write home about.we won't go back!,1
"Great ambiance, nice family style restaurant, great selection of food. Food tastes ok, not like it used to on previous visits. The serving size is small at best, very bland, and had me wondering why I chose this over ihop. Like I said, this place used to be great! I guess its only great in certain states or areas in your town. Disappointing at best, edible but not worth the time to eat it.",3
"Nice family place with good food. I used to go there when I lived in the Midwest so it has that familiar feeling going to the Las Vegas one. The store has old style games and at the tiles they have that pyramid game. It's nice to see kids trying it instead of looking at their phones. Food was good, came out quickly, and servers were nice and helpful.",5
Service good.,3
"First time here, wanted to see what all the hype was about.

Pretty sparse breakfast menu, in my opinion. And fairly basic. The fried apples sounded interesting, but went for a slightly smaller (sounding) meal.

The server right off the bat got our basic beverage order mixed up and gave my friend my water and her iced tea to me. There’s 2 of us...

Ordered some basic eggs and meat and sides. When it came out the runner gave my food to my friend hers to me... and somehow my over easy eggs were on her plate and her over medium on mine. So service is sub par at best mid morning Thursday when it’s not busy.

Now the food. Terribly disappointing! The portions are tiny! “The fixins” consist of a tiny bowl of grits and two almost burnt biscuits with a tasteless grey gravy.
My eggs, of course, were the wrong ones. The sausages I got? Tiny little pucks of over salted, over cooked red meat. To top everything off they never offered to bring hot sauce or anything. I had to go steal it from a dirty table.
Did I mention it was like $10 after tax for all this?!?

Truly unimpressed. There are so many better breakfast joints around. Will not be returning.",2
Food is always Great! Did the Fish Fry tonite enjoyed every bit of it along with their Steak fries and Slaw.,5
"The staff was really nice and friendly, but one thing I really like about Cracker Barrel is that you can always count on the food being consistently good from one Cracker Barrel to the next. This Cracker Barrel was the exception. The food was not very good. It was bland and my chicken tenders must've been sitting under a heat lamp for hours, plus I think they were cooked in the same oil as the fish (or sitting next to the fish under the heat lamp). The hash brown casserole was several hours old and extremely dry and crunchy. The place was clean and the country store well organized. Everything was great...except the food.",2
The food was great and that I loved shopping in their little store area great gifts for birthdays coming up if they're younger kids,5
This was the worst experience I and my family have ever had. It took one hour and twenty minutes to be served our food and they forgot two meals. It took another ten minutes to receive our bread so a total of one hour thirty minutes. My chicken and my husband's was old oil. They told our son they had no more chicken after one hour and thirty minutes. The waitress didn't take the salad plates and old drink containers off the table. Then she forgot who had what and everyone got the wrong receipts. We found out later that the computers went down. She could have told us that but she didn't. The manager should have given us our meals for free. I love Cracker Barrel and it was our daughter in laws birthday. What a sad dinner.,1
"Wow! The best pancakes I've ever had, and they have this syrup that they give in individual bottles that is heated. Delicious! I also had the roasted chicken, on another visit. I didn't like it. The little country store in front had some cute things to purchase. They have this beautiful wood burning fireplace. I just loved my visit here.",5
"Great food, good quantities (reasonable) and friendly staff.",5
"Very clean. Very good service.
Fried chicken was not hot nor juicy.
Fries had been sitting.
Okra was very good.
Look at your ads on tv.",2
"Sat. June 8, 2018

I accepted a delivery for a customer from Cracker Barrel on Craig Road. Arrived at the location went to the pick up counter, that is located in the novelty shop side and let the cashier there know that I was there for pickup. She got the order name check in back they took a couple of minutes to come out with it and I took the order and went for delivery. Once I got there the customer asked about his drinks, which I did not recognize we're not with the order. So the Cracker Barrel restaurant had forgotten to add the drinks to the order and I also did not check to see if order had drinks, trusting that they had gotten it right. I told the customer that I will go back and retrieve his 2 Teas that were with you either. Once I got there the young lady wasn't there but the store manager was there tall white man with glasses little bit heavy set and I explained to him what had happened and that I was there to pick the forgotten drink order up. He never apologized for the mistake on their part he just yelled back to the young lady that made the order ""hey you messed up the drinks"". She finally came out, no apology as well she was cordial but it probably would have been nice. I also asked the store manager while the young lady was making the drinks if there was anything he could do for my client, he said no he'd have to take up that with the app. Long story short I have been a store manager and also worked at Wendy's as an employee in jobs passed, as a store manager I would do small gestures like, I asked him to do for my guests to Foster customer relations and build loyalty. It wouldn't have been that hard for him to give my client say coupon or voucher for two free drinks on next visit or something like that. Very disappointed and the customer service and customer relations side of this location.",1
Reasonably priced big portions.. Servers are wonderful.. If u like southern cooking you'll love cracker barrel....,4
The food and staff were great. The issue i had was trying to make a reservation online. They do not accept phone reservations.,4
"The food was just okay.  My roast beef could have been a bit more tender and seasoned better.  The turnip greens were tasty but obviously they ration them. They were served in one of those little side dish bowls, which was far from full.  It looked as though they used a very small ice cream scoop to measure the serving size.  The baked sweet potato was good and the side salad was a side salad. I don't remember what my son ordered, but he ate it without comment. My grandson seem to enjoy his chicken nuggets with mac and cheese , but he is a 3 year old.  I tasted his mac and cheese and it reminded me of boxed. I would go back again and try something different next time.  The employees were very friendly and the service was quite good.  So I give them 3 stars for the food plus one for the service.",4
"Big Cracker Barrel fan so surprised to see negative reviews on Google for this location. However, I had a completely positive experience starting with Erik - the host - sat me and my daughter right away and asked me how my day was. He suggested the pecan pancakes to me, he said they were good. Guess what, I ended up ordering them and yes they were absolutely delicious. Ashley, our server was very attentive, but not pushy. Knowledgeable and just the right amount of friendly - you can tell she was genuine. Manager walked by during dining and checked on us and so did a senior waitress - she had 3 stars I think. We ate all of our food as usual, but happy to see real dollops of butter on our plates instead of the little bowl of plastic butter cartridges. Tasted much better. When we checked out... there was Erik again at the register. After I paid, he suggested I check out the gift shop. Guess what - I bought something, a gift for my wife that I had been trying to locate in San Diego for awhile - Peppa Pig TY beanie. Thoroughly happy and impressed with my visit. I like Erik there at beginning and end, really seals the experience and made it memorable. Great job.",5
"Lunch deals are amazing.
Alberto was a fabulous server. Very efficient and personable..",5
Food was nothing special. The fried chicken with honey looked great but nothing to write home about. Maybe breakfast is more the signature meal that i remember being so good. Neat store attached. Friendly folk,3
"I would've been really surprised if this had been less than five stars. They definitely know what they're doing. This was my first time at a Cracker Barrel, and it wasn't crowded. Service was fast. The decorations were nice and kitschy. I had the signature burger that was really good. My dad said the country fried steak was the best he'd ever had. The store had a lot of cool things to buy and I'll probably go here to buy Christmas presents for all of my family members that are harder to shop for. All around a good experience.",5
food was fantastic and the brand new server paulos was very helpful and accomodating,5
Good Food Nice Atmosphere,5
"Fried chicken tasted 2 days old!!! I picked up an order last night, the order time was for 8pm. I got there at 7:50 and my food was already sitting on the counter, looked liked it was there a while. I live 5 minutes away, when got home EVERYTHING was cold. My desert didnt have whip cream! No butter or honey for my bread! Ive had better chicken at the grocery store deli!!! I am verrry disappointed cracker barrell!!!",1
"Stopped by here with my gal for lunch as we drove through Vegas. For first impressions, this place did well. I attribute the great first impression to the hostess who was very knowledgeable and helpful. We told her we had never eaten there before and she was quick to give some good suggestions. The place was super busy and packed but our waiter was quick and prompt with the service. The restaurant was clean and orderly and the bathrooms were kept up well. The food was great and I will probably try the Cracker Barrel by our home now since the experience was pleasant. Thanks, had a great time here with my gal.",5
The service was pretty good. The server was a little scatterbrained but very sweet and pleasant. I enjoyed it. The food was good too. The only issue was the kitchen didn't pay attention to the food allergy alert and had to remake my daughter's food.,4
The restaurant was clean and very well staffed. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and even informed us about options not listed on the menu. Food came out and it was EXCELLENT. The gift shop was absolutely GREAT. I was able to purchase a lot of old school TREATS and the CRACKER barrel famous biscuits mix. Will be back over and over and over x2,5
"My boyfriend & I had a very good experience here. I believe our waiter was Frank (that was the name of the cashier on the tab), and he was unbelievably helpful. He was very patient and assisted both of us with our drink orders.

Everything we ate exceeded our expectations. I come back again and again each visit to Las Vegas. The lobster risotto is out of this world & omg the Beef Wellington is amazing.",4
Homestyle cooking at it's best.,5
"Speed of service: Excellent. We were promptly seated with no waiting on a Friday night
Food: Delicious
Service: Adequate. Our primary server was very attentive, kind, and thoughtful. She did send someone else out to take our order and I found her to be rude and impatient. We also weren't given napkins until halfway through our meal.

I'll go again if I'm in the area.",3
Great place...quiet clean serve some of the host can use a little brush up...management were great,4
"Picked up a ""pre-cooked"" Thanks Giving dinner. Looks good.....",5
Amazing food and even more amazing customer service from Zachary at the Craig location. Hands down best service my entire family has ever recieved. We gather with our family every weekend and most people do not like service large families. This is our new to go spot.The hour drive is going to be worth it every weekend now. Thanks Zach! We'll be requesting you each time! You're awesome!,5
Staff was extremely nice and food was perfect. Good prices,5
"Quality of food has gone down considerably, my baked potato was frozen, the manager was not very friendly.",2
Cracker barrel surprisingly is a very wonderful restaurant and if you've never been in one before I've noticed them throughout my travels for many years,5
"I've had a lot of Korean BBQ and this place is just great. The kimchi is spicy, the service top notch and the meats are fresh and flavorful. I had bulgogi and spicy pork and both were absolutely perfect!
It's tucked into a strip mall near the Hard Rock and is a small restaurant, unremarkable from the outside, but the atmosphere, staff and prices were all fantastic.
If you like Korean BBQ, this place is a hidden gem.",4
This is one of the best places to eat left. Every experience has been absolutely amazing! The servers are always so nice and really treat you like a human being. Our waitress was Rose with the 4 star apron and I couldn't say enough good things about her! Each time we visited we were Greeted and seated Immediately. The food was amazing and brought out quickly! Such a wonderful experience each and every single time! I 100% believe this is the last great place to eat! Way to go Cracker barrel!,5
"Arrived in Las Vegas after a l-o-n-g drive and headed for breakfast. The restaurant was clean, the staff and servers were friendly and the pumpkin latte was mmm...good!",5
"Went there Easter Sunday about 4:30 and as is usual at Cracker Barrel, we were greeted with friendly people. We were seated right away, which surprised me as it was a holiday. Someone came over immediately to take our drink order and she explained that our server would be with us shortly, and if not, she would personally come back and take our order. After a few minutes, the server came and apologized for taking so long and that she would be right back to take our order. We probably waited about 15 minutes at least for her to get over to our table to take our order but she was very friendly and apologetic. After all, it was Easter and they were busy. It took the food several minutes to come out to us as well and, again they apologized that it was Easter and the kitchen was a little backed up. There were a lot of empty tables, so not sure why they were so backed up unless they didn't expect the crowd that showed up and didn't have enough servers or cooks. Not sure, but once the food came out, it was good in the usual style of the restaurant. Unfortunately, though, by the time the food finally got there, my one year old granddaughter had had enough of the wait and was not going to sit through the meal, so we had to pack it up and take it home to eat. The store itself was great, clean, beautiful merchandise and the usual candy fare that you don't find just anywhere. Overall, I would go back again, without hesitation.",4
Staffs are friendly. The portion was moderate.,4
"What great people.  I just stopped by for a mess of turnip greens when I was a little home sick. From the greeters to the service by my waitress from back home in Memphis, I had a great time. Rebecca was wonderful and I will send everybody there after this great visit.",5
"Biscuits were so dry I couldn't get it down with sweet tea and gravy. Oh, sweet tea tasted like dirt water, the menu said hash browns and that's not what I got. It was nasty either way. Basically the scrambled eggs were the only thing I enjoyed. The orders came out messed up or missing for the whole table. Still charged full price.",1
Down home cooking for an affordable price.,5
"Best store ever,that food slap",5
Cracker Barrel was the best i will be returning everybody was courteous and nice especially my waitress Cameron I did not have to ask for refills anyting thank you Cameron,5
So good. Great atmosphere and beautiful restaurant with a country feel. Feels like you're not in Vegas.,5
Good food great customer service and lots of cool stuff in the gift shop to buy,5
The server Daphnee was great! Good food and sevice prices reasonable.,5
"Staff was friendly and mostly helpful, but a communication error led to our place in line almost being lost,  and one of our party recieved an incorrect order. I'm sure they were honest errors, but errors nonetheless.",3
Had a fun time with friends,5
"Was nice place but the breakfast i had was not good , maybe dinner will be next time i go. 2 strikes your out no 3.",4
"Excellent food at a good price. Our server, I think her name was Jordan, was very friendly and attentive to our table. Will revisit again. Thank you!",5
"Great breakfast...I feel better :,)",5
Food was delicious atmosphere was great 👍,5
Great place and  food,5
"We moved here from Illinois last spring and were really missing Cracker Barrel so  this was awesome! The food was really good but our server, she was absolutely over the top awesome! We were eating out to celebrate a birthday and she indulged all the craziness we had going on at our table. Definitely will visit this restaurant again!",5
Thanks for letting our three RVs park for the night. Loved the Santa Fe scramble!!,4
"It's good food and always busy. Not for vegans! However, I love their store, which is why I go. My friends were quite satisfied with their food and the service was great. An awesome place to take people and they do have special dietary menus. Just not if you're vegan. :)",3
"We enjoy going to Cracker Barrel.   The weekday specials are wonderfully tasty and good portions.  We especially like the Baked Potato and House Salad.
Today is. Friday and they have the Cod with French Fries , Cole Slaw and Corn Muffins only about $10.00 each.  I had plenty for a Togo box.  Crispy fried fish, seasoned just right.  Our waitress, Sarah was right there with anything we asked for.  Very nice store area.",4
"Went in there and the waitress seemed in a hurry. Maybe cause she was the only one working that whole side. Not section, whole side. I left her a pretty nice tip for her hard work. Food was ok. Not as hot as I expected it to be. Liked that the refills were free. Coleslaw was delicious. I liked the little shop that you go through to get to the restaurant. Cute things in there.",4
Yummy and inexpensive!,5
Ordered take out and when we got home we were missing our pancakes so we call to let them know. We want all our food to be hot so we ask to return what we have for everything fresh and was told no due to covid which we do understand but why do we have to suffer because of your incompetent employee.  Take the food back and give us all of our order the way we ordered it and paid for it!! Yes I am not happy with Cracker Barrel,2
Waited 20 minutes for refill on coffee and water. Waiter avoided us like the plague.,3
"I have to start off by saying, WOW! Not only was the food amazing but our server, Zachary made our experience hands down the best! Our family gets together every weekend for lunch and we've Never had better service Anywhere, and the location on Craig RD & 15 is our new favorite place to eat and we'll make sure to always request Zachary to be our server. We need more people like him in the industry and I sure hope this review gets catches the eye of upper management because he's phenomenal and should be recognized for his amazing customer service. 5⭐",5
This is my first time eating at Cracker Barrel. I can say the food was good. And the portions were okay for the price. I do have to admit that there coffee a good brew. I would have to try this place a few more times to see if I can actually like the restaurant. Not that it was bad. I can honestly say I prefer IHOP when it comes to breakfast.,4
"Good food, good atmosphere, wonderful service",4
Very clean with safe distancing observed for dine in. Food was good with nice portions for lunch. Skip the cornbread...very dry. Great service.,5
This was the second Cracker Batrel we went too. The employees were friendly and courteous. The service was excellent.,5
"Service was slow, food left under heat lamp and dried out when we received it.  Biscuits dried out as rocks.  Gravy sliced and spread like solid butter.  Over easy eggs were solid, french toast dried out like regular toast.  Very disappointing",2
Delicious!,5
"Never had an order come out right. Not one time. They forget entire parts of the meal and are never apologetic or do anything to fix it. Their wait staff is clearly untrained and cant handle a two top, let alone a group. It's a disaster every time. Plan on being here at least an hour even if you order right away. Food isnt even as good as other cracker barrels. I waited to leave a review after I came shortly after the grand opening in the hopes it was growing pains. It wasn't. Don't waste your time.",1
Love taking the family for a nice country meal.,5
Cracker barrel is amazing staff along with the incredible food to go with it I personally love their French toast and has the old school mom feel to it and you cannot forget about their amazing home style chicken to die for,5
"I come here all the time with my family, whether it's for breakfast or dinner. Love their menu! Their chicken fried chicken is delicious! My daughter loves their pancakes. Very clean overall, and great friendly service.",5
"Fine. Best word to describe my experience.
Food was fine. Service needs work. He only had two tables, yet napkins, refills, and ketchup took a long time to get. They had to 'find' the napkins in the back. Even the manager helped and it took longer than I think it should for a staple like napkins.

He was a nice server though. Price? Fine I guess. I don't think it was worth entirely what I was charged but I don't feel 'ripped off' either. Wondering why people I knew called this spectacular. Fine. Didn't hate it, didn't love it. Fine.",3
Ordered ahead food was ready but with missing items,3
Home cooked breakfast was exactly what I was in the mood for.  The staff was friendly and offered insight into the menu to help us choose when stuck between options.  Loved the pork chops and biscuits.,4
"Food decent; wait 130 minutes was totally unreasonable. Offer coffee have staff instead of standing around ...
Camryn was great.",1
"Great service. Great food, comfort country food.  Love the chicken-n-dumplings.",5
Chicken fried chicken is good,5
Server was good this time tipped him well,4
😋😋😋😋😋,5
I've eaten at other locations and had a better experience food wise  . But I will add that the staff was very curtious and helpful .,3
"Since this is during the pandemic I did not eat inside restaurant. The to go order took an excessive amount of of time to be prepared. While waiting, none of the other customers were wearing masks.  I find this to be criminal. I understand that wearing a mask is not compatible with eating, but waiting in line to pay, browsing the store area, this is a complete and utter failure of the restaurant to enforce the safety of its customers and employees. Wearing a mask is not political,  it's science. I will not go back to a Cracker Barrel again. If they're overlooking a basic health issue like masks, I don't have confidence in what practices they may follow in the kitchen out of the customers view.",4
Home cooking can't beat it!,5
"Food has definitely gone downhill in both flavor and portions. Used to be like ""made from scratch"" home style food but now not so much. Chicken fried steaks small & similar to frozen breaded chicken patties, biscuits were hard on outside while dougy inside, hardly any gravy. Waitress checked on us once and nowhere to be found when we were ready to leave. My birthday lunch was disappointing.",3
"Definitely the best restaurant that we dined at in Vegas so far: highly recommend the signature seared scallops appetizer and the rack of lamb ent, although the house favorite beef Wellington was also delicious.

While the grilled and seasoned asparagus was my favored side, the mac n cheese was also solid and could easily feed two people as a side, maybe three.",3
"I love Cracker Barrel, but recently it seems like a few things have changed on the menu.  They don't have the frozen apple cider anymore, and the hash brown casserole seems different too.  Our biscuits came out hard on the bottoms the last time we ate there too. Normally the quality is good, but the last time it was lacking.  I gave 4 stars because of our past experiences.",4
Nice friendly place.,5
"Never been to a Cracker Barrel before.  Decided to try something new.  Upon entering, you gaze at all kinds of Xmas ornaments as well as nostalgia type items.  What a display.  Restaurant another story.  Ordered our food, chicken tenders and catfish.  Tenders wasn't flavorful as other places.  The catfish was lacking some seasonings.  Corn muffins were hard like a rock and extremely dry.  The waiter, extremely rude.  Guess won't be going back anytime soon.",2
Great service great food loved it,5
That place is awesome.  I really the liked the food.😜My kids took me there for my birthday dinner. Cool place.,5
AWESOME AS ALWAYS!!! Love the food!! It's the one place you can get REAL home cooked meals when the wife doesn't want to cook 😂,5
Great food & ambiance.  Will be coming back now that i know its close to home!,5
They are doing their best during this pandemic. Everything was very delicious except the flavorless corn muffins.,5
Very nice place to eat good price for the money and nice store to buy things,5
Love this place,5
The butter was frozen.  Cornbread not warm.,4
"A bit of ""the Heartland"" right here in Sin City... You get a healthy portion of ""Americana"" at Cracker Barrel Restaurant. Good old comfort food at a fair price with a great little gift shop where you can take a piece of the Heartland home with you. A good assortment of unique country style gifts. You just can't go wrong here!",5
Great staff!! Good food!! Sweet and friendly and clean!! Good gift shop area too! Love the big rocking chairs!,5
"Friendly service, comfy atmosphere, and chicken and dumplins that I wish I could eat every day of my life. Also the hashbrown casserole is amazing, and the cornbread and the biscuits. I could go on, but just read the menu, everything on it is delicious. Go with an empty belly looking for warm comfort food and you'll leave stuffed and so very satisfied.",5
A little disappointing. The service wasn't bad but dinner was served before the salad was brought out. We never were offered drink refills on a $3 so-so ice tea. The catfish was OK but we won't be going back there any time soon. We only went because we had a gift card.,3
It was ok....not worth the wait for me....but staff was really nice,4
"If there  was an option for ZERO we would give it a ZERO.    Sausage patties dried up hockey pucks and cold.  Poached eggs?????  Hard boiled and brown, greasy color.  Blueberry pancakes were tasteless with soggy blueberries but no flavor.

It is not like us to complain, this was so awful we had to share.

Store is cute and service is good. Food is a big, fat NO WAY!!!",1
"Kinds pricey for the size of servings, not overly exciting food. But they did have good ham, they just dont give you much of it.  Kinda funny, they have big plates with tiny portions of food.",2
"New location. Our server was awesome. We went with our 7 and 3 year old boys. Our server understood the challenges of eating out with kids and was a huge help. Because we looked at the menu while we waited to be seated we were able to place our order right after we were seated. With how busy the restaurant was, our food came out quickly. The food is delicious and filling.",5
"Had breakfast here a week ago with my mom, and it was great. Our waiter was super attentive  and the food was amazing.",5
I really love the food and the staff,5
Amazing!,5
"My wife has ruined my pallet by teaching me how food should be cooked with flavors. The food here was very generic. Nothing had any real flavors, the bacon, biscuits and gravy, eggs and almost everything lacked any depth of flavors and tasted mass produced.",3
"Absolutely the worst take-out experience since this whole Covid thing started!  I called ahead and placed an order and was told 30-45 minutes.  I waited the full 45 before getting there and called on arrival and was told that it would be 15 more minutes and they would have it right out to me.  Long story shorter, I called back in to the store 2 additional times to remind them I was still outside and they finally brought the food out 45 minutes later.  When they brought it out I had to remind them I hadn't paid (really wish I had just driven away but I have this thing about stealing).  I asked about a discount for the wait, or military, or nurses but was told that there were no discounts.  Maybe another location has better service but I'll never know, unless you (gracious reader) tell me about, cause I will surely just go to IHOP next time.",1
Good food! Rather eat inside besides take out.,4
Breakfast was good.,3
"Good old time service.  Prompt,  fast and good food",5
"Wowwww!!!!😍 I've let this place slip through my hands!! Yum! I will definitely be a regular! I enjoyed my meatloaf and mac n cheese with coleslaw! The experience was one to be remembered. Waitresses were nice, restaurant was clean and full of happy people! Love it!!",4
"Great pancakes, but when it come to simple basic breakfast they take simple to the extreme. The eggs never cooked the right way, and as you can see in my picture, they are served with two small pieces of bacon and a sad slice of orange. You won't get full with this!!! But pancakes 100% delicious and plus they give you real maple syrup 💓",2
Great place to eat. I usually drink 1 cup of coffee but the coffee was so good I drank 3 cups and bought a lb bag to take home. The staff was awesome. I'm looking forward to going back often. I give them a A+ rating,5
We had a perfect time. Very satisfying. Although the fried turkey was not available. My main reason for coming. I was so influenced by the commercial. That was the only upset. Otherwise just a perfect choice for holiday meal..,5
"3 star food (the sweet tea is fantastic, the breakfast items are just ok, the biscuits are tasty) + 5 star shopping (fun experience to share with your family! Just warning you, some things can be pricey, I couldn't justify $40 on a random pretty blouse or skirt, but the decorations & miscellaneous finds are a good time) = 4 stars overall. Probably won't return for the food, that wasn't very memorable, but for the chance to go to the entertaining little store.",4
For many years me and my wife have eaten at a lot of Cracker Barrels across the USA. We always love the food and country store. And the people who work there.,5
"This is one of those places where, if you've been to one, you know what to expect.  This is home-style cooking, Southern comfort food.  I like the biscuits, chicken fried chicken, meatloaf, chicken pot pie, Sunday homestyle chicken, breakfast plates, and double chocolate fudge Coca-Cola cake with ice cream.  Fruit cobblers are also available.  It can get very busy -- you can get on its wait list on-line.  There is also a small shopping area attached to the restaurant with a variety of merchandise from specialty sodas, old-time candies, music, movies, clothing, etc.  Rocking chairs outside are available to purchase.  The service is generally pretty quick and courteous.",4
Food was great as usual and Sonia the server was awesome ‼️,5
They never answer the phone and they get your order wrong too.,3
"Great store in front, but the food was plain.",2
Great service good people,5
Food and service were both delightful!,5
"The service here is great, and they have a sizable gift shop with lots of unique stuff. The menu is expansive. But after having lunch here, I suspect Cracker Barrel is an example of a restaurant trying to do everything and the result is they don’t do anything great.

My wife had the grilled cheese, which just ok. Her vegetable soup was good though. My raspberry ice tea wasn’t so great. My “healthy option” chicken tenderloin include four chicken strips (not so great), carrots (not bad), and fruit (good but skimpy).

Maybe the comfort food options on the menu are better.",3
"Had a few minor issues with service but after speaking to the boss man Logan I knew this was a respectable establishment with a priority of customer attention. Logan won our respect and my hat's off to such a gentleman, a man of honor.  My family and I look forward to our next visit and by the way the food was terrific. I had the fish w/mashed taters and broccoli and it was lovely. Cheers.",5
"Food was good, it was like a home cooked meal!",5
"No problems, but nothing special either.",3
"Hardly no waiting, clean store, a variety of keepsakes, phenomenal staff, and good food.",5
Huge breakfast plate filled with great food. Great coffee as well!,5
Our server Sonia was amazing. Great service and amazing food.,5
"It just was not up to what I'd expect from a Cracker Barrel.
Took forever for anyone to take our order because our waitress was busy dealing with the table behind me, a group of 8 or so, and it sounded like their order was totally messed up and really the waitress just kinda shut down.
Eventually they got another waitress for us. Our order came out wrong. She remedied it quick enough though.
The sausage, I'd never had before. Was not impressed with it. Unlike any sausage I've ever had and not good.
Over all, the experience was very unimpressive. However, it's the first and only time I've been to this location so I have no idea if it is the norm or not, but wouldn't go out of my way to go there again.",2
"My waiter was rude... especially to my guest that arrived late. And our food was simply warm like it had sat out for awhile before arriving to our table. Our waiter also decided to barely fill our coffee cups to the point where a different waiter asked to refill the cup belonging to our late guest before it was even touched.

However, I do love the gift shop and can honestly say that out of the many times I've been to Cracker Barrel, this was my one bad experience.",4
Food was good the service great,5
"I have been twice. Both times were great. Good food and good service. And they have a very lovely store that is quite reasonable. Bought 2 childrens books. I dropped a star because I wanted so bad to come on Thanksgiving, but I am handicapped and they don't take reservations",4
Service always proficient. Food always delicious,4
The food was good my first time there,4
"Last night my cousin and I went to this location at around 10:55p.m. The restaurant closed at 11 but we didn't realize how late it was. I was worried the staff would be irritated about us coming in at the last minute but they were extremely nice. Our server was Jasmine and she was super nice, friendly and pleasent. She assured us not to worry about coming in so late and was very helpful as it was my first time eating there. The food was delicious. My cousin and I both had the fried shrimp with fries. I also had the mac n cheese and fried apples. There was so much food we needed to go boxes. There was another server who's name I forgot. He was from Hawaii and he too was super nice. It was a great first time experience and I will definitely be back. Great food and wonderful customer service!!!",5
"Always a pleasure eating here. Friendly staff, fast service, and clean dining area and restrooms. The food is fantastic and comes in such large portions for the price. You definitely get bang for your buck here. It's worth the 20 minute drive!",5
Delicious just like it is everytime and Jocelin is a excellant waitress we didn't need to ask her to bring anything she knew what we would use and brought it we didn't have to ask her and she was very pleasant I give her 5 stars and employee of the month best waitress ever,5
"I normally never write reviews for any restaurant but the gentlemen who served us made our visit SO INCREDIBLE I just had to write one. Our servers name was Luis, he was such a delightful young man and he was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. We had gone in expecting terrible service due to the high capacity in the building but Luis made our experience feel as if though we were in a 5 star steakhouse like the ones on the strip. Our meal was definitely as he described. He recommended the Chicken Fried Chicken and I was not let down one bit. I will DEFINITELY be coming back and making sure that I ONLY get sat by Luis.",5
Loved it good and cheap first time there and definitely won't be my last,5
"This place is great.  Good food, service and the staff is friendly.  I love shopping in the store looking at all the old fashioned candy and merchandise.  Quality of the merchandise is good.  It's well made and not ""junky"".   I would recommend making a trip there.",5
"What Cracker Barrell isn't bomb.. This location is great! Nice people that will make you smile. Service was terrific this morning, and helped me dial in on catfish and eggs, just what I was craving..  They have a fantastic country store too.  #yummo 👍👍",5
"Over an hour wait. 3x the cost of other buffets. Totally worth it. Best Buffet Ever. Great Quality and variety.

Dim Sum/Chinese, Mexican, mac n cheese, lamb, lobster, crab legs, oysters, shrimp, bone marrow, sushi, poke, cheesecake, gelato, donuts, creme brûlée...are some of my favorites...

Give it a try.",4
Good comfort food at very reasonable prices with good service. No alcoholic drinks.,4
"The service at this location was fine, nothing spectacular, but they don't deserve a one star. The real issue is the food. We had breakfast. Fried eggs were fine, nothing special, but not bad. Biscuits tasted like they came from a mix and had too much baking soda. Grits tasted instant with zero flavoring and not cooked all the way. ""world's best jam"" came from a packet. Sausage and bacon all tasted like they were pre-frozen and the ""smoky"" flavor on the smoked sausage tasted synthetic. Country ham was okay, but not great. Growing up in the south there was never a reason to go to cracker barrel. Now that I've tried it, I'll never be going back.",2
"2 Stars = ""disliked it"". Overall experience was not bad, but I didn't like it.  I went during lunch and had the fried chicken, it was just OK. Mash potatoes, corn, hashbrown casserole was stale and not fresh tasting. Service was good, but slow. He may have been overwhelmed as I had to remind him of a couple requests... Maybe they were off their game on this particular occasion, but this was my first time here and will most likely be the last visit...",2
Always had great food! Great family friendly place!,5
Great location.  Great Staff.  Love the food as always.,5
"Very disappointed, food was very poor quality and taste, service was lacking even though the place was basically empty. Way too overpriced. Will not be returning😣",1
"Same as usual, good and fresh food.",5
"Good food, serving size is perfect. April was our server. Service there is excellent. Chicken fried steak is of course my favorite along with the roast beef platter. Cobblers are very yummy and cant be beat with ice cream mixed in. 70.00 for 4 with drinks. Go, go, go!",5
"The chicken and dumplings at Cracker Barrel are a taste of my childhood when visiting my great Aunt Nellie in Kentucky.  It is my favorite dinner at the Cracker Barrel.  I like shopping in the store.  They have nostalgic toys, candies, clothes, gifts, and more.  You can rest on the front porch in one of the rocking chairs or play a game of checkers.  Cracker Barrel is just a taste of good country cooking and fun.",5
Great service and food.  Dining-in is ok but restricted to limited number so expect up to a 30 minute wait.,5
It’s fun. It’s crowded. The staff are amazing. The food is reasonable and the prices make it very good.  A road trip treat,5
"Food was great,  service fantastic.",5
I don't know if it's the food or the shopping I love more. It's a toss up! Fantastic service. Excellent food. Exciting shopping experience!,5
"We've been to this location twice as we live close by.  But both times our experience was great.  Minimal wait time, yummy food, great price and both times our servers were great.  We have no issues.  And we love walking around the store after we eat.  It is my birthday today, so we are actually going up there this evening for dinner.  I'll try the online check in tonight since I haven't tried that before.",5
"Ordered online breakfast for my family. When my husband went to pick it up, he had to wait past the pick up time (an additional 30-40 minutes) for the order. You would think they would get it right. When he got home he realized he was missing a whole combo and went back. Instead of making it right, your employee accused him of trying to get a free meal! What kind of establishment messed up an order and then accuses a customer of trying to get a $10 meal for free? Absolutely ridiculous! We will be taking our business elsewhere going forward. Zero stars.",1
"The worst!! The are not practicing any social distancing, sanitizing..and the food was horrible!!",1
Julie the server was fantastic,5
Exactly like back home. If you sit with your back to the window you would never know you weren't down south. The food is exactly the same. Good down home cooking with large portions at a very affordable price.  It was only $25 for my self & my boyfriend to do a full 3 course dinner & the food quality is top notch.  The staff is friendly & checks on you often to make sure your drinks are full & that you want for nothing. I highly recommend eating here whenever you get the chance & make sure to bring a little extra cash for the country retail store. You won't be disappointed,5
Food was good as hell definitely will be back,5
Food and service was good,4
"Tasty ""home cooking."" The corn bread seems to be a signature dish. Mine were slightly over done. I ordered the dumplings which were not the fluffy balls I expected,  but more like wide & thick flour noodles that captured the dumpling taste. The large, open room can be a bit noisy if it's full, but the day I treated a friend for lunch, there were only two other tables occupied. Looks to be wheel chair friendly. Some may enjoy browsing the rural or ""farm store"" theme & the souvenir store. This particular store had a ""rocking chair"" sale generally the same design, but various colors and materials for indoor or outdoor use, about $160.",4
"Service was amazing and so was the food, and I bought some good priced items from the shop.",5
Breakfast was awesome Loved it,5
Great service. Food came out in a timely manner and was hot.,5
"We didn't like the service, we had 4 different servers ""helping us"" but any of them did anything right we ended up waiting for our food 50 minutes! Ridiculous!! The food wasn't great, since they open the quality is going down!!.. I remember on the beginning the muffins n biscuits were tasty, soft... n now they're hard as a rock, not flavored at all.. Father's Day breakfast was dissatisfied!!",1
"overall great service and the food was great. I loved the biscuits and gravy, but the maypul syrup is amazing because it's not annoyingly dense and definitely doesn't taste watered down either. It's nice to be able to roam around the shop before you eat because it give you something to do rather than sitting and doing nothing but you can still do that in the rocking chairs outside as well !",5
It was really good and great service too.,5
Wow I talk about an amazing buffet . They have everything one would need for an amazing meal . It was so fresh and filling. A bit pricey but that's what happens when you eat at caSinos,4
"They can make pretty good food when they put their mind to it, but my daughter had extremely runny eggs and we didn't say anything but then when we are bill the cashier asked us if our food was okay and I mentioned it and instead of doing anything about it she told us we should have said something to our server. If she didn't want to know she shouldn't have asked.",4
Good place for breakfast. Fast service.,4
"The food is always top notch here, with very few exceptions.  One of those exceptions today was the grits.  For some reason, they were very runny and watery today, which is unusual.  The rest of my breakfast was top notch.  As it always is, at any Cracker Barrel I've ever visited, no matter the location, the service is professional, friendly and very courteous.  In other words, outstanding!!!",4
"Good service, Good food. Long wait for a table.",3
Food is always great. Employees are super sweet. We always stop in the store to buy something on the way out as well. Love Cracker Barrel!,5
"Worst server ever, he didn't greet us when we arrived. It took him almost 45 minutes to bring out the biscuits and butter. The first round of coffee was cold. He never asked how the food was or apologized for the delay. We asked to speak to the manager and she blamed the delay on a ""technical issue"". I was so dissapointed. I have never been to a cracker barrel that had this level of poor service. The manager was barely apologetic and though she did take 50 percent off the bill, when I went to pay the rang up at full price because it was not discounted correctly. It took 20 minutes just for her to correct the bill (again) and for us to finally leave the store. We were there for almost 3 hours and it only took us 30 minutes to eat. The rest of our time spent there was due to the incompetence of the staff and manager.",1
"The service could have been better, got my food late and server spilled coffee on the table. But food was delicious.",3
Standard Cracker Barrel fare in quiet surroundings. Very reassuring.,4
"I love this place... or at least I used to. I would always have it when heading up to Zion in St. George, but now this location fails to compare. Food is delicious, don't get me wrong, but they skimp the portions and have long wait times. Some servers are amazing, others are meh. I'll still dine here, but I won't be as excited.",3
Nice hometown menu. Staff is very nice,5
Cracker Barrel food was Awesome. The Chairs and Benches are for sale out front.  The gift shop that is connected to the restaurant.  Has the most amazing item's for Sale. Please do your self a favor and go check  it out.  It's Open Normal hours.,5
Good food. Ok portions for the price. It gets very busy here but the servers do their best and are very friendly. I really like the store inside. Lots of neat things dor sale.,5
"Tried dinner here a couple of times, service is horrible and they are always out of food, so we decided to give them one more shot for breakfast. Had the sunrise sampler,  all the meats were overdone and dry. Service was still terrible,  never going back.",1
Country Style food for a decent price.,5
"We were seated right away (not busy at all). Placed our orders got our teas, finished our teas (waited for refills. Did not see our waiter for a while) waited for our food and after 35+ minutes saw the waiter and ask how much longer for our food. He left and never came back before we left. We waited over 40 minute overall. Went to Texas road house and were served right away. We were done with eating, that included a birthday surprise from our waiter within 50 minutes and the food was awesome. Cracker barrel should take some lessions from Texas road house.",1
Good food as usual. Good service as well,4
I went to Cracker Barrel not so long ago and I enjoyed the food excellent food although the cornbread seemed hard I tried buttering up and crumbs decided to fall off like a water fall. I enjoyed the mashed potatoes they are excellent. The only bad thing was the server Luis. I was so uncomfortable with his service. I've been there before and i have never felt so uncomfortable with his presence. Despite that I told him to stop he kept trying to flirt with me. I was uncomfortable with the situation that i just left. I asked for Luis because my friends recommend him as a good server I never expected him to make me and my guests uncomfortable.  I took the food to go except the cornbread. I can tell why its free.,2
"I'm not sure why everyone is so obsessed with this place. Maybe because I'm not a southerner I can't appreciate the food so I reluctantly leave a 3 star, maybe this is how southern food is supposed to taste? That said the staff is super friendly even though they always are busy and the atmosphere is quite nice, they do manage to hit the southern feel I got in St Louis. Prices aren't crazy but in my opinion, the food isn't that good and I've been multiple times. The cornbread one time was over salted and the meat overcooked. Their casseroles are quite tasty and gravy is on par.

TL;DR medium priced southern food that honestly left me wanting more. The novelty is cute though.",3
Good food at a fair price,5
"Came at the right time was seated right away. Food was amazing as always. Hats off to these days time chefs. There was a few broken dishes, and the waitress seemed distracted, but really nice. It was my dad's birthday, thought they would've done something cute. But no. Sorry no birthday treats here.",4
Not big party friendly.  Had a party of 12.  Food was good and prices were decent.  Nothing over $12 for breakfast.  Would have to try the lunch and dinner too.,3
"Excellent customer service, the breakfast is so delicious. I recommend the Grandma sampler has a little bit of everything. Butter milk Pancakes are so good too.",5
Very nice and attentive staff. Food was very good. Everyone including store staff was very friendly and helpful.,4
"Food was super yummy. Service was great. A nice experience. Go online before you go and get on line that way, no waiting at the restaurant. Fun place to shop for gifts as well.",5
Food was awful,1
My first visit to Cracker Barrel and opted for the dinner instead of breakfast. The meatloaf and chicken n dumplings were okay but i would have liked a little more seasoning? All sides were good especially the mashed potatoes. I also tried my partners catfish which was also tasty. The service was excellent and I will go back to try the breakfast.,3
"My wife and I went in to Cracker Barrel on Craig Road in North Las Vegas at about 11:20 a.m. this past Sunday. We went in at that time because they are supposed to start serving their fried chicken at 11:00 a.m.
We placed our orders and the waitress went to process our order. She came back stating that it would be over an hour before the chicken was ready. We pointed out to her that they're supposed to start serving their Fried Chicken at 11 a.m. she went back to verify what she was told, about the chicken not being ready for over an hour. We asked to speak to a manager. We waited for an additional 5 minutes before the manager even came out. He stopped at another table apparently friends of his because they were laughing and seems like he was having a good time. We sat and waited for another 5 minutes while we were watching him talk to these other people. We had asked the waitress to have the manager come over and talk about the chicken issue. Apparently Cracker Barrel is such a large restaurant across the nation that they really don't care about customer service, which is very sad. We would have spent money in their country store had we not been treated so badly by the manager and by the fact that they didn't have the chicken ready that they're supposed to have ready at 11 a.m. this is also supposed to be one of their specials for their 50th anniversary. If they continue to treat people in this manner I don't see them being around for another 50 weeks! We will never go back to Cracker Barrel again because of the way we were treated, and ignored. We will also be relating this unfortunate incident to everyone we know in hopes they avoid any such situation at this location as well.",1
Okay homely environment food okay for the it's very high prices,1
"The fish was cooked perfect
The tarter sauce was my favorite
The truffle fries were good.

Will definitely come here again",4
"I am disabled, we waited outside in the beginning, our named was called, we went inside, and waited and waited, I can't stand for long period of time, told the girl, I was disabled and needed to be seated, she said, if you want you can go back outside and wait. I asked why she called us in if we weren't to be seated.  She called and seated others, and left me and my husband and grandson, disabled also, just standing there.  After a while I asked for a business card, there weren't any. So I walked over to the other side of her and called the store, told them what was happening, at that time we were seated! I was so tired and weak by that time I told them I would file a complaint. This one girl, I won't name online was quite rude. They need better training in dealing with the public. The other people were  nice  and the food was good.",1
Excellent prep and service.,5
"Quaint country store attached to an excellent restaurant. Food is simple, high quality and super good. Good old fashioned comfort food. Never had a bad meal in over 20 visits. Atmosphere is excellent with lots of old antiques to look at.",5
Sara Jean was an awesome server. My dinner was great. The was hot and sexy as served in a timely manner . I will be returning.,5
"Good home style/southern cooking. Nice staff, fast service. Family friendly.",5
Isael was great!,5
Always good.,5
"The atmosphere was pleasant and the wait staff was friendly.  Breakfast was well prepared and presented.  I apologize for my friend's insanity over the her order, she doesn't always take her meds on time. The country store was a heartwarming surprise.  I needed another outlet to purchase western theme gift items for family members, thanks .",4
Good service and the food is good.,4
Food is great.  Website needs tweaking.,4
"Went to the Vegas one, good breakfast. The food portions are not as large as the ones in Georgia, but were equally as good. I always enjoy shopping the boutique section of this restaurant chain, all of the locations have one.",4
"The service was some of the best I've received here in Las Vegas. The place was very tidy, and spacious so I didn't feel as if I was sitting on top of another group. The prices were phenomenal and the food was great, definitely coming back regularly.",5
Excellent Service!,5
"We were pretty much seated right away and in a corner, which was good for our little distracted eater :) There were lots of menu options, so we had to ask our server some recommendations! I forgot the name of my fried chicken dish, but I got it with a side of Mac n cheese. You get a choice of cornbread or biscuits, stick with the biscuits. The cornbread was underwhelming and dry.",5
Great service & food.,5
Great experience love this location had the best waitress very pleased with food and hamburgers are exceptional cooked exactly how I ordered awesome atmosphere love the free cornbread and jams. Chicken fried steak was perfect food is like home cooked meal Also cool gift shop in front with nice gifts.,5
"Friendly,   Great Server, Dakar , Good Eats",4
This is the worst cracker barrel we have ever been too.  They need to review their training program with staff and management. It took three hostess to figure out what tables were clean and open.  the server did not get our order correct. the food took forever to come out. Our biscuits showed up when we were almost done with our meal. No prebussing on any tables.  The cashiers were very friendly and efficient. We will not be coming back,1
Awesome food. So great tasting. And the store is a great plus.. Just bought my new John Wayne book and some more delicious sodas,5
Attentive and friendly staff. Great food. Good prices!,5
Best breakfast of any breakfast restaurant.  Also has great lunch and dinners too! Always fun to shop in the store.,5
Food was excellent. Especially the bacon,5
"Great Service, Clean Restaurant and huge portions. This place is great for people of all ages. The only thing I ask is that the cashier not cut me off when I'm asking a question. May not have been intentional but she seemed pretty stressed out. Love the restaurant and server though!",5
"The chicken and dumplings were delicious the food was warm, the service was good and as always, the price was very reasonable. I highly recommend The Cracker Barrel!",5
"Meets more than expectations...
Our waitress  Destiny was such a wonderful and welcoming and informative person her customer service was over the top outstanding... we are more than likely to go again",5
"Service was amazing. Food was ok, I think it would had been better had they not been so busy. Will try it again!",5
"Was a bit disappointing. They were out of the seasonal special (management... How does this happen?) and won't have it in for several days. Service was subpar at best. I waited 10 -15 min to be greated by server, they never offered to refill my coffee, never came back to check on me whatsoever, only dropped off check....I even had to go get my own carryout container, literally. As I said none came back by, I peeked my head around corner of kitchen to no avail, even calling out for help... Finally grabbed my own carryout container which was in sight. To add insult to injury while waiting to be greeted, there's a meeting going on with a manager a table away from me and after I had to grab my own carryout I observed five or six servers standing around talking with each other on the other side of the restaurant. There's obviously a lack of urgency and efficiency that cascades down from management all the way to the servers. Unfortunately, and needless to say, I wasn't impressed.",3
It was my first time coming here. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about! I love that you can go online and be put on the waiting list. So the wait wasn't long at all!! The server we got was amazing!! She check in on us and made sure we had what we needed ! Very good customer service! When it came to the food it was a hit and miss. The turnip greens were AWFUL!!!!!! Not something I would recommend for anyone to try even if you like them. The mash potatoes and gravy was WONDERFUL!! The mac and cheese was the BEST I've ever had!!! The chicken and dumplings were AMAZING!!! My entree was ok. It don't have the WOW factor. It was the favorite for Saturday so I tried it. I wasn't impressed. In all it was a GREAT experience and I will be back to trying something else.,3
Food has always been great. Service was pretty fast.,4
"As always, Cracker Barrel did not disappoint.  The food is always excellent - one would never expect anything less from this restaurant.  The staff, however, is what puts this location over the top.  The service was stellar, from being greeted at the door with samples of their lattes, to paying the cashier.  Your every need is taken care of, kind of like going home to mom's house for dinner (without having to do the dishes).  Our host, Amos,  made sure we had the seating we requested.  Our server, Javon, made sure EVERYTHING was perfect during our meal. And we have to thank  Brian, the manager, for stopping by our table just to check in on us.  It is this kind of personal service that keeps this family coming back to Cracker Barrel.",5
Love Cracker Barrel! Delicious and great food! I just wish they'd use fireplace more often.,5
"Not a good visit. Location is very busy. The waiter couldn't have cared less if we got served, acted very dis-interested. Manager was frazzled. My carrots were barely cooked, and the hamburger was overdone. Bathrooms needed attention. Even if a restaurant is busy, that is important!!",3
"The quality of the food here is always consistent but we go to this restaurant always be prepared for a very long wait. The staff is always helpful but quite often is seems like their over worked (which is just the industry) but they show it in their attitude, politely. The pricing for most of their food items is decent and I quite often find it as one of my go to spots for lunch especially for the amount of food that you get for the price and the overall quality. This is now spot that she go to if you're in a rush however.",4
Love this restaurant. The service is great the food is good and it is hard to walk out of the store without buying something.⭐,5
"Salad was frozen, chicken fried steak had old French fries stuck on bottom of chicken",2
"Friendly staff, good food. Clever ploy with the retail store in front. My wife spent money...Cracker barrel gets 20% of its revenue from the store. But it's some good stuff. Overall a nice place.",5
Great food great prices just like grandma used to make,5
"The waiter, Kyle, was very sweet and attentive. We had a great time visiting with him. Dinner was pretty good. It wasn't as good as Cracker Barrel used to be, but we enjoyed the ambience and being able to order sweet tea is always a bonus.",4
I cannot begin to tell you how awful this  Place was. There were no so the West settings on any of the tables when we got our drinks we had to wait 5 minutes for spoons to Stir the sugar into our coffee when the silverware did come it all came on one tray so everyone touched my    Silver Ware where before I received it. I was supposed to receive two fish filets with my dinner. I only received one and when the food was brought to the table everybody got the wrong dinners Placed in front of them. The manager came over to ask us how our meal was and we voiced our complaints he blamed it on management and having a new staff. Trust me don't go to this Cracker Barrel I've been to many cracker barrels across the country and they were all consistently good but this one was a nightmare are true comedy of errors.,1
Ate breakfast today.  Great food. What was amazing was the staff. Everyone I encountered was happy and upbeat. Very helpful with big smiles.  They made my day a better one.,5
The wait staff is awesome the food was cold though i will never send food back they just need to work on the food warmness...,3
"Paid full price for 2 Thanksgiving meals to go.  Store RAN OUT OF PUMPKIN PIE BY 1PM  on Thanksgiving day.  No replacement offered, still charged full price.  They didn't bother to mention that they ran out of pie prior to placing my order.  Next year, they'll probably run out of turkey and not tell anyone but will still charge full price.  POOR SERVICE, POOR PLANNING.  Next year, Marie Callenders.  Cracker barrel owes me 2 slices of pie.",1
"Not good,  sad I used to love cracker barrel",2
"Excellent place, Food and Atención 👏👏👏😊",5
"Nothing bad to say about this place but honestly wasn't ""wow'd"" with my experience. Food was good although some of my fries okra was fresh and hot and others were stale and warm. When I made a mistake ordering fried catfish instead of grilled they were very nice about fixing it. My daughter loved her pancakes.  Wish they had a little more selection on hot tea but again not really a big deal.",3
From the clean restaurant to the prompt service to amazing food I get 5 stars all around. Totally reminded me of childhood. And we all very much enjoyed our meal. B maple syrup is so legit,5
wack and the service was also wack,1
Good food and great service! I love the store!,4
"I really enjoy cracker barrel for breakfast. However, this was a slow, disjointed experience as far as food delivery. I'm not sure where the breakdown was- maybe things just weren't being prepared as an order? Toast and other parts of the breakfast came out at least 5, maybe close to 10 minutes later. This is not typical cracker barrel experience at other locations.",3
"This place lives up to its hype. Good food,good people. Would definitely recommend to others.",5
"Extremely disappointed with just about every aspect of my visit to this location. Upon being seated it took at least 5 minutes for the waitress to even greet us and take our drink order. By the time she came around we already knew what to order. The biscuits and cornbread came a few minutes after that. These were served with what looked like toxic sludge which they called apple butter. This did not taste like apple nor have the consistency of butter. The food finally arrived and this is where I was truly disappointed. I can look past mediocre service, maybe the waitress was having a bad day or the manager understaffed them. However, the quality of the food has no excuses. The corn was definitely canned corn, and if they saw otherwise that's just more insulting to them then if they just admitted it was canned. One member of my party ordered breakfast which was served with a literal hockey puck of sausage, slimy bacon, and average pancakes. The other two meals were luke warm at best. When we spoke to management about the issue the best they could do was half off two of the meals. Pathetic. Apparently they just switched billing systems and they struggled to even ring us up. This is clearly a Cracker Barrel Corporate issue. This company is cutting costs everywhere they can from food quality to training, and it shows. I will never patron another Cracker Barrel restaurant again.",1
If you have seen one Cracker Barrel menu you have seen them all but the staff here did a fantastic job. When we arrived it was busy and there was a little bit of a wait but they did a great job taking care of people. Our server was obviously very busy but managed to take care of us just fine and had a fantastic attitude.,5
There is a need for someone to pour coffee and drinks and not just your waiter.  3 waitstaff  walked right past us with our coff cups empty and they just ignored us like we were not there.  Which considering the other cracker barrel that we have been in  that was disappointing.  Our waiter was great and did his great job of serving us.,4
Decided to give this place a second chance . yet another dissappointment ..   I'm not sure if it was because i was the only colored customer .. Nothing changed .. Will not be coming back here again.......Food is ok . went there today. Waited about 30 mins to be seated. Once being seated a girl with a really bad attitude took our order . after taking our order someone else brought it over 20 minutes later ( another employee said he was the general manager whose name is Greg) still missing some sides . all tables were being served and taken care of exept our table. They would just look away and pretend they wouldnt see my friend trying to get their attention. never came back finally over another 15 minutes later another employee came with our sides. No one gave us our checks or even asked if we were ready to pay or we wanted a drink or anything else. We just got up and went over to the front of the store and paid. Horrible experience to be honest,1
"This was my first time at this location. I went today, 5/5/17, and got there around 730-ish am with my mom.
I am totally impressed with how friendly the entire staff is. They really did make the experience homey with morning greetings and chit chat. I travel a lot and have visited many locations around the country. The food is always excellent. But amongst their already great customer service, this location offered  the best experience! I wish i had taken the time to get my waitress's and hostess's name. They were wonderful!!",5
To much in a rush to get you out..noo biscuit and one slice of sour dough was given when egg n bacon was served,3
Always good food. Love the store,4
"Service here is really going down hill.  We've had more than one visit lately  where the wait for the food to be brought out was unacceptable and one instance where we were seated and then sat for 20 minutes before we finally left.  Today my wife and I had dinner here.  The server brought three biscuits.  I asked if we were supposed to have one more and he said they had been ""cracking down on bread lately"" and the serving was to be one for each customer and one for the table.  What does that even mean?  I will not be returning.",2
"I love this place. I always have a great experience. There is a wait but what do you expect it's a great place. People who complain about the wait time are just impatient. The crew do what they can with their limited space. People pay 150 to wait in lines at Disneyland, they can wait 20 minutes. Food tasted great and staff is very helpful and friendly.",5
"Hot Caramel latte was not hot, only 1/2 cup full, breakfast was lukewarm. The new fried chicken crispy recipe is not as good as the original one. The waitress was not very attentive.",2
"We went to breakfast with our 8 mo. Old great grandson, grandson and granddaughter!  The service was excellent and the food was very good!  They were very busy, but made us feel like we were the only customers there!",5
Good  food,5
"Well my grits were t done. They're supposed to be creamy, they were t cooked fully. My gravy for my biscuits was just awful...plain awful. The waitress we had was very very courteous and she was on her game! Sorry cnt recall her name. But every time we come here it feels like it gets worse and worse.",2
The food was awesome large portions service was great.. Gift shop has so much great stuff lots of old school goodies.,5
Hummm.  I love this place.  They have really good food.,5
Food was good and so was the service in the dining room.   But I had to wait a long time to be seated. Then there was no cashier so I just left some money by the register.,2
Food was just awesome. Kristine was great with customer service. Great place to eat.,5
"Best southern breakfast in all of America! Excellent service, great staff, and love the country store in the lobby. The food is delicious... Come hungry!",5
Friendly staff! Food was exactly how and what I ordered when I came to pick it up. I would recommend trying the blueberry pancakes! Yummy,5
Seated immediately. Great wait staff everyone was friendly.,5
One of my favorite places to eat. Always welcoming.,5
"Never been to a bad Cracker Barrel, this one is no exception. Gets very busy. If you're going on Sunday, I'd recommend waiting until around 3pm. But the service was excellent regardless of how busy they were.",5
Nice service coming back soon with my mom,5

"This is probably the closest experience I will have to England in the states. Some of my friends who have been to England said this is by far, the best fish n chips they've had that tastes almost identical to the real thing. The fried fish is so perfectly moist and juicy on the inside and deliciously crispy on the outside. I couldn't get enough of this. My tastebuds were happy and satisfied and I just couldn't get enough of it. The fries were great too, especially paired with the mango curry sauce, tartar sauce, sriracha aioli. Those truffle fries were amazing. Upgrade worth every penny.",4
"Nice restaurant. Staff was nice. However, the food took awhile and was cold. 😫",4
Love the food and atmosphere.,5
Good food not so good service,3
"Not bad for a Sunday Brunch. And joined by my Spiritual Sisters, made it all the more better. About 20 min to wait, but conversation made it pass quickly. We all had breakfast items. One with a slight twist.. fish. Lol Mine included a hash brown casserole. Oh my.. sooo delicious! You can get it loaded, but my selection was a sampler as was.. so no loaded casserole for me. Service was great! Management was out on the floor checking up on the guests. Maybe he didn't need to show so much, but it was all good! A fine meal with fine Friends. Go check it for yourself.. even if going by yourself. It's all in how you handle things!",5
A piece of ham that was the size of turkey bacon for over $6. And that was all I got. The food is overly salted and never tastes that good. go to the omelette house for authentic original delicious breakfast,2
"Not worth the hype. This place has been slammed since it opened. Finally had the time to eat here. Had a long wait to be seated. Longer wait for food and was disappointed once it came. Small portion sizes, mediocre food. Expected something much nicer. Staff was very friendly, country store was pretty cool, restaurant could use some improvement.",3
This restaurant is great I wish there was one near me,5
Great food in service in drinks !!,5
"The fried  chicken was not cooked all the way.  The potatoes and gravy were good, the okra was cold and tough.  I also ordered a Apple Pie the apples were not cooked all the way they were hard and the crust was almost doughy for 9.99 it was horrible. The entire meal was bad the only good thing was the mashed potatoes and gravy had to chuck the rest it was a waste of close to $25.00.  Very disappointed.",1
"Ordered online and paid for my order. Got there in 20 minutes as indicated on the order receipt online. Waited about an additional 30 minutes to get my order. Shame on me for thinking they got the order right. Called to speak to a manager, on hold for 15 minutes no answer. Really shines through your desire to be open for business.",1
James was awesome waiter and food was good too,5
"Had dinner last night, ordered trout dinner and dinner sampler. The portions were very small. The sweet potato casserole was too sweet, the kale salad was good, Seemed like the baked potato was microwaved.
Stick to breakfast at this place!",2
"Spent 2 hours just trying to get breakfast.  The waiter didn't even come check if we needed refills, brought us the check didn't offer dessert,  or boxes.",1
"My only complaint is the wait time, but they have a wait time because it is so great here. Great service, great food, cute gift shop with awesome deals. If you love southern food, eat here.",5
"All I got was bacon and biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were hard, like really hard. The gravy tasted okay. The bacon was okay, but even bad bacon is pretty good. Not the Cracker Barrel experience I've had in other states before they opened in Vegas. I don't think they've expanded well.",3
Same old food as all the other Cracker Barrels.,4
The Catfish was awesome 👌 and so was the macncheesethe Turnup greens as well,5
"Loved it...my first visit love the store and restuarant, and you guys carry LOOK candy which is very hard to find. Thank you love your variety store the most. Great and friendly services. Thank you for your kindness. Peg",5
Delicious food. Server forgot a fork that we requested but I did have a extra spoon I was able to use,4
Great service. Very clean. Knowledgeable staff.  Can't go wrong.,5
"I love Cracker Barrel, their food is always good and they have lunch specials at a great price which is what i had today. They always have daily specials. They are very friendly  and love shopping in the store.",5
Meh. About what you would expect. Food was good and adequate portions.,3
"Excellent pancakes and atmosphere. 2 stars because the wait is insane and they served me extremely undercooked eggs. I was almost drinking the eggs. Not acceptable, especially after waiting a hour and a half between parking and actually having food in front of me. No exaggeration. Also the service was slow and the waitress kept forgetting things. She also gave me the wrong bill at the end.",2
"Yuck worse Biscuts and Gravey I’ve ever had
Had a better batch from a little bar",1
LOVE Cracker Barrel Stores. SO glad they came to Las Vegas.,5
Food is good but very busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings. I suggest calling ahead for reservations and have patience if it takes a long time for drink refills. The food is great though.,4
I love the southern-style food at this restaurant,5
Food good and service good.,5
"A genuine Cracker Barrel that lives up to the reputation. It is in a nicer area where nicer shops are popping up. I get the blueberry pancakes with blackberry toppings, and usually a side of bacon or ham. The seasonal specials are usually the best thing on the menu, and I especially like the apple butter. They have a few healthy choices, but they aren't known for that.",5
"Breakfast was awesome. Our pancakes, eggs, meaty bacon and home made syrup were made exactly the we love it.
Our server provide excellent service and advise. We will be back!",5
"You will never do wrong at cracker barrel. Great food, good prices, great service.",5
Very friendly and fast service😊,5
"Great food, nice staff, painfully slow.",1
Very good food county food,5
"I like Cracker Barrell for the consistency of a breakfast no matter where I am. Like the Uncle Herschel's Catfish.
They have many unique gift and clothing items in the country store. Found a cute pair of dress boots and a vest hoodie for my 2 year old granddaughter.",4
Always good! Friendly staff and the way how everybody its all organized starting with the managers it's very impressive. Nothing compared with the mess you always see at IHOP.,4
"This was our second visit in the last month.  Food is predictably good and maybe the best service in any chain I've been.  The hardest part is always picking what you want...especially if your from the mid Atlantic or south east.  Only complaints are the reflection coming in from cars as they pass by around lunch time.  They lowered the shades but it didn't help if you gave the window. In addition the two tops slides around really easy so your constantly pushing them back and forth between you.

Still a great place to eat if your close or on the holidays",5
Very nice servers especially Jason. So many delicious food options. Nice and cozy decor and atmosphere. Even has a gift shop! 100% recomend to everyone and i its a good family place too.,5
"Went for breakfast trying to cure our soon to be hangovers and was not impressed with the food. It was mediocre. Our waitress on the other hand could not be swayed by us she stayed kind and upbeat,which I'm sure is hard with drunks !!",2
The food is always spectacular at Cracker Barrel.  It was the day after a holiday so it was super busy. We still received great service!,5
"Pretty bad...
Grits are horrible, portions are toddler sized, and the food tastes either too salty or with no season. Really disappointed in this location. I've had good Cracker Barrel before but this one is unfortunately a let down. Food is edible but definitely not good.",1
"The foods was so good, the services was excellent, they were very attentive and nice, they always smile while we ask for something, we will come back again next time we visit vegas ;)",4
Decent breakfast but not enough variety to pick from. Service is slow during our visit which was on a Monday morning so wasn't busy at all. Love the store inside. Probably won't be eating breakfast there again over other options.,3
Food was terrible. The chicken tenders were extremely tiny. I was missing the gravy for my country fried steak and,1
I love this place I've been here only one other time and it was great I loved the event and memory. It was like reliving that moment just a little. They have great food and awesome service.,5
Just go early in the morning.  Otherwise the portions will be smaller.  I went an hour before they close and the food portions where considerably smaller.  Then the time I went in the morning time.,3
Outstanding service. Great food,5
Homestly comfort experience,3
"I have been to Cracker Barrel in different states before, this was my first time to the North Las Vegas location. I had high expectations because Craker Barrel was familiar to me, however this location was the disappointing. I ordered pork chops and eggs that came with some type of rice casserole on the side. When the food came, we all did not receive our food at the same time. I received mine last and the pork chops and rice casserole were dry and cold. My eggs were suppose to be over easy and they were were like cold and rubbery. I sent it back and the manager offered to remake it but I declined since my appetite had now been ruined. The rest of my family said their food was not the greatest but they ate it anyway. The only thing we ordered that was outstanding was the peach tea! Our server was very nice accommodating but as a family we all decided that we would not go back.",1
"Let me start by saying that we have been anticipating going to eat at Cracker barrel, as we have never been to one before. Our wait time was quick, and our server was friendly..but that's where the good ended. $2.59 for a cup of coffee, or any drink for that matter, is pretty steep. We assumed the food portions would be large, but we received very small portions of grits and hash browns, and our biscuits were not fresh or hot, like they had been sitting out for awhile. The food arrived very quickly after ordering, as if it was not cooked to order. I had the sampler, and my gf had French toast and hash browns...the food was not good tasting. We will stick with Lumberjacks and Farmer boys...",2
This was the first time that we went to this Cracker Barrel location in Las Vegas. It was around lunchtime so there was no waiting. Our service was good. The food was good. We probably will go back to this location since it is closer to us now.,4
"Really good food, excellent service even though one of the servers was training. I think the experience was very good.",4
"Never a bad experience!!! However, if you decide on bringing someone who has never been here make sure they know to not act obnoxious and ""like you eating at a McDonald's"". This restaurant in my opinion is awesome, so don't let your load friends ruin it for everyone else!!!",5
"We stopped in for breakfast and we're even ahead of the morning rush. The restaurant was maybe half full.  I counted 2 people waiting tables, 1 seating people and 1 just walking back and forth.  We waited 45 minutes just to place our order.  Then we had to ask twice for water.  My wife's order was both wrong and incomplete.  We didn't address the incorrect item but we did ask for the rest of the order.  It arrived after we had finished our meal.  In fairness the server tried but had no help and quickly became overwhelmed.  Scratch this Cracker Barrel off of our list.  Never had this experience at any of the others we have visited.",3
I absolutely love this place we go quite often. Love the seasonal offerings of teas and deserts it's great.,5
Cracker Barrel is amazing. They always do a great job on the food and it's definitely worth the price.,5
Hot food with great service. Would have been 5 stars if poached eggs weren't over cooked.,4
Very great customer service very friendly people and great shop,5
The chicken pot pie my girlfriend  did not like it,1
Dinning room is open. Food is still great!,5
In my opinion this is the best place to have a nice meal in Vegas. The staff are amazing and so attentive. The food is always delicious and I can't wait to come back next year,4
"Very pricey but is worth it. Make sure to try the Peking duck.  You do have to pre-order when you make your reservations.  The Hot & Sour Xiao Long Bao is a must try.

Update:  I tried the baked crab legs and it is another must try.  Highly recommended",4
Extremely great service.  Great food. First time in for breakfast and i will be back. The fireplace warming the air and the slight crunch of the pancakes bring back memories of having breakfast at my grandmothers.  Great job guys.,5
"Thank you for the great food and fantastic service. It's hard for us truck drivers to get ""REAL"" food",5
Was seated as soon as we walked in staff was very friendly food came out super fast. The pancakes and sausage was awesome. My girlfriend ordered the chicken and dumplings which she said was good as well. Sorry no pic this time,5
"We have enjoyed eating at Cracker Barrel when travelling for years. This was our first poor experience. The food was good as always, our waitress picked the wrong line of work.",2
"Service was outstanding.  The Ruben sandwich is one of The best I have ever had. The chicken pot pie  my wife says was just fantastic. The place folks up quickly at lunch, so go early.",5
Wonderful! Always look forward to going.  This one is a little tricky to find.  It just west of the 93 freeway.   Service was great as well as the food.  All three of us look forward to our next visit.,5
Breakfast was good (I had eggs in the basket). Plenty of food for relatively cheap. Service was good but food took a while. Raspberry lemonade was yummy!,4
Kitchy place to get okay comfort food. Service is the best thing in my opinion. When family comes into town they always want to go here. Easy on/off from the freeway and ample parking.,3
"Always enjoy coming here, never disappointed in the food. We always ask for the Apple butter to go with our biscuits & corn muffins. The store is always fun. We will be back.",5
"The buffet itself deserves 5 stars. I subtracted 1 for having to stand in line for an hour to be seated. There prolly wasn't a way to get around the long line, simply because its a very popular buffet inside of Ceasar Palace hotel but it definitely took away from the experience. Anywho, it is an amazing buffet with a variety of quality food: prime rib, crab legs (chilled and boiled), shrimp, sushi, dim-sum, frog legs and the list goes on and on. I was overwhelmed with joy. U will not be disappointed. The staff were friendly/helpful. I was able to check-in thru Yelp to receive a free alcoholic beverage. Yes! I will be visiting again.",3
"Great time. Great food. Thank you for the memories while in Vegas!!
Be ready to be stuffed!!",4
Love the food.  Love the folks.,5
Very slow service. Food is good but your going to wait. Incomplete order. Really need to work on speed and efficiency.,2
Just like a spitting image of every other cracker barrel. This one had lots of knights and raiders stuff. Great service and great atmosphere. Been there 3 times and it's still awesome,4
"Such a fun place from the puzzle on the dining table to the old country store. You can eat there 3 times a day, 7 days a week for 10 years and never cover every item / combo on the menu. Everyone has their fav. Mine is the chicken fried steak. With three sides? So hard to choose. One of mine is the baked apples. With daily specials & seasonal offerings, you're drawn back again and again.",5
"Great food , pretty good service if you get the right server. Forget about take out that's not their thing. Had to wait 35 minutes after I ordered soup and salad.",4
Love their food. Everything is so yummy! Awesome staff. Go on the website and get on the wait list gets yiou in faster. I love cracker  barrel!!,5
Best Breakfast food by far. The new Raspberry Tea is to die for. I had 6 glasses. Wish the portions were bigger for the price. Love the General Store. Aaaaaaa+++++,5
Great food,5
"Worst cracker barrel I have ever been to.  Got fried catfish and it was BAD!  Cooked in really old grease...tasted horrible. Cole slaw was bad, hardly a trace of brown sugar on my sweet potato...pintos was the highlight of the meal and they were marginal.   Biscuits showed up when we were done eating...avoid",1
Food was burnt and the bread was dry with a chemical taste. But costumer service was nice.,1
All the breakfast meats were cold one over cooker and they forgot part of my order.,4
"Decent food. Nice atmosphere. Value is ok. Good place, but not overly impressed. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but will probably go back sometime.",3
Breakfast was Amazing!,5
Went to eat there with my wife after work. She ordered a fish plate. The fish smelled super fishy. That not a good sign...the taste was also off/bad. So she returned it and ordered a different plate. I didnt want to eat before she got her food so my food was cold by the time they brought out her new dish. I would avoid the fish from Cracker Barrel. Its the 2nd time we've been there and ordered the same dish. Only I got sick after eating the fishy fish.,2
"We had such a nostalgic time. The food was fantastic and the special made latte, creamy and sweet. Our waiter Rowan, and Brandy just wonderful.",5
"Food was good, home style cooking. Atmosphere was also pleasant as I have come to expect from Cracker Barrel’s. Waitress was attentive, however we came at a busy time and service was a little slow.",4
Great food. Great prices.,5
You can never go wrong with Cracker Barrel. I am.just happy there is one on my side of town. Great food and great service.,5
This location seems to be consistently good. Thanksgiving dinner was awesome and a great price.,5
I love the gift shop. There is always such unique things in there.,5
Love that chicken.,5
"the food was pretty ok, it was my first time there. not a fan of the fried apples tho.

Our waiter though Zack(guy with 1 star on his apron) was just amazing, he deserves a promotion or something, he was just great.",4
"Meatloaf dried out thin sliced, looked like left over from previous day.  I ordered combo chicken salad & sweet potato.  Order delivered with no chicken,  manager adjusted bill for meat loaf, however no verbal expression from Manager.  Won't visit this location again.",1
Excellent  lunch and service.,5
Picked up order of honey ham dinner.  Ham was over cooked hard to cut.  & corn muffins we could use for baseballs.  To begin with carried out two drinks reached to hand to hubby & neither lid on tight. All over car seat & his lap.   Finally I ordered two kids meals & disapointed no biscuits.   Oh well if they were as hard as corn muffins I might have broken a tooth,3
Good experience,5
"5/22/19 we saw the fried chicken,  commercial and decided to give it a try, well my chicken was overcooked,  I called to tell manager Cesar,  very rude saying that's the way it is,  my friend ate there, it was not that hard, he refuse to let me come back the next day, It was late and was not coming back out tonight,  plus I waited a long time with too others, for our, they called back their a couple of times, for my order.  For the money I paid, just wanted some better pieces of chicken, not hard. well they still need some help. Learn how to treat customer with respect. So eat in not out. 0",2
Love this place. Great value for the price and amazing service. Always seems packed but I never have an issue getting a seat quickly and service is fast.,5
"The last experiences my family and I have had here did not feel like Cracker Barrel at all.  Having visited many other locations along the East coast, New Mexico, and Arizona, there is usually a consistency in service.  This location seems to be an outlier.  Food is good; however  some servers lack an understanding of policy, how to ring up orders, and how to properly communicate with customers.  The last few visits, we always have to consult a manager to fix our ticket, and the ignorance is getting old.  I am unsure who is at fault here.  Is management not training servers enough?  Are servers not taking training seriously?  A family member has worked for the company before and they see a large gap between this location, and what Cracker Barrel should be.  Without hospitality and warmth, is it truly Cracker Barrel, or just a forgettable Applebees with checkers tables?  I'd really like to see it succeed.",1
Very good food for the price and friendly people,5
Poor service food cold,2
"Didn't enjoy food, as much as usual. Service was terrible  !",3
"Cracker Barrel has a cult following for good reason. This is definitely American comfort food.

Our food was tasty, service was prompt and polite, prices are fair.",5
"This is what you would expect of a down home country restaurant. Food is good, prices are relatively low, portions are decently sized. Quite tasty.",4
"I'm happy to report that they are serving adequate  side portions. There's an upcharge of $1.50 for the sweet potatoes, but they are huge. The oatmeal and coffee  is done right.
We've always had great service here.",4
Good food great service. Our server was amazing. She was given 3 tables at once but we never felt neglected.,5
"Friendly and Just like home cooking. Better than by Silvertons, I think.",5
Food was great and fast,5
Worst French Toast ever! Biscuits were hard!,3
Really good food and service. The store was fun.,4
I love the atmosphere here. It has an old timey feel and the food is unlike anything you can find unless your in a small town. Worth the trip!,5
"Had a nice fried-chicken lunch...
The fried, outer part of the chicken was strange, like, too much flour or something.
Otherwise, a good meal
Great n friendly service.",4
"Good service, good food, parking is plentiful but can be tricky if you're not paying attention.",4
"Came in here at 7:45 AM on a Friday.  Sent raw scrambled eggs back twice.  All of the orders at the table were wrong.  Service was incredibly slow, so we didn't get out of there until 8:50 and were late for work.  I think it mostly to do with that one server, but even after speaking with the manager they didn't really try much harder.  To their credit, they did remove the items from the check.",1
"The best part of our visit was seeing the large sign in the entry about store policy of non-discrimination!!!
I remember the lawsuit settled with the NAACP back in 2004!!!  Amazing that something most people thought was a thing of the past is STILL rearing it's ugly head continues to occur!!!
Not answering the survey question but some how my response leads me to the Fake-in-chief ""president""!!! Large signs prominently posted to show that restaurants have been forced to follow the law of the land!!! Sad!!!",5
Everything we ordered was very fresh. Love when pancakes are so hot butter melts.,5
We're eating at Cracker Barrel before the food has always been excellent but I was a little disappointed with the pot roast this is the first time I've had it I've had pot roast at other restaurants and have always had meat vegetables potatoes all those kinds of things that go with pot roast at Cracker Barrel the pot roast was just two slivers of beef and whatever vegetable or potato I ordered in this particular case I ordered green beans and mashed potatoes and the meat was on top of the mashed potatoes with light brown gravy never had it that way before it was good but still I was a little disappointed that the meat was technically by itself and vegetables had to be ordered on the side don't know if I eat that again but everything else that was about the store and the restaurant was as usual will definitely go back. Just bought order the pot roast again.,3
Server was slow. Kept forgetting.. Blamed slow food arrival  on kitchen? Not sure whos at fault..Looks cool inside with stuff on the walls. Pretty sure we won't be back.,2
Great place. Fast service and great food. The server Tyler was awesome and kind.,5
Ive only been to breakfast but it was good!. Food is made fresh with country style in it👌. Would recommend always,4
Went at a good day and time. Was seated right away. Server very friendly and accommodating. Food pretty good. 1st round of bisquits not too fresh otherwise 5 stars.,4
Food and service was fantastic.,5
My co-workers and I went for lunch - we called ahead to get on the list  for a table - we got right in but that is where the positive experience ended.  We ordered our food the server was not very knowledgeable but she was pleasant.  We waited for over 30 minutes for our food to come out (party of 4) and when it did it was not correct and most if it was cold.  The server blamed the kitchen and the  side salad one of us had came out with chicken on it.  She offered to let us keep it but  the person who ordered wanted what she ordered.  Another one of us ordered a chef salad and the server tried to say that this salad was the chef salad.  No so she took it back and by the time it came out the rest of us were almost done eating our cold food only to discover that it was indeed that same salad with added cheese and eggs.  A chef salad should have ham and turkey not just chicken.  This was my first and last experience with Cracker Barrel.  I will not even suggest it to my family here or anywhere else. I have no choice but to rate you a one star because I cannot post my comments without it.,1
Food was disappointing but the waitstaff was wonderful.,3
We love Cracker Barrel. Friendly service. Delicious food. This location is no exception.,5
"Food on a scale of 1-10, probably a 7. Service is polite​ but often forgetful. I've gone a few times. Better when it's not as busy. Food is worse quality when busy. I think they're breakfast is better than they're lunch & dinner",4
We called ahead for a table but still had to wait for about 15 minutes. Took a long time for the server to come take our orders.  Our order was prepared incorrectly. Had to send part of it back.  We had breakfast and also tried the fried chicken - they were mediocre!,3
Food was good but menu has less items than a few years back!!! Prices are good. Waiters were great!!!!,4
"I love this place.
The food is killer!",5
Nice family atmosphere. Varied menu selections. The country store was fun.,3
Very nice place. Great food and service. Thanks alot.,5
AWESOME,5
The food and service was great,5
"Cracker Barrel never seems to disappoint me. The food is always exactly what I am wanting and I am never let down. Service was great, everyone had a smile on their face and greeted me as I walked past. I have yet to be let down by Cracker Barrel.",4
"Great place. Always a good meal. My gf found a few things she wanted to buy in the store before we were seated, and a nice employee offered to hold them behind the counter for her until after we ate so we wouldn't have to pay for them before our meal.",5
Best country style food,5
Wait staff was lazy. Food was either cold or over cooked but cold. Manager polite. Wont go back.,1
Fun store to wonder through and find things you forgot about from you childhood while you wait for a table.,5
The food and service are both outstanding! The menu is reasonably priced. And the gift shop always has beautiful and original things to choose from.,5
"Used to love the place excellent service but, After leaving a pair of $130 ray bans and having the manager and an employee lie to my face claiming that they saw or revived the glasses. Sad to say won’t be eating at his establishment again.",1
I left here full and happy... Very clean... Awesome staff... Good food... Well worth it,5
Great food. At a good price. Free refills on most drinks. Good atmosphere.,5
"Great foods. Jason provided us with his great service, either even Restaurant was so clouded at Sunday brunch.",5
"The.   Food.   Is.   Good
And.   All.  The.   Employees.   Are.   Very
Nice",5
Breakfast was ok. Hashbrown casserole was the best. All my meats were pretty gross though. The grits were a tad bit undercooked. It was just ok except the hashbrowns were really good. I had never had breakfast there before though so I would try it again and get different things.,3
Food was fast and hot..great price. Great staff. Awesome waiting patio,5
"Good southern food. Great gift shop!  So fun to look around and see all the toys, games and candy.",5
"Ordered to go, no egg on my egg sandwich.  No gravey with my biscuits.  No ranch sides with my daughters chickens tenders.",1
Almost every parking spot was full but we were seated immediately.  The meals come with hot biscuits and cornbread.  Vegetables are outstanding!  Loved it.,4
Food and service was great. Very attentive and came around filling coffee without asking. Greeted with a smile by front desk felt welcomed,5
"The service was good and the food was great. It definitely gives some of the best buffet food a run for it's money. Overall, this is a great All-American food joint at bargain of a price!",5
"It was ok.  The food was nothing special and tasted like they need to change their fryer grease.  I hate how after you eat, you are expected to wait in a long line to pay for your food.  People exiting the restaurant should be able to pay and leave and not have to wait for people that are jammed up in the cramped store.  Waiting for 11 people to get rung out that didn't even come out of the restaurant, I waited on the way in, I waited for my food, my food obviously waited for the server under a heat lamp for some time and was barely warm, then I waited for my wait staff to bring the check, and waited for them to bring the to-go box which they forgot about for another 20 minutes and then, after all that, we have to get in another line to pay...!!! The food isn't worth all that.  Cracker Barrel needs a better system.",1
"Food was good, service was poor. Not enough staff to work the floor.",3
"Love this place. Great service, good food with healthy portions. Great atmosphere and the staff are very pleasant. If the wait staff is busy the mangers will jump in and take care of the costumers.",4
Good food. Good service. First time going there. Rowan was a great host. Thank you so much 😊,5
"Ordered ahead online. Wait time 30 min. That's fine. Went to pick up order and it wasn't ready.  I asked how long it would be and they said they were packing it together. 25 min. Later and they said they were still getting it. I only ordered a kids meal and fish platter. I live 5 min. Down the road. The  fish was ice cold as were the biscuits. My wife couldnt eat the cornbread because it wasnt cooked all the way,and still was doughy. The best part was the tea. We all felt sick after eating it. This was our first time,wont be returning. I wish I could put zero stars. I thought for a platter that costs almost $13 it would taste alot better and have more food.",1
Great place to eat and it has awesome customer service.,5
"Went there for  dinner . Server did nit listen to my order. I told her pit roast no carrots. I ordered greens instead. I get my order there are carrots! The young man delivers the order not the server and say I will get your greens he does the waiter comes by ""how is everything""? I ordered turup greens. Meanwhile The young man brings me the greens. She cones back with more. She leaves them. The table. Is small and now we have no room.",2
Good food and great prices! Could've been 5 stars but something is always wrong with my To-go order. :-I,4
Cracker Barrel North Craig and  I-15 is a great place to received good country eating friendly atmosphere!!!,5
Always good. Always enjoyable. Food could always be alittle hotter when served...Joe & Peggee Marcano,5
Straight up Delicious! Pancakes were Hot and service was Friendly!,5
"family friendly vibe, simple food for everyone",5
"I love this place , food is good and cheap. Hell I'm not over 75 either lol",5
I always like coming here. I've never had a problem and my most recent visit I had some of the best customer service so far. They really treated us well and got us seated almost immediately despite the busyness on the floor. Will continue to come here when I get the chance.,5
"Such friendly staff! Food was amazing and flavor was out of this world. This is now my go to place for a good meal. Many thanks to Sarah our server who was just so kind, patient, and attentive to our needs.",5
Outstanding blueberry pancakes... reasonable price. Service was great staff is friendly.. you can't go to cracker barrel without browsing the gift shop...,5
Turkey was overcooked tough to eat. And tasted like it sat under a heat lamp .. redipped and sat under the heat lamp some more. Wife only ate half of her meal because the chicken was pretty much the same.,2
"My first time here and looked like it was busy but didn't have to wait to be seated. The waitress was friendly  and menu looked great. When I received my food, the portion was little and my french toast didn't seem to taste like what it was described. The food was not better than IHOP, but will give it another try.",3
I was a bit disappointed. We hadn't been there in a couple years. The portions are MUCH smaller and the biscuits were dry and somewhat stale. Everything else was fine.,2
Great👍,5
"We were seated and served promptly. This was our first visit to a Cracker Barrell, and we were pleasantly surprised by the value we saw on the menu. My son and I were well pleased with our meals. My wife's chicken and dumplings wasn't quite what she was used to, be she said it was still tasty. We are adding Cracker Barrel to our list of restaurants that we will visit again.",4
Americas food!!! Rebecca is a great waitress..,5
Always good...,5
The food was just ok. Fried chicken is way too salty. Portions were minimal.,3
My 1st time to this place and wasnt impressed by the food at all....ordered the bone in fried chicken my sides were steamed brocolli and stuffing but they bring my dinner and its at that time waiter tells me no stuffing available so i need to pick another side. The chicken was dry the outside was hard. The cornbread muffins were dry not sweet. Not a place i will revisit.,2
Never had a bad meal at Cracker Barrel.  Ordered the chicken fried steak today it it was good as usual.,5
"The staff especially Jordan our server was awesome. Store, restaurant, restroom we're all very clean. The country fried chicken, roast beef both very tender!  Mac n cheese, fried okra, broccoli, hashbrow casserole nice portion & yummy not to salty. The biscuits, corn muffins warm with butter honey or cracker barrel syrup. My great nephew celebrating 13th b-day had the double chocolate fudge coco cola cake with vanilla ice cream four of us ate two spoonfuls great moist very rich in flavor. When my mom had the vanilla ice cream bread pudding with pecans she wished she would have had  it first. Mom said she would have had another & taken her dinner home for next day it was soooooo moist & delicious. Thank you for such a wonderful experience it was worth the money spent. I love all of the history on the wall to make for fun memories and conversations. I could go on with more great things to say. Last but not least we'll be back soon. The pancakes look so delicious blueberry I must have some. Continued blessings to this location and your staff.",5
"I love cracker barrel! It's the best, I love all the fun stuff in the store!",5
This location has absolutely terrible service and it’s rare that the food is actually good. I go about once every six months thinking that maybe it’s improved and I’m disappointed every time.,2
I love this place ❤,5
Amazing love the service and the bacon,5
Love how the pancakes taste wow and the hashbrowns wow for got to take a picture but best service ever,5
"As a first customer, the waitress was very friendly and attentive. But my food was cold. I didn't enjoy anything but the ice tea. I don't eat cold breakfast.",3
"Cracker Barrel is a classic. Whenever you want a great wholesome meal at reasonable prices with a smile, eat here. The quality is always high and after only a few times, I had servers remembering my order.",5
I've had a couple bad experiences here. Today I waited forever for my fried chicken. I was seriously about to walk out but it came out right when I got up. Turns out the first batch of chicken was overcooked so they took care of the bill.. Thank you today you redeemed yourself Cracker Barrel 🙏🤙😎,5
Great food great service.,4
"Went with the family.  Had a 20 minute wait to be seated,  and the service didn't get better from there. Had food several minutes before they brought silverware. Every item we ordered was bland. Disappointing.",3
Very Good,5
The waiting list online works well...,5
"This restaurant is close to freeway, restaurant clean, employees friendly and cordial. Food was good although the soup of the day was a little iffy, clam chowder and vegetable beef. Also a outstanding gift idea and items at or near cash register area.",4
"The food quality was terrible. Waitress and Manager were both treating me and my friend like children. Little did he know that we were both Chefs for over 20yrs each!  Pic below is of their ribeye steak. Silver Skin and Fat to the left and ""steak"" to the right. These are my personal opinions and facts about my trip to Cracker Barrel.",1
"I love Cracker Barrel! I have heard many great thing about its service and employees which were proven to be true during my first interview with them! They are very easy people to work with, very kind and supporting to everyone. I can't wait to start working there!",5
"I didn't know what to expect, and I was very pleased. Good food and good service",5
As good as we expect from Cracker Barrel food.  What was exceptional was the service we recieved from Zachary. His service was what i would expect in a 3 star restaurant.  This young man knows a thing or two about customer service.,5
"The food was bad
But they have a cool store 😊",2
"Stopped here with my parents to eat and I have to admit that the food was good and that the prices were reasonable, I just think the Cracker Barrel is way overrated. I also think that the store is priced at rip-off prices. service at the table could have been a little better too... like I shouldn't have to ask three times to have a drink refill, and if you seat four people at a table, then you should get four sets of silver...  just saying, something should be the obvious",3
"CB in general has declined in food quality over the years. The food now tastes like it's from a microwave meal box, and portion sizes match. Service is still great but food is meh",2
"I've  noticed that on the weekends the food seems to be precooked, because the eggs and burger patties were very dry. in addition the burger patties weren't cooked in the garlic butter, they put it on after the patties were cooked.",2
They got rid of white bread. Wth,2
Apple butter on country style biscuits  are delicious. The loaded hashbrowns casserole is also one of my favorites . Rocking chairs to enjoy while waiting.  BlackBerry cobbler is a great desert !,4
"Good price, but the food is pretty greasy.",4
Good southern food. Friendly service. Great atmosphere.,5
Amazing day to shop at this amazing place.,5
"Its Cracker Barrel, never a bad experience.",5
"Great service at this Cracker barrel. They were extremely busy but they handled the large volume like champions, I was very impressed with the quick service and freindly staff. Our waiter Zachary did a wonderful job!",5
Omg!! The Buttermilk Pie is phenomenal. Would share a picture but I ate it all. I added a few slices of banana and loved every bite!!,5
Omg it was Delicious,5
"Food was excellent,  customer service and dining in was better than my expectation",5
Always dependable for good food.  Very nice server Isael. Prices are reasonable for the portions of food. And going through the gift shop is always fun afterwards!,5
"We order online and pick up since the Craig and l-15 location is always so busy.  This hasn't worked out so well though. Always have to wait for the order even when coming in after the time they say it will be ready.  Last time gave us the wrong order so then had to wait for the cooking of our order. Kind of defeats the purpose of online ordering. Food is okay, nothing special and for me under seasoned.  They seem to be understaffed.  Think we're done with Cracker Barrel.",3
Service was great and server was very nice.  I just prefer ma and pops eateries. Biscuit were hard which I prefer softer busicuits.,3
"We had the worse service here this evening. Our food came out before our drinks, service was bad and when I spoke to the manager his response was “I will talk to the server and I hope to see you guys again” I was not fishing to get out of our bill (pretty sure that’s what the manager thought) but we didn’t even get to enjoy our food. I got up, paid and left. I will not ever go back to this place and I’m outraged that we weren’t even offered anything. The least he could have done was actually engage with us, instead of just stating he will talk to her and walking away. He totally disregarded the way we were treated. The fact that he told us he will just have a talk with her and walked away proved to me that he did not take me serious. You lost a customer and you should be ashamed at how you treated my family today!",1
Great food great environment  I loved It definitely going to be regular place,5
Fun but busy,5
The steak was the best part of the meal. Rest of the breakfast was ok. Service was great.,4
"The food was ok, pancakes can't be beat though! The salted ham was pretty tasty too. Some rude people there though, watch out for those who pay no heed to others in the little store.",4
"Nope just nope. The quality of the food isn’t what it used to be 4 years ago back East and they opened this one trying to capture the success of the franchise and failed. I would NOT waste one cent in this restaurant now. If you do, your gut will NOT thank you.",1
"Stuff happens, we know this, especially these days. Cesar the manager has no customer service skills. He laughin my face when I told him it was unacceptable that food was not ready 2 hours after it was supposed to be. He was very unprofessional.",1
"Food was great. Really angry with the service! We ordered our children's food first thing so they wouldn't become impatient. 15min later we ordered our food, and the waiter still decided to bring everything out TOGETHER 40 min later. Our kids as we expected became irritated and fussy during the wait so we had to take them out of the restaurant too avoid irritating other customers. Had the waiter brought the food out when it was ready we could have avoided such a stressful meal. We ended up having to feed our kids while trying to scarf down our food as fast as possible to avoid being there any longer.",2
Breakfast is always good however I enjoy the fish fry fridays more. They give 4 large pieces of cod with your choice of sides. I am not a fish lover but this is a mild always hot and flaky white fish.,5
Great price really good food. Clean great staff had the trout no complaints will go back,5
"Food is not so great, but they have great soap and rooster stuff!",3
Service was not so good and the quality of the food poor. Normally both are really good but not this visit.,2
My food was cold this time the service was great and that store is awesome,4
The Waiter and bus boys work together to make my experience here great!,5
"Always a quality experience.  I enjoy Craker Barrels throughout the U.S., and our North Las Vegas location is an enjoyable place",5
Love the country feel.  Good  comfort food. Good service.  Wonderful place for families.,5
Loved the food and the service,5
WE had a great time. Fast. Great food. Nice pleasant people. I rate them 5*****   bravo. To cracker barrel. And yes I highly recommend them.  Much love. RDP,5
"Got in and got out. It was pretty good but when I told my waiter that it was my birthday, he just said Ok. I don't know if Cracker Barrel does stuff for birthdays, but this one didn't and I was a little disappointed.",3
Nice cozy place with great people and good food.,4
Always love going to Cracker Barrel. Had the ribeye steak. It was perfectly cooked and delicious. The atmosphere is warm and staff very friendly.,5
Yummy.  Love the food and their store.  Bought several things at reasonable prices.,5
"My wife,kids and myself had a great first experience. Our server was great checking on us making sure we all satisfied.",5
Great food. Fast service and friendly staff. Very cool little store with lots of different country items.,5
Omg. The food was great and so was the service.,5
"The only reason this restaurant isn't getting a 5 is because they got rid of the best menu item: I think it was called buttermilk oven fried chicken, but I'm not sure. It was chicken breast coated with cornflakes and baked in the oven. It was a healthy menu option, but I got it EVERY TIME I went there because it was crunchy, juicy, and absolutely DELICIOUS. But now it's gone. I had their new French Dip, and it was good, but the bread to meat ratio was a bit off. Needed a little more meat, or a little of the bread needed to be hollowed out. This sandwich had sliced prime rib, horseradish sauce, and grilled onions. The grilled onions were were tasty, and I don't usually like them grilled. The only other downside was that it really fell apart; I had to use two hands to hold it together while I dipped it in the au jus. Their hash brown casserole is amazing.
Good restaurant with good service, but they really need to bring that chicken back!",3
The service by our lovely server Deja was great... and the food was wonderful... our eggs over medium we're done just right. We'd go back!,5
First time being there and the hosts were amazing. Suggested some amazing choices from the menu! Tell you if I could I would javelin ordered a little of EVERYTHING! I will definitely be going back!,5
"Meh. Much better catfish, mac n cheese and cornbread at Ella Em's soul food not one mile away on Craig Rd. Customer service here is not great either. I have no idea why the wait is so long some days. To say it is mediocre is being generous.",1
"Great meal. Love C B'S Meatloaf & mash potatoes.  Of course, their sweet tea is perfect . Great service too!",5
"Great place for brunch, got in before lunch rush but service was little slow.  Staff was great and courteous but was a little disappointed in the buttermilk biscuits which were hard and dry. Place really gets busy for lunch but still really good servic.",4
Food is not as great as people say an the portions are small,3
"Delicious country style food. Being from Texas, it reminds me of home cooking. Portions are big and prices are cheap. Perfect combination!",5
"Come inside and get a slop of dumplings with no chicken. You can also get 2 burnt biscuits served with ice cold gravy and you can have it all for just $10.99.. If that doesn't make your mouths water, try their overcooked eggs and hashbrown casserole with tiny human hairs. That sounds yummy right? WRONG !! If I were you guys I wouldn't eat or waste money at this location. The gift store is pretty nice..Stop eating at the Cracker Barrel... So Gross and disgusting. Steaks are expensive, but the comments and opinions from the staff get vulnerablly aggravating. It's my money, I buy and eat what I want so mind your own business. I wouldn't waste money on the food here anyway because the portions are small and they feed you like your in the 1st grade. Stop wasting your hard earned money and go someplace else.",1
"Meh. Been to many Cracker Barrels and the server didn't understand what ""select any two"" actually meant. Food came out randomly and didn't have the zest we usually taste. Sale items in the store were only 60% off when everywhere else has it marked down to 70% off. Hardworking hostess...friendly.",3
The Country Boy breakfast kept my belly and wallet filled.  Great family setting.,5
We finally got to try out the new one in town and were pleasantly surprised. If you know the chain it is all the same. The only real negative I have for it is the dining area isn't partitioned off like others so it gets a bit loud.,4
"delicious comfort food.  so far everything tastes great. the wait can be long, but you can reserve online.  the general store is interesting, and they have throw back toys.",5
"Love Cracker Barrel, especially when it isn't crowded. We ate breakfast this time and it was prepared nicely. Biscuits were a little dry but add a little butter and one of the assorted jellies you are good to go.",5
"I wish I could give less of a rating but I feel that the food was adequate and the busyness of the restaurant was understandable but every time I have come here the experience has been less than desirable.

My father-in-law wanted to attend on Father's Day so I felt obligated to go to Cracker Barrel my last experience was not very good the food took a long time to get there the prices were a lot more expensive than I felt the food and service dealt warranted.

Half of the table got their food first they ordered lunch and dinner Combos and 4 my wife and our two boys we ordered the breakfast menu as we favor breakfast.
My family was the only ones at the table not eating everybody felt awkward that we were sitting and waiting for such a long time for our food it was over 40 minutes when they finally delivered the food!

My brother-in-law complain to the manager and I was over hearing the conversation, the manager was Shifting the blame and not taking ownership of this situation.

I have worked Hospitality almost my whole life in one facet or another there was no Hospitality at this restaurant the manager was unrelatable at best the food was mediocre the prices were high only the servers I would rate favorable.

Happy Father's Day to me! I should have just gone to McDonald's I would have gotten the same food quality at about 1/4 of the price!",3
Waited too long past what we were told so we left,1
Great food exceptional service.  WY better than the other one in Las Vegas,5
"Stopped in for breakfast before a 1600 mile roadtrip. Less than 20% capacity in the dining area. My wife and I ordered promptly with good service with the exception of the hour wait with no food.

The kitchen failed this establishment today.

We are regulars here and this was by far the worst service at this CB. For that fact any of the Cracker Barrel's we've been to in the lower 48.

Upnote is that I got to walk 1 mile, round trip, with my wife from where we could park the tractor.

This place has become hit or miss. Today was a miss.",1
Delicious food great staff recommend it and will deffinatly return,5
An inexpensive way to eat for a trucker,5
Food is always fabulous.,5
"Great food, great service and reasonable prices.",4
"Always good food, always good atmosphere",5
I love Cracker Barrel and their food.  My favorite is the cheddar broccoli chicken and the hashbrown casserole.   The shop always has great things from candy to clothing.,5
Loved it omg  good all American food,5
"Food is good but the service has been bad everytime I have come to this location. Half the sides did not come out with our food, we had to ask for it. As soon as we started eating the waitress brought out our check and said if we needed anything else to let her know. We never got a refill on drinks because we never saw her again. So this will be our last visit.",2
Excellent service good food. Amazing mac-n-cheese. There was a bit of a wait for the food to arrive. But overall worth it,5
Always heard about this place now i know it true. Great food at reasonable prices. Service was spot on! If there was one close to me i'd be there!!!,5
"My Husband enjoys going yo Cracker barrel, but I can take it or leave it. It seems like we always get the Waitress from hell. And I like my food hot, (heat) and I have yet, to get my food hot.",4
"Food was ok, our waitress was sweet and attentive. I was a little disturbed that most of our plates had been broken pieces missing from it. I took pictures but doesnt really show up cause its white.",4
Ridiculously slow....👎🏼 left and decided to go somewhere else.,1
Fast service. Knowledgeable staff.  Laquan is an excellent waiter. Very friendly. Deserves 5 stars just for his fantastic service,5
my food was unfortunately undercooked. it was immediately replaced with a perfect chicken fried chicken steak. my meal was comped!  such integrity!,5
"Pretty busy location, food was good. The our waitress was great the other staff members seemed to be too busy talking amongst themselves while you have to stand in line to pay after eating.",3
"Awesome, as usual",5
"Their 50th Anniversary Southern Fried Chicken was terrific! As promised, it was tender, crispy, moist, and a good portion size.",4
Food was really good.  Waiter was friendly.  We. Had fish and chips. And the grilled haddock. Yum.,4
Excellent food! Fun store and good service.,5
Most amazing place to go for breakfast! Ask for Ashley. She is amazing!,5
First time I was there.  Food very good but I thought the portions were going to be bigger.  Maybe it was the sandwich that I ordered.  The gift shop had a lot of interesting things in it.,5
Pocket friendly. Great food and was serve lightning fast. Waitresses were very attentive and friendly.,5
Worst customer service eveeerrrrrrrr! Do not recomend,2
Good food!! Affordable,5
Ate a late lunch early dinner here today. Plenty of food for what you pay for. Very nice waitress  named Roseanna made sure all was good with us. We will go back again,5
I love this place we don't have one near me so when the chance arises I stop for the GREAT FOOD and friendly staff.,5
"Food was good, service needs some work. Server had a hot plate, rather then doing the logical thing and using a towel or otherwise to keep from burning thier hand, they ran out with it to the table and literally threw it on the table! Not the best idea! Anyhow no food complaints, and since it is a new open, sure the staff will learn little things eventually (or release those that can't). Online reservation system worked, physically waited 5 min when the walk in wait was over 30 min.",4
Best pecan pancakes with fried apples in town. Alejandra was our waitress and took very good care of our table.,5
"Great service friendly server good food, easy access location to the freeway",5
This place is so good. Home cooked styled food. Great value and huge portions.,5
Excellent service and a great and welcoming environment. The food is great!,5
It was alright hashbrowns almost broke my tooth and service wasn't that gre but i belive the server was new so it was ok,3
"I never been here before, we came for breakfast. The service was great but the food took 45min to come out. I ordered an olmet with NO meat and when it was served it had ham and little to no vegis was a little disappointed. Also the warm apples were gross.",1
"Very busy, waited to be seated. The food was horrible. The coffee was cold. The food was served quickly. Our server was great and courteous.",3
My family went there for dinner at 5:30pm today. We were taken to a dirty table and stood there while the table and chairs were cleaned off. We ordered drinks and dinner but didn't receive our drinks until half way through our salads and biscuits. The baked potato was warmed up in the microwave and tasted watery and bland. Hopefully this was just a one off!,3
Food was good but small portions. Server was very nice and friendly. Love their little store!,4
"I love almost all the flavors that you can find here, but I really would appreciate if they take a look at the services of some members of the team.",4
Very noisy while dining.  Hard to have a conversation. Needs better acoustics.,3
"Fair. We been to other ones and felt that this one was not connected with the rest of them , food fair ,service almost fair and parking was terrible",2
Cheesey Grits is not cream of wheat with shreds of cheese on top. Asking me and husband if we want more tea when we said Not Yet 3 minutes ago over and over was annoying. Then asking me if I want the check while I am eating & you did not even talk about desserts available was rude. The one in Arizona served green beans from a can. I came anyways thinking Las Vegas will be better. I was wrong. I am ashamed you did not do grits the right way. Not coming back.,2
"Very good food, excellent service!! Also the shop had the cutest things, will definitely recommend!!!",5
"My first time here.  The wait was long, but the food was very good. I ate off the healthy menu which was delicious! Lots of side choices which helped to keep the calories down.",4
The food was delicious as usual! Service was a little slow. Otherwise pretty good experience! ☺👍,4
"Not much to say. Food is great, place is clean. Unbeatable customer service. Not much variety and flavors but what they do offer is tasty.",5
"Worst food ever. I've eaten Cracker Barrel many times with no issues. Eggs were cold, biscuits hard, bacon dry and over done.  Gravy and grits no flavor. Apple butter tasted like nothing. Hash brown casserole was cold as well. The only good was the iced tea.",1
Atmosphere was great but I come from a southern background and my cooking is better. Next time I'll try the breakfast menu because the dinner chicken and catfish was not to my liking,3
"Not your old fashioned CB. This is the new layout, much lighter and brighter. I've been a CB fan since the 1980s with thousands of visits logged on the east coast. I was a weekly visitor when they opened a Watertown, NY location up at Ft. Drum! However, this visit was full of problems - a 20 minute wait to see my waitress after being seated, crunchy biscuits for my gravy, cold food on the rest of the plate, a LONG wait for my to go box after eating, even though I ordered that from the wonderful waitress that brought out my food. Then when I was ready to leave, my waitress further delayed me by losing my check. I work less than 3 miles from this location. NOT a good first visit to my local CB. I LOVE CB, so I will go again, but it's doubtful I would go back to this one. 😐",1
It was kinda cold the biscuits were a little undercooked the customer service was really good though otherwise great portions of almond pancakes...prices were reasonable...,4
The service was great. The.food was fantastic.  Never had such tasty chicken before it was worth every penny.,5
Had to send the steaks back thay moo when we cut them but a great friendly staff they redid our plates and made it perfect,4
"First time, great menu had the chicken liver with onion gravy. Very good for those liver eater, ""Try it"". Ask them to smother it in the onion gravy, if you like that way",5
"The food is very good. The service has been excellent except for a very disappointing carry-out attempt on December 22, 2017. When no one came to take my order, I went to be seated. I waited at the table for 10 minutes, never acknowledged, not even to get a drink order. I finally left after 25 minutes total of non-service. Lunch time, 11 tables empty, it was not full. I did go back on Saturday, December 23rd, 2017 and informed them of the non-service the day before.",4
Good fast service,4
Excellent food and service,5
"Great food, really nice employee. Wonderful items in gift shop!",5
This food was horrible we have eaten at many Cracker  Barrels in our day but this one is really bad my fish was not done the biscuits were also not done my French fries were old warmed over fries who knows from when! It was just horrible don’t waste your money!,1
"Such good food! First time visit, amazing service, we received our food within 8 minutes of ordering. Our drinks we're refilled the moment it went down to half full. We received our bill before we finished our food which was nice because I hate asking for the bill- and we had plans immediately following.",5
"Food was eatable. Best to stick with CB's specialties, like chicken fried steak or fried anything.",2
"Food is nice, gift shop is much better, go smell the candles",4
Gr8geo2 loves this attention and attitude to detail to preparation of a great quintessential American food.,5
Food was cold. Waitress was non attendant. First and last time I will go there. Yuk,1
Best coffee,5
"Great, pretty authentic southern style food. I'm so glad we finally have one in town!",5
Very good service. Extremely good food. And hot!!!,5
Really good food and cute store attached. Very friendly staff,4
Huge portions!!! But a bit bland. Their sweet tea is really good though.,5
"Great food. I ordered Chicken Fried Chicken. Sides Mac & Cheese, fried Okra,  and Pinto Beans",5
I had a to go order and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes; I waited 57 minutes after asking 3 times how much longer.,2
The was a hair in my chicken and dumplings. Even though the manager replaced it with a fresh plate there was no offer to take it off the bill....any other restaurant would have and not one offer of any sort of discount. Service was okay but the staff was very nice and attentive...,3
What a bunch of ladies from church we have the best luncheon at Cracker Barrel customer service and the food was excellent,5
Fabulous giftshop!,5
You can never go wrong when you stop at Cracker Barrel to eat.  Best southern cooking on the road.,5
This was the worst Cracker Barrel I have ever visited. Took an hour to get served and the food was horrible.,2
"First time at Cracker Barrel, the food was amazing, the server was not that great but he was pretty busy. The food and atmosphere is definitely worth going for.",5
I love their food.  Great waitress.  Place was a little dirty though,4
Excellent service and great southern cooking.,5
"Clean, friendly and fast service.",5
"When the restaurant first opened up, my wife and I only stopped there for breakfast which was delicious! However, we got a rare opportunity to stop and eat there for dinner and the raspberry lemonade should be renamed to raspberry lemon crack! It was so delicious! This restaurant does not fail to please.",5
I loved this place breakfast is the bomb here... And the cold part about it is that you go inside the Cracker Barrel you walk through like a little store has the coolest stuff in there well the one I went to did...,5
Love the food here. Love the service! Cozy. Good eating!,5
Great breakfast/lunch spot but just know there will be a long line sometimes especially Sundays.,5
Try the blackened catfish. They also have the best chicken fried steak.,5
"Again, another wonderful meal at Cracker Barrel. I just wish they would serve the silverware with a napkin vs the little bag.  Thanks again,  Happy Holidays To All!",5
"It's not fine dining, but come on... breakfast at CB? Mmm mmm good! There's always a short wait,  but since it's just me or one other, not too bad. All the waitstaff has been friendly and attentive. I hate the parking lot - who plans the flow of those things!? - but when I'm craving comfort food, this CB meets the need.",4
"Nice, quiet, and a very friendly environment.
Food was great not much of southern eater but recommend it if you are!!
Their store is awesome!!",4
Service was spectacular but the food was not. Our order was wrong. The biscuits weren't done and my bacon was overdone. I'm going to blame it on how busy they were at the time so I'll be sure to try it again when the parking lot isn't full.,3
So yummy! I love the fried catfish and hashbrown casserole!!! The staff was extremely nice and such cute stuff in the country store. I am so happy that the first Cracker Barrel in California in here in Victorville! Thank you for the VIP dinner and delicious breakfast at the ribbon cutting! Welcome to the High Desert!,5
Excellent service had to have  mask to get in,5
The service was not great. But the food was good for the price.,3
"The food was the quality expected from the chain, which is good. But it took over 30 mins to get to the table and was prepared incorrectly which led to an additional wait.
The server checked in often but did not deliever common requests in a timely manner. My ""never empty"" coffee was empty, pancake syrup took several mins and a request for box (due to late arrival of food) also took several mins.

All that said, the food was delicious so I may return for that alone. Deff not the best CB experience, maybe the South just does it better 🤷",3
"My mom and I had went to CB for our first time not too long ago and we were excited to see what the fuss was about. Not TOO long of a wait time but it wasn't even that busy. It took 45 minutes for the food to come! They gave my mom the wrong plate so we asked for the correct one, my eggs were cold and rubbery, and so was my potatoes. The only thing that was semi hot was my pancakes. Their customer service was not too good, Yes there are some outstanding staff with great customer service, but our visit we got the bad ones. Lady gave us attitude when we asked to change the wrong plate, and she didn't check up on us not once. Overall our CB experince was awful to be honest, i was expecting more from this place.",2
"Excellent food and service. Very nice ""country store""    good value.   Excellwnt for families of all sizes.",5
"The food here was wonderful, the prices were great and everybody there was a really nice. And the gift store is really cool.",5
"I ordered from door dash and my food was horrible. My chicken and dumplins had no chicken, my Mac and cheese had no flavor,my catfish had no flavor,my suppose to be crispy juicy fried chicken was very dry, my greens was very good but my portion was very small as if it was the last bit left. Very dissapointed",1
I hear the cracker barrel is great in the south we ate at a north Las Vegas store not impressed with the quality or quantity of the food,1
The food was delicious all around from the fried chicken to the corn muffins. wait time wasn't too long shorter than quoted by hostess. the general store is a fun way to spend your wait time. Only negative is the dinning area could be larger. Restrooms were clean.,4
I'm happy to have cracker barrel in Las Vegas because we only had it on road trips before. I enjoy browsing through the shop part while waiting for a table. Its very Americana in there and the food is too.,4
First time great food and service,5
"We went last evening,ordered the country fried tukey,was informed they did not have any more turkey gravy but could have brown or white gravy. Things do happen so let that One go. For drinks I asked for hot tea,the waiter returned to the table to inform me that they were out of hot tea unless I wanted decaf, soo I just went with  coffee and water with lemon. While waiting for our meal he brought biscuits and cornbread out.You could not break or cut the biscuit apart it was so hard .I dropped it on the plate and am surprised it didn't break the plate. We got his attention and the first thing he said was ""are those to hard for you""  I do not blame him for the hard biscuits but I do find fault with him for serving something he knew was not good.When our meals were brought to us the plating was horrible! Did not look appetizing at all! The mac and cheese my husband had looked like it was at least three days old. The mashed potatoes had no seasoning and there were exactly 4 small slices of apples served for the fried apples. The Turkey tasted a bit like it had freezer burn just an odd taste.the only time we were asked for refills on coffee and my husbands drink was when we were presented with the check.never did get that lemon for my water and the food and service was really bad . Its unfortunate because the last time we got the same dinner there it was perfect and the taste was awesome. Just don't think will try again on a Wednesday  and hope the cook and waiter do not work to many days a week .If anything happens like this again, we will probably just go down the road to the Texas Road House and see how they do things",2
Always a little piece of our hometown Pennsylvania when we walk thru the doors or Cracker Barrel! Food was delicious and hot. Service was great and our favorite part is the store with all the goodies from our childhood.,4
The food the atmosphere were awesome!! Loved shopping in the gift shop!,5
"No chicken in my dumpings, disappointed today, i had been looking forward to eating here. Dean Martin location is way better. My 1st time to visit the restaurant on Craig.",3
"I've never liked the cracker barrel but 1 in our party does. However even she didn't eat her food. Nobody did. It's not unique to this location.  I've been to cracker barrels in several states and I can tell you that they are consistent,  consistently terrible!",1
"I absolutely LOVE The Cracker Barrel! It is definitely my traveling eatery ;-) No matter where my road trips take me I search for a Cracker Barrel FIRST! I've been to several from the Carolinas to So Cal! Love, love, love!!!",4
Horrible horrible service. We waited over 40 minutes for a table when there was clearly empty tables. The food was horrible. We had a group of 11 and not one person was happy. I would not visit this place again. The fried chicken was not bad though.,1
Crackers Barrels are starting to go done hill in their food quality,3
Omg this place has amazing breakfast. You have to try it if you enjoy the classic breakfast of eggs bacon pancakes and grits etc. I would post pictures but their in my other phone.,5
Had Thanksgiving dinner here. Very nice and at a very fair price. The server was exceptional and all the people are very friendly.,5
It's a busy joint ! Sunday Breakfast had about a 30 minute wait to be seated... once sat prompt service and food came out in a timely manner relative to how the tables were sat.  I wasn't impressed with my over medium eggs and the biscuits just didnt seem fresh.  Guess since they've made home in Vegas it's not as good as taking the drive to Kingman... Lumberjacks might be a better alternative down the road a bit...,3
Food was delicious and staff was quick and friendly. Very clean. Cute store! Will come back!,5
A different design than we've ever seen. Worked well. Good service and clean. Consistent food.,5
We sat for 15 minutes before someone took our drink order.  Food took 40 minutes to arrive cold. The server never checked on us. I complained to a manager who got new food to us in 5 minutes. Server just dropped to go boxes while she walked by. A manager never came back to see if everything was ok. Complained to another manager while paying for the food and they did credit the meal. I was not looking for a free meal. I was looking for customer service.,1
"Good food had fried chicken,  service was very good,  would go there again",4
First time last time food was bland tasteless service was mediocre in town from California took the opportunity as there's no cracker barrel near me and with a family total of 11 of us and only two people are satisfied with their meal,1
First time eating here for breakfast it’s pretty nice and good food except to steak I got it’s burnt,5
"It's not the worst cracker barrel, but the one in St George is definitely better. If you can, visit a different location before trying this one. Probably won't be back for a while...😢",2
"Great service over all. They had a long wait time, so we got on the waitlist online. When we got there they said it was going to be an additional 30min. We spoke to a manager named Steve who helped us out immediately. Call ahead of time and get a table online to avoid waiting.",5
Here for work been here 2 times service is the worst I’ve seen at a Cracker Barrel staff really isn’t friendly. Food was ok but you could tell it had been sitting for awhile max and cheese was horrible. Waitress never came for a soft drink refill. The Cracker Barrel’s back home in Tennessee have higher standards than here,1
"It started great with our waiter Rowan and the young lady Alesha who placed us. We placed our order and 30 to 45 minutes later we were told I food was running late because of a huge order of police officers that arrived after us and we understood that. The table to my left and right were told the same and both had been seated at least 20 minutes after us. We were offer biscuits while we wait. Then both of the tables beside us are eating there breakfast and we are still waiting for ours. Ok unusual but it happens right. Finally 20 minutes later our food comes and my aunt's pancakes appears to have been sitting in the back and the meal I received was not correct! Granola and yogurt  give me indigestion so I certainly wouldn't have order it for breakfast. Good morning breakfast which was supposed to be 2 egg whites, grits with cheese, tomato slices and Turkey sausage. I have to say I know it was busy since the police officers 20 to 25 came in, the people on both side of us doesn't mean we should receive less service then anyone else that was there. My wife was jealous that my aunt took me there when I told her we were waiting for our meal but now I not sure if I will bring her since it was my first time there and she has never been.",1
"If you have been to one , you have been to them all. Always packed and slow service. Our biscuits were literally DOUGH. We have to request ones that were fully cooked.",3
Omg the food was great and did some shopping,5
"Who doesn't love Grandma's home cooking! Nostalgic store,  some of the oldies candy i grew up eating you can find here.",5
Worst dining experience ever.  I took the family here because we used to eat at Cracker Barrel in Florida all the time and loved it.  We have never been to this Cracker Barrel.  It started off bad immediately.   We were seated and it was over 10 minutes before our server even acknowledged we were there and then she didn't even ask us if we wanted something to drink.  When she brought the biscuits and cornbread there was honey or jam.  Apparently you have to request that special but we were not told that.  Also the butter was rock hard. The applebutter is nasty.  We couldn't tell what it was and had to be told.  She did bring us more biscuits with honey and jam.  When our food came it was awful.   Ham in one meal was like leather and sausage in another was like a hockey puck.  Most of the meals were not hot.  Vegetables were over cooked.  There were three orders of fried apples and one had no cinnamon on it at all.  When I complained to the managers it took 10 minutes at the register because they didn't know how to use it.  After all that waiting they only took half off of two meals.  They have the worst quality control and customer service I have ever seen in a restaurant.   I will never visit this Cracker Barrel again.,1
Nice store and decent food,4
"Slow service, unhappy servers, over 10 minutes for 1 slice of toast with restaurant less than 50% capacity. Other customers complaining. Does not offer the usual menu available in other states.",2
Had a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner.,1
Always good,5
"This was our 4th trip here. Just kept giving them one more try, hoping it would improve after they have been open a while but was I wrong. Have eaten at CB all over the country but CB should close this one because it’s giving them a bad reputation, I can some it up in one word it just terrible in so many ways. Will never go to this one again and I love Cracker Barrel",1
"Great food, great prices and a hometown atmosphere",5
Beautiful restaurant inside which is obviously brand new construction.  A little difficult to enter parking lot because there is no driveway on the main road.  You have to turn down a side street and enter from behind the restaurant.,5
"The breakfast we ordered..ie: pancakes with sausage, ham& bacon...the sausage & ham is TOUGH & TOO SALTY...i just got a bite of d sausage & ham & did not bother to finish it. Pancakes are not fluffy...its ""chewy"" meaning its hard....This place is too Noisy for me...I better go back to IHOP..!!",2
The breakfast food was delicious.  I also enjoy browsing throughout the store looking at the many different types of items.,4
This place is clean and the staff is great and the food is great,5
Pretty good food needs some help to wait on tables,4
Outstanding food and service. The whole family extremely satisfied.,5
Very pleasant. Great environment. Excellent staff. Amazing food!,5
Great food! And the store has amazing lil things you can buy!,5
"Even though it's out here in the desert, they carry the atmosphere well here. The service and food is pretty good.",5
Food was great and server was friendly and amazing!,5
We had Pecan pancakes they were very good.Clean very friendly service. Fun looking around the country stoor.,5
"Excellent, home-style food.  Our waitress, April was super sweet!",5
"I didnt care for the breakfast I ordered and the eggs were under done.  The hash brown casserole was unappealing, the country gravy was thin and flavorless.  The meal comes with grits so I tried them and I have one question ""people like grits?"" Truely bland and tasteless. The ham and bacon were good.  I doubt I'll ever try their breakfast again. Maybe one of their signature dinners if I ever go back.",2
"Good food, great prices, fun atmosphere, and beautiful gift shop!",5
"Food was dry, tasteless and bland.",1
"The catfish, turnip greens and cornbread is everything🤩",5
Great food. Great service! Great atmosphere.,5
Great food and great customer service. Everyone was professional and polite.,5
Food was cold. Out waitress must have been having a bad day. Or was grossly incompetent. I left a 20% tip out of pity. All around a bad experience.,2
Waited 25 min. for someone to come to our table just to take our drinks. My daughter's French Toast had a the twist tie that they use to close bags of bread cooked into it. The manager came and simply took the item in frustration but that meal was not even deducted nor did we get some sort of discount or compensation.,1
Not the Cracker Barrel I liked when I lived in Virginia. The food was okay I guess. The service wasn't top notch. Things were forgotten with the meal.,3
"Coming from the midwest Cracker Barrel in Vegas was very disappointing. Food was average at best, not very "" country"" feeling or tasting. One and only time that I will visit a Cracker Barrel in the Las Vegas valley.",2
Not interesting at all. Blad menu and bland food. Way too crowded with people packed top close,2
Great service and extremely good food and lots to look at,5
"Outstanding service, has become one of my favorite places to go. The food is great. Melvin Washington.",5
"Food is consistently good.  Great for breakfast , lunch or dinner.  Staff is always so courteous and attentive.",5
Andy was my server. She took my order promptly. However the service was slow. It took quite a while before she brought my ice tea...and after the meal was delivered...she never asked if it was okay or if she could bring anything else.  When she finally did come back by I asked for a refill of ice tea...it never happened. When I was ready to leave she came by and said oh yeah I remember that ice tea....I told her to forget it...I am leaving.,3
"It's a chain restaurant, keep your expectations low. Portions are pretty standard but the sides seem rather miniscule. The food itself is fairly bland and could use some more spices. Regardless they tend to get busy so service can lag. The tables are all very close so it's a very cramped and loud dining experience.",3
You can share with a little human. Big portions go hungry!,5
Excellent service. Excellent hot food. Friendly service and employees.,5
"Wonderfully varied menu options,
excellent food and excellent service",5
Very tasty food and nice family atmosphere cool Little stuff in store also,5
Good food. Friendly service. Attentive wait staff. Usually crowded but worth the wait.,5
"Always amazing, hopefully you're lucky enough to get Stacy, she was awesome!",5
"Great country food,excellent service and an ambience to match. First experience, we'll be back again..!",5
I have been to many Cracker barrels this one wont get my business again food make us sick service was less than good not up to company standards dont know how it could be so different but it was it's a shame they have only been there a short while,1
This is THE Best place to come unique items and great food. Service is fantastic. Staff are very friendly and helpful.,5
Still a good place for breakfast.,4
The breakfast I had was great. A real old fashion bacon eggs hash browns and toast cooked to perfection. 😘,5
Love those pecan pancakes! Good service & friendly folks. Their online waiting list helps greatly with waiting to be seated.,5
"Good food, good prices.",4
"A few friends and I went out for a movie and decided to grab a bite, I heard good things about this place so I figured I would try it. I wasn't impressed at all with the food it was average. The service was good although we did wait about 20 minutes to be seated. I really cannot figure out why this place is busy, I have had so really good burgers and I do not feel this was one of them.",4
Omg  food  atmosphere and gift shop. Loved it.,5
The stuff was friendly. Our waitress Tanae was very attentive and pleasant. Fast service with a smile. The food amazing. We will be back.,5
"Disappointed that when the medium rare steak came out, it was more well done than a McDonald's burger.  The manager's solution? Steak in a to go box.  Really? You screwed up, he only got to eat eggs and sides for breakfast and I still paid full price for the experience. This was Thursday 3/30/17 (my ten year wedding anniversary btw). Looking at other reviews, how did I not even get offered a piece of chocolate cake?",2
"Great food. I love the place
First time.",5
I love the gift shop as it always changes and the menu is basically the same but it's good to come in and try everything at least once breakfast and dinner menu. Expect to wait a long time to be served but it's ok as long as u have the time and ur not in a rush. I personally am not impressed with any of the breakfast cold coffees even if they look so cute on the menu. They always taste gross and I end up wasting money and get a water sadly after. I recommend if u like Louisiana hot sauce they have a version of their own u can ask for upon request and it is mighty tasty. For dinner if u like fish get that cus it's really good! Bring in the kids too cus they will enjoy the atmosphere. 😀,4
"I love the country store here in NLV but, they need a better cook. I first went to Cracker Barrell in Utah where the food was excellent. Then I went to the Las Vegas store, by the Bass Pro shop & it to was very good. But sadly not in North Las Vegas",5
Food is good with large portions.girl friend can't stay out of the country store so plan on spending double o your bill.lol,4
"Perfect breakfast food & service. Nice to see young people working hard and being well mannered. Yes, I'm old.",5
Great family place. Excellent service from Zach .Food was delicious and prompt. Definitely coming back!!!!,5
"Visited from out of town and it WAS my 1st time there. Service was good, food was great. They also have a a store where u can buy merchandise.",5
We had a long wait time when there was no reason for it .There was hardly anybody in the restaurant. By the time we got our food it was ice cold. But the waiter was nice. And the manager tried to fix it.,3
"From hamburgers so big that they could barely fit in your mouth to breakfast for dinner, this place is a prime example of American culinary culture. 👌For a first time, it sucks that I didn't bring a group with me. 😂",4
"Good food, good price, great service.",5
"Easy to find off the I-15, very short wait and the food was great. 👍 Enjoyed the large checkers by the outside rocking chairs.",4
"Worst service, mediocre food and 100% over rated. Will never return and will never recommend.",1
Poor service.  ordered soup with dinner and got it after the entree arrived. Ordering coffee with dinner and it came when the entree also arrived. The burger I ordered was at best okay. Not a great place for dinner.,3
"Waitress spilled hot coffee on my grandmother and admitted she didnt check the coffee pot correctly. They gave me a bill for our table of 3 for $28. I respectfully and quietly spoke with the manager and advised him that I believed the meal should be taken care of completely. He told me he spoke with his general manager and they thought it was plenty of compensation to take of one $9 meal. Wow. Never coming back. The food was not all that either. Better catfish at ella ems not one mile west on craig. Better breakfast at Jamms, Original Pancake House, egg & I just to name a few. We eat out often and I have never experienced such a lack of understanding of customer service.",1
You can never go wrong at a Cracker Barrel,5
"One thing I can say about this place is that they have excellent customer service. The staff is friendly and the food is good. Especially the breakfast items, in my opinion.",4
Ashley was very nice the food was ok... we will be back but this time to try lunch menu,4
"The food is great, but is super busy and the servers are really busy! So it can take awhile to get like a steak knife or butter if they forget. Otherwise would be a 5 star!",4
"If you don't enjoy yourself here,  there may be no help for you! Friendly staff and good food!",5
The service was horrible. It took forever for a server to come to us and let us order our drinks. After we waited about 10 minutes just for our drinks. My sister had to flag down the waitress and remind her for our drinks. This wouldnt be such a problem if it was busy but it wasn't. After our food came out our server never checked up on us to refill our drinks. And for a $9 hamburger there was only a small handfull of fries. The manager was nice as we told him the problems but by then we were all upset and ready to leave.,2
A really fun place with good food and good prices. They are understaffed so service is okay but not great.  They have a cery unusual store attached with a huge variaty of products.,5
First off the food is always fresh and tastes so good and you don't have to wait long after you order. Sometimes the waite staff is slow and don't check back on you.Not all the waite staff is like this. All in all its a good place to eat and shop.,5
"It's a hit or miss on cracker barrel in las vegas. Last weekend was great service and amazing food. This weekend however, the service felt a little tired and cranky and the food was cold and bland. It probably wont stop me from trying again, but I'm also not going to shy away from sending food back to the kitchen.",3
Good food,5
"Dinner was so good, the Earth was mad I paid for it, a 7.1 earthquake hit when I paid! Cray-cra!",5
"Food is always great. A little annoying when you order online and get a time to be there but it seems they don't start cooking the order until you are actually there. Just let me know that's what's going on but thanks for the freshness, I guess",4
"Great friendly service, atmosphere, and delicious food. Favorite place. In LOVE with the shop!",5
"Wait staff was very attentive. The roast beef was cooked to perfection. However, the slabs of onion in the gravy were off-putting and inedible, imo (I love onion btw).  The atmosphere is noisy-muzak, cacophony of other patrons conversations. On the cleanliness scale, there should be attention to detail: the windows were smudged with fingerprints and splatters, table top and chair seats were sticky as were table top condiments containers. The general store is claustrophobic and nearly impossible to navigate due to volume of customers and cramped aisles. The atmosphere lacks the cozy charm of the St. George, Utah Cracker Barrel, a standard which should be emulated to exactness.",3
My eggs were cold my ham was dry and cold.  I have been to many Cracker Barrel locations across the country and have a certain expectation when I go there.  It definitely was not met here.,1
An Amalgam of American goodies to buy,5
"We love Cracker barrel. Friendly staff, great service, wonderful food. Looking forward to the next visit.",5
"Good service, low wate time, good food",5
Very nice place to go.,5
"The food is always good. Depending on the day of the week, service gets a little slow with the busier it is. Staff is always helpful and kind.",4
"Pricey, took an hour to get food. Not impressed",2
Very good food and very nice waitress,5
Always good food and customer service.,5
definitely would not be going back . What ever they server as meat loaf  was dry sort of burnt  😫,3
Grandpa's Breakfast!,5
"We love Cracker Barrell!
I always love anything and everything that I have ordered. This time wasn't crazy about the Applewood Chicken. A bit dry. (Just won't order it again) 😒 The sides were fabulous along with my side salad and corn bread. Then off to the store. I bought my granddaughter her Easter 🐰 outfit. So beautiful from the frilly white dress with rhinestones and pink flowers, pink shoes, sunglasses to hair bows and more. Love love love Cracker Barrell!",5
Great food great staff short wait time,5
"Very nice service, clean and friendly environment.",5
"Typically, Cracker Barrel is my go-to. Especially this particular Cracker Barrel. I've been to this place on dead weekdays, crowded weekends and packed holidays and yet I've never had bad service or bad food until yesterday. It's a Saturday around 1pm, we pull up and easily find a parking spot near the front. It's not packed, just a bit busy. 25 minute wait was only 15 minutes. We get seated and a new waitress I've never seen before comes up about 10 minutes after we're seated to take our order. I heard her saying to another customer she got called in on a saturday and she's new, so I figured she's pretty stressed. She still manages to smile and takes our drinks and food order at the same time since we've been waiting for a while. Me and my party of 3 (plus my little one) are usually pretty patient and understanding of new/busy workers anywhere we go. We've all been there, right? Well, I ordered a sweet tea and water. The other two all ordered sweet tea as well. Milk for the little one. She brought no water and no cup for the milk, just the carton. I thought hmm, okay. We poured the milk into her extra sippy cup and made it work. While ordering, she asked my boyfriend how he wanted his eggs cooked 3 times because she couldn't focus. He spoke loud and clear but she was looking around and not at him. It took her about 10 minutes and 4 times of her passing by me and not looking up for me to get her attention and ask for the water. She brought it, didn't leave a straw. She dropped one on the floor instead as she walked away so I got up to get it. A nice busboy did ask me if I wanted a fresh one, I said no that's okay. It was still wrapped in its paper so it's no big deal. My boyfriend ordered the hershels breakfast with the beef patty. He ordered that medium. It came well done, unseasoned and the meat tasted off so he had one bite and I did too to confirm the meat was bad. My eggs were over easy, not over medium, hashbrown casserole, grits and gravy were all cold. We had to ask 3 different people for hot sauce and ketchup even though there was some on our table when we got there. Oddly enough someone came before our food came to pick up all the condiments? I didnt see one person on the wait staff that I recognized and I go there at least once a month since it opened. Obviously it's not the same cooks either because that food was not up to their usual standards. I'm not sure if they just lost a lot of people or what but we won't be back for a while. Not after being served bad meat and cold food.",1
Great food and service,5
I love this place. Very amazing both a restaurant and a shopping place.,5
They forgot to give me one of my sides that I ordered.  I also didn't like the turnip greens like I thought I would. They need to have spinach greens .,3
Absolutely love the store restraint combo who doesn't love just about everything cracker barrel has to offer,5
"Good food, prices and staff",5
"People were but didn't enjoyed my experience. I ordered chicken fried chicken, what I got seems to be chicken fried steak. Did I ordered the wrong item? Check my bill and its stated CFC. Oh and our server didn't even offer dessert before giving us the bill. First time and probably the only time.",3
Good portions good service many choices,4
always awesome as usual,5
Good Cracker Barrel.,4
"Love love love this place. I often stop to see what I ""need"" from the  little country store and the the food in the restaurant is awesome.",5
It was me and my husband first time eating there and our last. We asked for cheese in our eggs..no cheese. We asked for orange juice..orange juice was frozen. We settled for apple juice..even with the ice in it..it was not cold. THEN TO TOP OFF THINGS I FOUND HAIR ON MY BACON...TOLD THE MANAGER HE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT TRY TO OFFER US MORE FOOD. All the hype was for nothing!,1
"Food was ok at best and the service was terrible. I ended up with a slimy salad! Weird part was we went on a Saturday night, place was dead probably due to the service and poor food quality.",1
Umm... staff was Very nice. Food... well.. it is Cracker Barrel its like old cafeteria food.,2
Kathryn from Tennessee was a wonderful server...very professional EXCELLENT customer service...loved the food! Thx Kathryn,5
"as perfect and great as always, great food, very friendly staff, lovely shop...a place like home",5
"We live in California and everything we visit Vegas this is the place we have to como eat at. I love the food, the ambiance and the confort you feel eating here. Staff always friendly and prompt, I always buy some of their pancake mix to bring home it is delicious.",5
Food was as or better than I remember from eating Cracker Barrel in Florida. Service definitely better. All staff very nice!,5
The food was really good...  But are server rush us. We never been there before and the server kept coming over to our table asking us if we made up our mind yet. She had the check down at our table before we even started our dinner,3
My favorite home cooked food with lots of clothes and baked goods to look at cozy.,5
Great for many reasons like vacations or family outings,5
"So love having Cracker Barrel close to home, definitely one of my favorite places to eat, food is country style and very tasty.",5
"Food was good, weren't very generous with coffee. Server came by once with coffee then never came by again.",3
"Staff was very pleasant. Food is inexpensive, but not great. Service was slow. Food came warm, but not really warm enough.",3
Great experience!  It was my daughter's birthday and they wished her a happy birthday with desert.  Thanks,5
"Worst service, worst food ever! So disappointed 😢",2
Great food and service,5
"The only reason why I'm giving this restaurant one star is because  I can't give them zero stars. My wife and I waited 40 minutes for our food. Our food was taken to two different tables before the server realized that the food was for my table. The waiter allowed the people at the other tables to breath on the food, which really grossed me out, and then he tried to give it to me and my wife. My wife and I walked out without eating. This was our second try at this restaurant. The first time we were there wasn't good either. We won't be back.",1
"HORRIBLE!! Coffee was 5 times weaker than the iced tea!! Waitress was awful. Food took forever to come out;  and, when it didn't, our appetizers were with it and everything was COLD. I   NEVER DID get my cup of soup OR salad. Manager apologized and offered to recook everything, but we did NOT have time!! At least we were not charged!! 'Cause we left it ALL on the table. I'm DONE with CRACKER BARREL FOREVER!! Only reason it gets a star is because I couldn't TAKE ANY AWAY!!!!!😤😤😤",1
"The service  was very bad it took a long time  to get our food over 45 minutes

They  claim theirs  a new pos system  that the waitresses aren't  quite familiar with...

We asked for the manager  he Comes over wasn much help
Didn't  offer  a discount  or anything  ..just said  everyone  meal was taking  long..
Ive  been  to crackle barrel in Louisiana  and also  Colorado springs. This was by  far the worst service  EVER!!!!!!

The Best pancakes and syrup service a little slow,4
"Horrible Service, Food was Burnt and flavorless,  manager was full of apologies without actually listening to my complaint. In Texas this was my favorite breakfast place of all time, we have given the Vegas Location two opportunities now, and both times very disappointing.  I will never be eating here again.",1

I love this place. Food is great. It's gotta be my #2 favorite restaurant.,5
Love the shop outside restaurant. Also love the whole look of the restaurant.,5
"Too long to get order, no utensils, no butter, grits were cold, eggs were dry. For this being an old fashioned breakfast place, we had to ask for everything that should have automatically been on the table 🤔",1
Love the food and the country store.,5
Always a pleasure at this Cracker Barrel. Just don't try coming here when NASCAR's in town. ;),5
Im happier at ihop or dennys,1

Good price for good food and service,5
"I had the lemon trout for lunch and it was good, but the staff sort of forgot about us during the meal.",3
"The food, the old-fashioned candy, the clothing and the staff are great!",5
"I have eaten at Cracker Barrels all over the country. This was the worst experience. We waited longer in the staging area than outside. My friend ordered pancakes with nothung on it, it arrived with butter on it.  I decided to order dessert, my friend got hers. She was finished when they finally came over to tell me they were out of my pie. We had the manager sit with us, discussed our issues but refused to comp us or comensate us in any way. I will never go back. Poor management, poor training.",1
Slow service,3
The food is always delicious and Donna was a great waitress. The country store is always fun to browse after the meal.,5

"Food was okay. Nothing spectacular. Manager went out of his way to make sure everything was good, they got the order wrong and corrected very quickly.",3
This is the last time we will be eating here. The customer service was terrible and the food was worse.,2
"The next time I get this bad service I am walking out before I order.  The server finally came to my table after 2 other tables were visited by another server.  When he showed up I had to request he repeat himself because he kept talking and looking in another direction.
My order was wrong and when I brought it to his attention he acted as though I was at fault.
No one did much of anything about it either.
I will certainly not return to this location.",2
My soson ordered the chicken fried chicken and it was overcooked and rubbery.  My beef noodle soup had a piece of foil in it and service was super slow.,2
"Always good food, nice country atmosphere  & friendly waiters.",5

I love cracker barrel best place to eat,5
If you've ever been to a cracker barrel in the midwest do NOT go to this one.  Horrible doesn't start to describe the taste of the food.  If you've never been to one in the midwest I suggest you skip this location and go for a trip.,1
"our waitress was amazing, food was great.",5
This place sucks on waiting waited 1 hour and still didn’t tell me how much longer,1
Food is always really good here! I got the rib eye and asked for medium rare but it was medium well and it wasn't a good quality cut so that's my only complaint.,5
"Its cozy, but loud. Only denny's food is worst than here, underseason, slow food service, the complimentary bread was brought to our table after our main entrees.",2
Great place for awesome tasting food at reasonable prices.,5
"I love Cracker Barrel and this location is no exception. Great deals for lunch and dinner meals, hefty portion/meal sizes and always delicious.",5

Watery grits but everything else was good.,3

Had peach cobbler for dessert - that didn't have enough crust, in my opinion, more stewed-peaches than cobbler.",4

Went to Cracker Barrel on Craig Rd December 30th and was disappointed. My food was undercooked another meal was overcooked there was hair in the chicken and dumplings we ordered a adult dinner plate of chicken tenders and they looked liked a childs plate. By the time we got back our meals we were able to eat a couple of bits and had to box up our meals because we had somewhere to go. Our waitress was great and needs to be recognized for her services. We left her a $13 tip. I don't know what happened because we have eaten there several times.,1
"Food was over cooked, service slow. Usually cracker barrel has been a good value.",2
First off waited about 30 minutes to be seated waited another 30 minutes to get our food other people were being seated and served their food before us and we easily had 10 minutes ahead of them by the time we got our food the biscuits and gravy were cold. Won't be coming back again.,2
"Love Cracker barrel
Cashiers were fantastic and server and new rising stars great.we have gone back three more times and every time is better .",5
Phenomenal food!  The service was pretty darn good also.  :)     The oerson seating us struggled a bit but its well worth the wait.,5
No wow factor here. This is the second time I have taken my family and the second location. This was a bit better than the first but We won't be back. Mediocre food and less than enthusiastic staff.,3
I love cracker barrel. I visit every time I'm in Vegas!,5
"Very nice place, and the employee Stacy are the best, thanks",5
Can't complain food and service was on point,5
Always the best place to go for good food like at home cooking and the store is amazing,5
